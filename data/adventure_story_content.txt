at it, too.
Kazuto

You would...
Kazuto
799999999_36_a
I don't want to be a pop star so
much as I think it'd be cool to
sing in front of an audience.
Agil
799999999_35_a
YOU want to be a pop star?
Kazuto
799999999_34_a
<Zu
For the millionth time, I...
Wait, what?
Kazuto
799999999_33_a
Well then, how about I join up
with your group when the real deal
gets released?
Agil
799999999_32_a
D-Dude, how many times do I have
to tell you? No way!
Kazuto
799999999_31_a
You totally wanted to be a pop
star, didn't you?
Agil

Then I'll see you both later.

I should be able to
dive in tonight, too.
Agil
799999999_27_a

Kazuto
799999999_26_a
I'll see you at the usual
spot in ALO?
Asuna
799999999_25_a
h_u
Okay, okay, if you say so.
Alright, I should get going.
Asuna
799999999_24_a
I told you before, I just like
experiencing everything a game
has to offer!
Kazuto
799999999_23_a
Th-That's not what I meant...!
Kazuto
799999999_22_a
Hau
Hehe, I knew it, you secretly
wanted to get on stage and sing
this whole time!
Asuna
799999999_21_a
Yeah, and then maybe they'll let
the guys be pop stars, too!
Kazuto
799999999_20_a
Tdu
Maybe it'll get popular enough for
them to make a whole game
out of it.
Agil
799999999_19_a
Either way, this was probably
some sort of test version, right?
Agil
799999999_18_a
Who knows, maybe they figured
they'd let the girls strut their
stuff on stage or something.
Kazuto
799999999_17_a
Dgu
Well, there tend to be more guys
in VRMMOs...
Kazuto
799999999_16_a

Hmm, you have a point. All the
pop stars in our group and in
Seven's were girls...
Asuna
799999999_15_a
$fu
You sure it's random? Not 'cause
you're a guy?
Agil
799999999_14_a
4iu
You get assigned a random role
the first time you dive in, and
that's the one I got.
Kazuto
799999999_13_a
N-No! I was their manager.
Kazuto
799999999_12_a
What? Wait, were you a pop star
in the game, too?
Agil
799999999_11_a
I dunno, I can't really picture
you as a pop star, Agil.
Kazuto
799999999_10_a
Hiu
Huh... Sounds pretty interesting.
Makes me wish I could've tried
it out after all.
Agil
799999999_9_a
the more I loved improving my
singing abilities, and helping the
group perform better and better.
Asuna
799999999_8_a
Hehe, yeah. It was kind of weird
at first, but the more I played,
Asuna
799999999_7_a
but adding those singing
mechanics made it play far
differently than any other game.
Kazuto
799999999_6_a
Dlu
It was pretty much your basic
combat-centric VRMMO,
Kazuto
799999999_5_a
Yeah... But it was a blast,
wasn't it?

ふふっ、いいじゃない～
レイちゃんにやらせてあげましょう
ツェリスカ

クレハ

デイジー
408100201_14_a
そうね……
正攻法だけどまずそれで
やってみましょうか
ツェリスカ
408100201_13_a
囮で誰かが出てヘイト集めてる間に
後ろから周り込んで叩くとか
そういう戦法がいいですかね?
クレハ
408100201_12_a
なかなか手が込んでるわね
どうします、ツェリスカさん?
クレハ
408100201_11_a
なるほど……!

アファシス
408100101_25_a
ツェリスカさん
さすが詳しいですね!
クレハ
408100101_24_a
だからプレイヤーの性格や接し方で
全く異なるパーソナルが出来上がると
言われているわ
ツェリスカ
408100101_23_a
デイジー
408100101_22_a
ええ、そうね
プレイヤーと交流を重ねて
それぞれが自我を芽生えさせていくの
ツェリスカ
408100101_21_a
プレイヤーにナビキャラとして
付き従うオリジナルNPC……
でも全然性格は違うんですよね
クレハ
408100101_20_a
アファシス
408100101_19_a
ふふっ、でも
GGOのサポートAIって
面白いですよね
クレハ
408100101_18_a
いえ、そういうわけではありません
デイジー
408100101_17_a
も～っ、デイジーちゃんったら
仲が良いって言われて
照れちゃってるのかしら～?
ツェリスカ
408100101_16_a
ツェリスカ
408100101_15_a

確かあの人とはこのGGOで
久しぶりに再会したのよね
ツェリスカ
408100101_9_a
デイジー
408100101_10_a
いやいや、ただの腐れ縁ですよ

Kirito
407801201_36_a
Ha ha, it seems all of this has
piqued your interest in the
circus!
Sakuya
407801201_35_a
Sinon
407801201_34_a
Ooh, that could be fun!
Maybe there's more to the event!
Leafa
407801201_33_a
Sakuya
407801201_32_a
That's actually not a bad idea!
Kirito
407801201_31_a
Why don't you go join them, then?
They said they'd be staying here
for a while.
Sinon
407801201_30_a
Sinon
407801201_29_a
Oh really?
Leafa
407801201_28_a
Sakuya
407801201_27_a
I mean, I wouldn't have minded
learning more about acrobatics...
Kirito
407801201_26_a
Leafa
407801201_25_a
Long story short, things got a bit
dicey, but we managed to get the
job done.
Sinon
407801201_24_a
Let me check... Ah, so it is.
Sakuya
407801201_23_a
You've probably already noticed
that the debuff is gone.
Kirito
407801201_22_a
Agreed. They also said they lifted
the magic that prevents us from
flying.
Kirito
407801201_21_a
Kirito
407801201_20_a
Ha ha, very well. This is all good
news.
Sakuya
407801201_19_a
I think we helped them turn a
corner.
Leafa
407801201_18_a
Sinon
407801201_17_a
They were thrilled to hear that
was possible and vowed to keep
creating more incredible tricks.
Leafa
407801201_16_a
Magic that allows them to perform
even more incredible techniques.
Kirito
407801201_15_a
So we advised them to just
incorporate different magic
into their show.
Kirito
407801201_14_a
Kirito
407801201_13_a
Hm...
Sakuya
407801201_12_a
They found out they could,
and the rest is history.
Sinon
407801201_11_a
Then they came to Alfheim
to see if they could use it.
Sinon
407801201_10_a
Leafa
407801201_9_a
They got caught up talking about
this acrobatic technique that has
hypnotic powers.
Sinon
407801201_8_a
Kirito
407801201_7_a
So what happened next?
Sakuya
407801201_6_a
Sinon
407801201_5_a
It's kind of sad, really...
Leafa
407801201_4_a
40w
The remaining members of the
troupe had a similar story.
Kirito
407801201_3_a
Kirito
407801201_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
I see. That certainly explains
a lot.
Sakuya
407801201_1_a
Me too.
Leafa
407801101_28_a
So that's what happened.
Well, I accept your apology.
Sinon
407801101_27_a
My desire to apologize and explain
everything prevented me from
fleeing from you.
Circus Woman
407801101_26_a
Indeed, and I admit that you
all were right to chase after us
upon realizing what we'd done.
Circus Woman
407801101_25_a
Ah, I see. You were so desperate
to hold onto your dream that it
corrupted you.
Leafa
407801101_24_a
I am truly sorry...
Circus Woman
407801101_23_a
The rest of us felt pressured
to accept this line of thinking.
Circus Woman
407801101_22_a
We reasoned that the fairies would
better appreciate our act if they
could not fly.
Circus Woman
407801101_21_a
Hypnosis, huh? So this was some
sort of magic?
Sinon
407801101_20_a
The plan was to hypnotize the
fairies and remove their gift of
flight.
Circus Woman
407801101_19_a
One among us mentioned an
acrobatic technique that had
a hypnotizing effect.
Circus Woman
407801101_18_a
I really want to defend you here,
but I have to admit you're right.
Leafa
407801101_17_a
Who among those with the gift
of flight would find our tricks
amusing? No one.
Circus Woman
407801101_16_a
To any creature that can fly, our
entertainment is no more than
child's play.
Circus Woman
407801101_15_a
You know the rest of the story.
All of the fairies in this land
can fly.
Circus Woman
407801101_14_a
Hm...
Sinon
407801101_13_a
Nevertheless, we wanted to try.
Circus Woman
407801101_12_a
We did not know if people from
a foreign land would see what we
saw in it, much less enjoy it.
Circus Woman
407801101_11_a
We took this challenge seriously.
Circus Woman
407801101_10_a
The island for that Urashima Taro
event was always a possibility
too, I guess.
Sinon
407801101_9_a
Well, we were right about them
coming from the land of humans
we saw in the pirate event.
Leafa
407801101_8_a
So we left our homes in the land
of humans and crossed an ocean
to reach the land of fairies.
Circus Woman
407801101_7_a
We wished to spread the joy of our
circus performance beyond our own
borders.
Circus Woman
407801101_6_a
Hm...
Circus Woman
407801101_5_a
And why?
Kirito
407801101_4_a
Sinon
407801101_3_a
hgw
Kirito
407801101_2_a
DAw
bg_02_forest
What did you do to the people who
came to see the show?
Leafa
407801101_1_a
Hm...
Circus Member
407801001_28_a
We've got you now! Game over!
Kirito
407801001_27_a
No! That's the opposite of what
I should be doing!
Kirito
407801001_26_a
Hm...
Circus Member
407801001_25_a
Hmph!
Kirito
407801001_24_a
Now it's time to see if YOU can
catch up to ME!
Kirito
407801001_23_a
This is how I caught up to you!
Pretty impressive, right?
Kirito
407801001_22_a
I just use vines to fling myself
from tree to tree!
Kirito
407801001_21_a
Looks a lot like your trapeze
moves, doesn't it?
Kirito
407801001_20_a
Ha ha, how about that?
Kirito
407801001_19_a
Argh!
Circus Member
407801001_18_a
Leafa
407801001_17_a
Sinon
407801001_16_a
Hm...
Circus Woman
407801001_15_a
Good point, Sinon.
Excuse me. Why aren't you trying
to escape with the rest of them?
Leafa
407801001_14_a
You find the circus, follow them
into the woods, get stuck, and
then one of them bails you out.
Sinon
407801001_13_a
This must be the way this event
flows.
Sinon
407801001_12_a
Oh right, the circus lady!
Leafa
407801001_11_a
Ha ha, I don't think that would've
happened. Besides...
Sinon
407801001_10_a
Me too! I thought my avatar would
be stuck in these woods for the
rest of forever!
Leafa
407801001_9_a
I'm glad you're out of there.
Sinon
407801001_8_a
Whew! That was a huge help!
Leafa
407801001_7_a
Sinon
407801001_6_a
Whoa! I'm free!
Leafa
407801001_5_a
Yes, like that!
Circus Woman
407801001_4_a
Hrrrrngh!
Leafa
407801001_3_a
Sinon
407801001_2_a
bg_02_forest
Just twist your body a bit...
Circus Woman
407801001_1_a
Hm...
Circus Woman
407800901_23_a
Then why aren't you running away?
Leafa
407800901_22_a
I am, in fact.
Circus Woman
407800901_21_a
You're not with the circus,
are you?
Leafa
407800901_20_a
Huh? Who's asking?
Sinon
407800901_19_a
L9w
Are you trying to get through?
???
407800901_18_a
You little...!
Leafa
407800901_17_a
Heh heh, that's why it was a joke.
Sinon
407800901_16_a
It's not like it'd have any effect
on my avatar! We can't get fat in
VR!
Leafa
407800901_15_a
What kind of a question is that?!
Leafa
407800901_14_a
Have you been hitting the snacks
a bit too hard?
Sinon
407800901_13_a
Sinon
407800901_12_a
RRRRGH! I can't get out!
Leafa
407800901_11_a
Not that I expected anything less
from these guys!
Kirito
407800901_10_a
Gah! Hrngh... They're low-damage,
but they still hit like a thrown
weapon.
Kirito
407800901_9_a
Whoa! They're tossing broken
branches at me like throwing

Kirito

Next!
Circus Member
407800901_7_a
Heh, you're not making this easy
for me, are you? Good! That's just
the way I like it!
Kirito
407800901_6_a
They certainly know how to use
whatever's lying around!
Kirito
407800901_5_a
UNGH! Did one of them just use
a branch like a spring to launch
into me?
Kirito
407800901_4_a
Take this!
Circus Member
407800901_3_a
Stop! This time there's no escape!
Kirito
407800901_2_a
bg_02_forest
Urgh!
Circus Member
407800901_1_a
lbw
Roger that!
Kirito
407800801_25_a
I'll take care of her, Kirito!
Get going!
Sinon
407800801_24_a
Wait! Help me get unstuck first!
Leafa
407800801_23_a
You two keep closing in from this
direction!
Kirito
407800801_22_a
I'll get ahead of them so we can
trap them!
Kirito
407800801_21_a
Oh no, they've spotted me!
Leafa
407800801_20_a
Hmph!
Circus Member
407800801_19_a
<fw
Great work, Leafa! You did it!
Kirito
407800801_18_a
They've been hiding out in here!
Leafa
407800801_17_a
You better believe it!
It's the circus troupe!
Leafa
407800801_16_a
Can you see something on the other
side of the brush?
Kirito
407800801_15_a
Hey, wait, what's that up ahead?
Leafa
407800801_14_a
What were you even trying to do
in the first place?
Sinon
407800801_13_a
Hngh... I'm stuck!
Leafa
407800801_12_a
Djw
Leafa! Are you all right?!
Kirito
407800801_11_a
No, no, no, noooooo!
Leafa
407800801_10_a
HYAH!
Leafa
407800801_9_a
Then step aside! I'll show you
how to get out of this little
forest!
Leafa
407800801_8_a
but most of GGO is spent lying in
wait, so agility's not really my
forte.
Sinon
407800801_7_a
Obviously I'm used to getting
around in GGO without flying,
Sinon
407800801_6_a
He's in true Kirito form, though.
That was almost the exact same
motion as the circus member.
Sinon
407800801_5_a
Sinon
407800801_4_a
Aw, so close!
Leafa
407800801_3_a
UNGH!
Kirito
407800801_2_a
bg_02_forest
And then we leap to the next
branch... HAH!
Kirito
407800801_1_a
4>w
Heh, that just means you'll feel
incredible when we finally pull it
off!
Kirito
407800701_24_a
Hah! Sorry, I just can't help but
laugh. This is crazy!
Sinon
407800701_23_a
It'll be a nice refresher course
for me.
Kirito
407800701_22_a
I can also draw on my two years of
fighting on the ground in SAO.
Kirito
407800701_21_a
We've fought our fair share of
ground battles in ALO. Just recall
those tactics.
Kirito
407800701_20_a
Talk about easier said than done!
What makes you think we can do
that?
Leafa
407800701_19_a
So we'll have to play by their
rules.
Kirito
407800701_18_a
Yeah. We can't afford to sacrifice
mobility by opening our wings.
Kirito
407800701_17_a
But without flying, right?
Sinon
407800701_16_a
Okay, hear me out. We're going
to have to do what they did.
Kirito
407800701_15_a
One clear what? Solution?
Leafa
407800701_14_a
0Ew
Easier said than done. It's not
like there's one...clear...
Kirito
407800701_13_a
Sinon's right! So let's figure
something out already!
Leafa
407800701_12_a
tOw
Same here. We'll have to catch
them if we ever hope to find out,
though.
Sinon
407800701_11_a
But I still don't know why they'd
even do it in the first place.
Kirito
407800701_10_a
The fact that they're running
tells me they know what they've
done and feel guilty about it.
Kirito
407800701_9_a
t5w
Ah, no wonder you're both just
standing here, staring at the
forest.
Leafa
407800701_8_a
Especially since we can't spread
our wings in a forest that dense.
Sinon
407800701_7_a
Their acrobatic abilities will
give them the upper hand in there.
Sinon
407800701_6_a
They fled into the woods. They're
probably still in there, but who
knows if we can find them...
Sinon
407800701_5_a
They got away...
Kirito
407800701_4_a
Sinon
407800701_3_a
Kirito
407800701_2_a
bg_10_field
Hey guys, I made it! What's going
on?!
Leafa
407800701_1_a
No kidding...
Sinon
407800601_24_a
8Nw
They knew they'd be able to use
this terrain to their advantage,
that's for sure.
Kirito
407800601_23_a
Well, unfortunately you were onto
something. I've lost sight of
them.
Sinon
407800601_22_a
That's what impressed me most.
The adaptability.
Kirito
407800601_21_a
but it does make for some speedy
movement in heavily wooded areas
like this.
Kirito
407800601_20_a
I mean, yeah, circus techniques
are largely useless when we can
just fly in ALO,
Kirito
407800601_19_a
Aww, why not? That was basically
the same technique they use on
the trapeze!
Kirito
407800601_18_a
D?w
Well, you shouldn't be!
Sinon
407800601_17_a
Whoa! I didn't know that'd work on
a tree branch! I'm impressed!
Kirito
407800601_16_a
pSz
Hmph!
Circus Member
407800601_15_a
bg_02_forest
Hold it right there!
Kirito
407800601_14_a
(px
No kidding. They really thought
this through!
Sinon
407800601_13_a
pUw
Argh, that's going to make
tracking them a real pain in
the butt!
Kirito
407800601_12_a
Don't act so impressed!
They're escaping into the forest!
Sinon
407800601_11_a
And fast! Though I don't know what
I expected from a circus troupe.
Kirito
407800601_10_a
They've spotted us!
They're on the move!
Sinon
407800601_9_a
Come on, let's... What?!
Kirito
407800601_8_a
Ha ha, I guess so! We wouldn't
have been able to recognize them
otherwise!
Kirito
407800601_7_a
Heh, it's a good thing you went
in the end!
Sinon
407800601_6_a
And I remember that tent!
That's definitely the troupe!
Kirito
407800601_5_a
Aha! A bunch of people in a
caravan!
Kirito
407800601_4_a
Kirito, look! Over there,
by that rock!
Sinon
407800601_3_a
Sinon
407800601_2_a
bg_10_field
Hm...
Kirito
407800601_1_a
Kirito
407800501_18_a
tfw
Right behind you!
Sinon
407800501_17_a
Let's go, Sinon!
Kirito
407800501_16_a
Got it. Try not to run yourself
ragged.
Kirito
407800501_15_a
I'm stuck on the ground, but I'll
do my best to keep up!
Leafa
407800501_14_a
Yeah, that seems likely.
Let's head east.
Sinon
407800501_13_a
The next logical stop would be
Salamander territory.
Kirito
407800501_12_a
For sure. And if they went from
Cait Sith to Sylph territory...
Kirito
407800501_11_a
Okay, this circus troupe is
looking shadier by the second.
Leafa
407800501_10_a
Right. And I think that checks out
because I heard another player say
they did something similar.
Kirito
407800501_9_a
0 w
Which magically renders him immune
to the effects of whatever it is
the performers did to attendees.
Sinon
407800501_8_a
Okay, so let's recap. Kirito gets
bored at the show and dozes off...
Sinon
407800501_7_a
You sounded way too proud when you
said "nap-lover" just now.
Leafa
407800501_6_a
Dew
Ha ha, but they wouldn't just
skip over every nap-lover in the
audience, would they?
Kirito
407800501_5_a
Yeah, that sounds like a pretty
Kirito thing to do.
Sinon
407800501_4_a
Kirito
407800501_3_a
Sinon
407800501_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
You have GOT to be kidding me.
Leafa
407800501_1_a
lhw
Well, uh... Ha ha...
Kirito
407800401_28_a
Did you think of a reason?
Leafa
407800401_27_a
X'w
What's your deal?
Sinon
407800401_26_a
I honestly have no... Oh!
Kirito
407800401_25_a
So why weren't you affected,
Kirito?
Leafa
407800401_24_a
,(w
Sure sounds to me like attending
the circus is the cause of people
losing the ability to fly!
Leafa
407800401_23_a
And now they're totally grounded.
Sinon
407800401_22_a
$+w
I didn't go to the show,
but Alicia and Silica did.
Sinon
407800401_21_a
Then how were you able to fly
here, Sinon?
Kirito
407800401_20_a
Yep, that sounds familiar!
Leafa
407800401_19_a
8+w
The next day, everyone who went
got some strange debuff that
prevents them from flying.
Sinon
407800401_18_a
They put on a show a few days ago
that was open to the public.
Sinon
407800401_17_a
D.w
I know that the same thing that
happened in Cait Sith territory
seems to be happening here.
Sinon
407800401_16_a
d-w
Hpw
Wait, do you know something,
Sinon?
Kirito
407800401_15_a
Argh!
Sinon
407800401_14_a
l.w
They were here until yesterday.
It looks like they packed up and
left today.
Kirito
407800401_13_a

Where are they now?!
Sinon
407800401_12_a

Oh, uh...yeah...

Has the circus come through here

Leafa
407800401_8_a
Sorry to interrupt!
Sinon

Looks like she flew here at top
speed. But what's she doing in
Sylph territory?
Kirito
407800401_6_a
pbw
Sinon?! Is that you?
Leafa
407800401_5_a
D3w
Leafa! Kirito! There you are!

We could probably catch them if we
leave now...

Kirito

Sylvain? What do we do now?
Leafa

Argh, we just missed them.
Kirito

They've already packed up and left
for the next stop on their tour.

Are you guys here to see the
circus too?
Player

They're gone!

Kirito
407800301_27_a
Are you kidding me?!
Leafa

LOx
I'll go too. Lead the way!
Kirito
407800301_25_a
d:w
Beats me, but I'm gonna go ask
those circus freaks some
questions!
Leafa
407800301_24_a
L:w
0}w
Is it a new type of debuff?
And why haven't I been affected?
Kirito
407800301_23_a
It's got some weird icon on it
that I've never seen before.
Leafa
407800301_22_a
What's your status screen say?
Kirito
407800301_21_a
$<w
The only common thread between
us is that we all went to the
circus yesterday!
Leafa
407800301_20_a
And I'm not the only one!
Sakuya lost hers too!
Leafa
407800301_19_a
Say what?!
Kirito
407800301_18_a
I can't fly anymore! My wings
won't deploy anymore!
Leafa
407800301_17_a
"Changed" how? Pause for a second
and tell me what's going on.
Kirito
407800301_16_a
8?w
Nothing's changed? But...how?
Leafa
407800301_15_a
Why wouldn't I be?
Kirito
407800301_14_a
Are you okay?!
Leafa
407800301_13_a
Leafa? What's up?
Kirito
407800301_12_a
Kirito
407800301_11_a
Kirito!
Leafa
407800301_10_a
And I guess I should admit that
even I fell asleep for a bit...
Kirito
407800301_9_a
XDw
I guess we weren't the only ones
who didn't enjoy the circus.
Kirito
407800301_8_a
$Dw
Hm...
Kirito
407800301_7_a
tEw
Are you serious? I guess it was
REALLY boring, then...
Player B
407800301_6_a
tDw
I totally fell asleep in the
middle of it, ha ha ha!
Player A
407800301_5_a
Considering you can already fly
in ALO? It was kinda boring.
Player A
407800301_4_a

Oh yeah? Was it good?
Player B
407800301_3_a
HFw
Kirito
407800301_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
So I went to see the circus
yesterday.
Player A
407800301_1_a
LGw
I suppose it's possible...
Kirito
407800201_31_a
DHw
They do travel around a lot,
after all.
Sakuya
407800201_30_a
Or perhaps the show is slightly
different at each venue.
Sakuya
407800201_29_a
Maybe they're only focused on
their image instead of the quality
of the show.
Leafa
407800201_28_a
4Jw
Which just makes me wonder why
the troupe even bothers to perform
in the first place.
Kirito
407800201_27_a
I... I think you took the words
right out of my mouth.
Leafa
407800201_26_a
<Mw
Since that danger is nonexistent
in ALO, this was probably the
worst setting for a circus.
Sakuya
407800201_25_a
The performers work hard to keep
that from happening while they
entertain the audience.
Sakuya
407800201_24_a
The trapeze, the trampoline...
The stakes and the thrill come
from the danger of a fall.
Sakuya
407800201_23_a
What can you do? Circus acts are
just more impressive in a world
with gravity.
Sakuya
407800201_22_a
So you both had the same feeling,
then.
Leafa
407800201_21_a
,Ow
There was a lot of talent on
display, but it wasn't anything
special, considering we're in VR.
Kirito
407800201_20_a
Yeah, that whole thing was just...
weird.
Kirito
407800201_19_a
0Rw
But I don't think you need to
mince words with us.
Sakuya
407800201_18_a

It was very nice of you to try,
Leafa...
Sakuya
407800201_17_a

Kirito

And now, for our final act!
The pride and joy of this circus!
The flying trapeze!
Ringmaster
407800201_13_a
I know what you mean...
Kirito
407800201_12_a

A trampoline? I suppose that would
make for exciting acrobatics in
real life, but...
Sakuya

Kirito
407800201_9_a

Leafa

to the fullest today!
Sakuya

one. Rules are rules.
Sakuya

Ha ha, it's not easy being a lord!

Since no harm can befall a lord
here, I've been cleared to attend.
Sakuya

Of course. This is all happening
inside the safe zone.

I'd be up for it, but... A circus?

Yeah, it is! So let's go see them
already!

Well, this circus troupe
made their way across the sea

Leafa

Kirito

Humans exist here? In the land
of the fairies?
Kirito

I've heard they don't have
pointy ears, so I'm guessing
they're human.
Leafa
407800101_10_a
A circus troupe, huh? So they're
not fairies?
Kirito
407800101_9_a
Yep! There's a circus troupe in
town! Seems they're a group of
NPCs wandering across Alfheim.
Leafa
407800101_8_a
Oh yeah?
Kirito

I came to tell you that something
cool is happening in Sylvain!

<ow
Oh, you flatter me!
Do take care now.
Head Priest
407701201_22_a
Hrw
We should be thanking you!
It was an honor meeting one
of our gaming forefathers.
Asuna
407701201_21_a
0rw
Well, as the designer, let me just
say that I'm thrilled you got to
play in the world I constructed.
Head Priest
407701201_20_a
Oh, wonderful!
Head Priest
407701201_19_a
Ttw
No, not really. It's a story
befitting of a head priest.
I liked it.
Asuna
407701201_18_a
0tw
You didn't think the message was
too overbearing?
Head Priest
407701201_17_a
,sw
You got it.
Asuna
407701201_16_a
Asuna
407701201_15_a
You definitely are, but I enjoyed
it all the same. How about you,
Asuna?
Leafa
407701201_14_a
Pvw
But I know I can be a preachy old
trickster too. Forgive me!
Head Priest
407701201_13_a
Xuw
I thought it would be best if you
went in knowing as little as
possible.
Head Priest
407701201_12_a
You'll have to forgive me for
using you as beta testers.
Head Priest
407701201_11_a
Ahh, no wonder it felt like a
parable.
Sinon
407701201_9_a
0ww
Silica
407701201_10_a
And I figured if I were to make my
own, it'd have to be a story
befitting of my priesthood.
Head Priest
407701201_8_a

The story of the old man and his
grandson involved a player-made
quest, which got me interested.
Head Priest
407701201_7_a
4yw
Indeed! I taught myself by
studying other players' quests.
Head Priest
407701201_6_a
Wait, are you saying a player
designed that quest?!
Leafa
407701201_5_a
So you did create it!
Asuna

Leafa
407701201_3_a
Asuna
407701201_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Brilliant! You managed to complete
my quest.
Head Priest
407701201_1_a
Silica
407701101_23_a
You'll see. Let's head back to the
shrine in Kiyomihara.
Asuna
407701101_22_a
Sinon
407701101_21_a
Who did?
Leafa
407701101_20_a
Silica
407701101_19_a
Hehe, he had us right where he
wanted us this whole time.
Asuna
407701101_18_a
See? I knew there was more to
this quest!
Leafa
407701101_17_a
Leafa
407701101_16_a
You're right. A lot of fables and
folktales are meant to teach
lessons like that.
Sinon
407701101_15_a
I feel the same way. This felt
more like an old folk tale.
Silica
407701101_14_a
Silica
407701101_13_a
Yes, but what can you do?
It would've been awfully
convenient if the dogs returned.
Asuna
407701101_12_a
That was a bit of a downer.
Doesn't seem like a happy
ending at all...
Sinon
407701101_11_a
Mmhmm...
Leafa
407701101_9_a
Sinon
407701101_10_a
That's a fine idea.
Asuna
407701101_8_a
We'll start by telling the others
this story. May it serve as a
lesson against our follies.
Townsperson
407701101_7_a
Thank you. We shall do our best
to ensure this never happens
again.
Townsperson
407701101_6_a
I don't think they'll bother you
or your people anymore.
Asuna
407701101_5_a
But in the end, I think we got
through to them.
Asuna
407701101_4_a
Yes. I'm afraid that which is
scorned does not return so easily.
Asuna
407701101_3_a
Asuna
407701101_2_a
bg_event_riverside
So they disappeared into the
mountains, did they?
Townsperson
407701101_1_a
I think they're remembering...
Sinon

Leafa
407701001_46_a

Grrr... Gr...
Wild Dogs
407701001_43_a
...Ruff!
Wild Dogs
407701001_42_a
Do you remember now?
Asuna
407701001_41_a
They've reflected on their
actions. They want you to
come back. To come home.
Asuna
407701001_40_a
This collar used to belong to you.
It's a symbol of the connection
you shared with the villagers!
Asuna

There they are!

Sinon
407701001_32_a
GRRR!!
Wild Dogs
407701001_31_a
Sounds like a plan!
Sinon
407701001_30_a
Silica
407701001_29_a
Leafa
407701001_28_a
It's worth a shot!
Asuna
407701001_27_a
Asuna
407701001_26_a
Silica
407701001_25_a
Hmm, maybe if we show it to them,
they'll remember that they used to
be cared for?
Leafa
407701001_24_a
Do you think we could use it?
Sinon
407701001_23_a
Yeah, apparently they used these
when they owned the dogs. There
was only one left.
Sinon
407701001_22_a
Silica
407701001_21_a
Leafa
407701001_20_a
A collar? And a rather worn one
at that.
Asuna
407701001_19_a
I got this!
Sinon
407701001_18_a
Asuna
407701001_17_a
Silica
407701001_16_a
Hey, Sinon's back!
Leafa
407701001_15_a
Asuna! Guys!
Sinon
407701001_14_a
Leafa
407701001_13_a
It's possible. That's why we've
sent Sinonon back to the village
to have another look.
Asuna
407701001_12_a
Maybe we need to trigger a
scenario or something?
Silica
407701001_11_a
That's okay. What bothers me is
that the game usually seems to
be okay with this approach.
Silica
407701001_10_a
We wasted your time, bringing you
all this way for nothing.
Asuna
407701001_9_a
Oh no, we should apologize to you,
if anything!
Asuna
407701001_8_a
S-Sorry... I couldn't help you...
Silica
407701001_7_a
maybe you can talk to these wild
dogs too?
Leafa
407701001_6_a
So we figured since you're a
Beastmaster who can talk to
animals like a Cait Sith,
Leafa
407701001_5_a
N-Nope...
Leafa
407701001_4_a
Silica
407701001_3_a
Leafa
407701001_2_a
bg_event_riverside
That didn't go so well, did it?
Asuna
407701001_1_a
Exactly!
Asuna
407700901_46_a
Leafa
407700901_45_a
Yeah, they said they won't be
using what we delivered for
another two days. There's time.
Sinon
407700901_44_a
Let's think about it for a minute.
Asuna
407700901_43_a
I don't know... Maybe there's
something more we can do.
Asuna
407700901_42_a
Yes, according to the head priest.
Sinon
407700901_41_a
Was the goal of this quest really
just the delivery of some ritual
stuff?
Leafa
407700901_40_a
Yeah, I guess neither option was
great. That's pretty awful.
Leafa
407700901_39_a
Sinonon's right. They made a
difficult choice for the sake
of their own survival.
Asuna
407700901_38_a
We can't fault them entirely,
though.
Sinon
407700901_37_a
That sounds an awful lot like
selfishness to me...
Leafa
407700901_35_a
Sinon
407700901_36_a
sigh
Asuna
407700901_34_a
That's terrible...
Asuna
407700901_33_a
We turned them loose in the
mountains, in the hopes that
they'd find a way to survive.
Townsperson
407700901_32_a
This is painful to admit, but...
There was a famine some years ago.
Townsperson
407700901_31_a
Did we own them, she asks!
Townsperson
407700901_30_a
I mean, did the village own them?
Leafa
407700901_29_a
Were those wild dogs pets
at some point?
Leafa
407700901_28_a
We hope our prayers will be
enough to eradicate those pests
for good!
Townsperson
407700901_27_a
We're going to use them to pray
that those wild dogs you saw stop
terrorizing our village.
Townsperson
407700901_26_a
Um, may I ask what you're going to
use these ritual items for?
Sinon
407700901_25_a
We noticed. They didn't pose too
much trouble, though.
Asuna
407700901_24_a
Well, those wild dogs have made
their den on the only road between
here and Kiyomihara.
Townsperson
407700901_23_a
We're just glad we could
deliver them safely.
Asuna
407700901_22_a
Asuna

Leafa
407700901_20_a

bg_event_riverside
Ah, the ritual items! Thank you so
much for bringing them all this
way!
Townsperson
407700901_18_a
Me too.
Asuna
407700901_17_a
Yeah, that's pretty tragic...
I feel bad for those dogs now.
Leafa
407700901_16_a
I'll buy that if it's true.
It's a bit too real for me,
but sure.
Sinon
407700901_15_a
They could be dogs that were
abandoned. And now they've gone
feral and attack humans instead.
Asuna
407700901_14_a
Lots of people had dogs back in
the olden days. Maybe that's why?
Asuna
407700901_13_a
You're not wrong. It's a bit
ordinary, now that you mention it.
Leafa
407700901_12_a
We've fought wolves, monsters,
and mythological creatures.
But dogs? That's a first.
Sinon
407700901_11_a
Is that weird?
Asuna
407700901_10_a
Yeah... But really? Wild dogs?
Sinon
407700901_9_a
Asuna
407700901_8_a
Sinon
407700901_7_a
That should do it!

Right behind you!
Asuna
407700801_46_a
Whoa, the dogs! Let's take care of
them first!
Leafa
407700801_45_a
Right on cue.
Sinon
407700801_44_a
Grrrr...!
???
407700801_43_a
Yeah, what could THAT mean?
Asuna
407700801_42_a
Well, he did say "Enjoy!" as we
left. Who says that to someone
doing them a favor?
Leafa
407700801_41_a
No, he doesn't seem dishonest.
He's a head priest... There must
be some hidden meaning there.
Asuna
407700801_40_a
Was the line about him not being
good at combat just an excuse?
Sinon
407700801_39_a
Oh yeah, that IS weird...
Leafa
407700801_38_a
Yeah, I was surprised he didn't
come too. Especially since he's
good at healing and support.
Sinon
407700801_37_a
I'm just wondering why the head
priest didn't come along.
Asuna
407700801_36_a
Is something wrong, Asuna?
Sinon
407700801_35_a
Mmhmm...
Asuna
407700801_34_a
Right. And once we take them out,
all we have to do is deliver the
ritual items to the village ahead.
Asuna
407700801_33_a
A pack of wild dogs should spawn
soon.
Sinon
407700801_32_a
Yes, according to the head priest.
Asuna

Sinon
407700801_30_a
Asuna
407700801_29_a

We just have to keep going, right?
Leafa
407700801_28_a
May I ask something of you three?
Head Priest
407700801_27_a
You know, I don't think it's
coincidence that brought
you here.
Head Priest
407700801_26_a
Yes, and in battle I'm best as
a healer or support unit. I'm a
little old for combat, you see.
Head Priest
407700801_25_a
The job type you selected...
You basically serve the deities,
right?
Leafa
407700801_24_a
A little experience? You've played
enough to earn a shrine! Something
tells me you've got skill.
Sinon
407700801_23_a
Heh heh heh!
Head Priest
407700801_22_a
And I have a little experience
with computer games myself,
so I thought it might be fun.
Head Priest
407700801_21_a
Wow, that's incredible.
Asuna
407700801_20_a
Upon hearing that, I thought
AE might be a game even an
old man like me could enjoy.
Head Priest
407700801_19_a
he was able to find logs of
what his grandson had done in
the game. He died a happy man.
Head Priest
407700801_18_a
And would you believe it? With the
help of the other players in AE,
Head Priest
407700801_17_a
There are rumors of an old man who
wanted to connect with his dearly
departed grandson.
Head Priest
407700801_16_a
For starters, yes.
But it was more than that.
Head Priest
407700801_15_a
So it was the Japanese theme that
drew you in?
Asuna
407700801_14_a
And wouldn't you know it, that's
when I found Asuka Empire!
Head Priest
407700801_13_a
I was designing something on my
computer when I first heard of
VRMMOs, so I looked for one.
Head Priest
407700801_12_a
Precisely. But I found myself
unable to go against generations
of family history.
Head Priest
407700801_11_a
That's why you put your mark on
all the goods you sell at the
shrine.
Sinon
407700801_10_a
I was once very much into design,
you see. I thought that was where
I would make my living.
Head Priest
407700801_9_a
Hah! Well, I suppose it just comes
naturally to me.
Head Priest
407700801_8_a
Leafa
407700801_7_a
This is incredible! You manage
two different shrines in two
different worlds?
Asuna
407700801_6_a
Heh heh, what a coincidence!
Leafa

You two are the girls who helped
out at the real shrine!

Are you really?!
Sinon
407700701_48_a
Could it be?!
Leafa
407700701_47_a
You are?!
Asuna
407700701_44_a
I am indeed a head priest in the
real world, as you suggested.
Head Priest
407700701_43_a
Sinon
407700701_46_a
Leafa
407700701_45_a
I'm sorry?
Asuna
407700701_42_a
You have quite the observant eye,
my dear.
Head Priest
407700701_41_a
Well, well, well...
Head Priest
407700701_40_a
Well, you look the part. You
even look like a real-life head
priest...
Asuna
407700701_39_a
I see.
Asuna
407700701_38_a
I suppose I am the head priest,
but I've not done anything
befitting of the title.
Head Priest
407700701_37_a
I was only given this land after
completing several quests.
Head Priest
407700701_36_a
But I merely chose to be a servant
of the divine in AE.
Head Priest
407700701_35_a
Ha ha! Head Priest! How
delightfully polite! I don't
mind the title, of course...
Head Priest
407700701_34_a
Well, thank you all the same.
We...actually have something
to ask you, Head Priest.
Asuna
407700701_33_a
Oh, it's nothing. I merely
provided the stage upon which the
admins could perform their quest.
Head Priest
407700701_32_a
Thank you so much for all you
did the other day.
Asuna

Asuna
407700701_28_a
Ah, why hello again.
Head Priest
407700701_27_a
The article supposed that the
historical Japan motif was a
bigger draw than the combat.
Sinon
407700701_26_a
I read in an article recently that
AE is attracting older gamers.
Sinon
407700701_25_a
Oh yeah, now that you mention it,
we look pretty close to our real
selves.
Leafa
407700701_24_a
No, he's probably that old. Asuka
Empire scans your body to create a
realistic representation of you.
Asuna
407700701_23_a
Er, assuming he's as old as his
avatar suggests, I guess.
Leafa
407700701_22_a
The old guy? Wow, talk about
being on the upper end of the
VR demographic.
Leafa

Ah, there's the head priest now!
Asuna

Yeah.

So this is where the shrine maiden
quest took place?
Sinon
407700701_16_a
Good point! Let's go!
Leafa
407700701_15_a
It might be worth bringing her
along, since we don't know
anything about AE's costume data.
Asuna
407700701_14_a
Something's definitely fishy about
that. Mind if I invite Sinonon
along to investigate?
Asuna
407700701_13_a
Why is Asuka Empire drawing on
real-world clothing data?
Leafa
407700701_12_a
But how? That design was made by
the head priest at my shrine...
Leafa
407700701_11_a
Wow, the entire outfit's the same!
Right down to the logo!
Leafa
407700701_10_a
There it is! Right there, on the
chest.
Asuna
407700701_9_a
Tfx
Yes! That was it!
Hang on, I'll find a picture.
Asuna
407700701_8_a
...a stylized little fox?
An Inari?
Leafa
407700701_7_a
Really? Was it, by chance...
Leafa
407700701_6_a
The in-game shrine maiden outfits
also had a little mark on them.
Asuna
407700701_5_a
I participated in a shrine maiden
quest with Alice in Asuka Empire.
Asuna

Y-Yeah. Why?
Leafa

Wait, there's a small crest on
the shrine maiden outfits?
Asuna
407700701_1_a
Why thank you for saying so!
I'll pass that along.
Shrine Employee
407700601_39_a
I like it! It's cute. I think it
will catch young customers'
attention.
Suguha
407700601_38_a
But he created the design and
thought it a shame not to use it.
Shrine Employee
407700601_37_a
No, it's more of a hobby,
I believe.
Shrine Employee
407700601_36_a
Is the head priest also a
designer?

407700601_35_a
The head priest of this shrine
designed that logo.
Shrine Employee
407700601_34_a
H<x
What do you mean?
Suguha
407700601_33_a
Ah, so you have noticed! That
is the playfulness of our dear
head priest shining through.
Shrine Employee
407700601_32_a
Oh yeah! I was curious about that
too. It looks like a little crest.
Our outfits have them too.
Shino
407700601_31_a
Some of the things you sell here
have a little logo-looking mark
on them.
Suguha
407700601_30_a
8rx
Huh, you know, I've been meaning
to ask about that.
Suguha
407700601_29_a
Wait, licensed goods...?
Shino
407700601_28_a
Heh heh, there's no need to
worry over the details. Here,
imagine they're licensed goods.
Shrine Employee
407700601_27_a
I mean, each one has some sort of
divine power in it, so if I just
keep that in mind...
Suguha
407700601_26_a
Are you all right?
Shrine Employee
407700601_25_a
pux
Y-Yeah, I'll manage... Somehow...
Suguha
407700601_24_a
Wow, this is a bigger selection
than I imagined. Think you can
remember it all, Suguha?
Shino
407700601_23_a
These are the items we sell here.
Shrine Employee
407700601_22_a
Okay, I'll do my best!
Suguha
407700601_21_a
Take it one item at a time and
you'll be fine.
Shrine Employee
407700601_20_a
Wow, it sounds like there's a lot
to keep track of. I hope I can
keep all that in my head!
Suguha
407700601_19_a
So do be on the lookout for that.
Shrine Employee
407700601_18_a
In addition, children sometimes
get lost and elderly worshipers
may require guidance.
Shrine Employee
407700601_17_a
We may ask you to clean when
you have the time.
Shrine Employee
407700601_16_a
But we can't very well tell them
not to tread on our grounds!
Shrine Employee
407700601_15_a
Sadly, yes. The more people we
have, the dirtier it gets. There's
no stopping that.
Shrine Employee
407700601_14_a
And I suppose the more worshipers
we have, the more cleaning we'll
need to do.
Shino
407700601_13_a
You must organize the storeroom,
keep goods flowing, and manage
the lines of customers.
Shrine Employee
407700601_12_a
The worshipers will come non-stop
for nearly four days. We must keep
charms on the shelves.
Shrine Employee
407700601_11_a
Fear not, I'll teach you. But know
that this job is about more than
sitting and taking money!
Shrine Employee
407700601_10_a
I've had a little experience with
one in VR, but...
Suguha
407700601_9_a
I have experience working a
register. That won't be a problem.
Shino
407700601_8_a
You shall primarily be responsible
for selling charms and amulets,
as well as votive pictures.
Shrine Employee
407700601_7_a
Yes!
Suguha
407700601_6_a
Now, allow me to explain your
duties as shrine maidens.
Shrine Employee

Shino & Suguha
407700501_22_a
The pleasure is all mine.
I'll warn you that this is a busy
time of year. Are you ready?
Shrine Employee
407700501_21_a
Indeed I am. It is a pleasure to
meet you.
Shino
407700501_20_a
So you must be Suguha Kirigaya,
and you must be Shino Asada.
Shrine Employee
407700501_19_a
Yes, we are. Er, well, I'm on a
work-study assignment.
Suguha
407700501_18_a
Ah, you must be our new
assistants.
Shrine Employee
407700501_17_a
Yeah, it's pretty famous, even
in Kawagoe.
Suguha

Shino

Oh, yeah! Tons!

I'm not mad at you or Sinonon,

Asuna

Yeah, he did. He said you were
pretty upset...
Leafa
407700501_5_a
Oh, don't worry about it.
Didn't Kirito tell you we talked?
Asuna
407700501_4_a
I should've told you I was working
with Sinon.

I do not like the look of those
eyes...
Kirito

sounds like you've committed that
image to memory!
Asuna
407700401_26_a
Totally. But...
Asuna
407700401_25_a
Y-Yeah! It was a total accident.
Kirito

It was an accident! You
poked your head in while
Sinonon was changing.

I had to make sure it fit, okay?!
I can't work in an outfit that
doesn't fit!
Shino

Okay, so... Why are you dressed
like a shrine maiden, anyway?
Kazuto
407700401_14_a

Whatever...
Shino
407700401_13_a
p%x
Yeah, so she wouldn't find out
about it through some rumor.
Suguha
407700401_12_a
So that's why you wanted to tell
Asuna yourself.
Shino
407700401_11_a

Shino's a friend! And we're
going to work together!

Shino
407700401_8_a
But you didn't say it was Shino!
Kazuto
407700401_7_a
I told you I was having a friend
over tonight.

Asuna
407700201_22_a
N-Nope. Nothing!
Kirito
407700201_21_a
So nothing happened while she
was there?
Asuna
407700201_20_a
R-Right...
Kirito
407700201_19_a
XAx
I'm sure you're right. She was
there as Suguha's friend. That's
all.
Asuna
407700201_18_a
She just forgot to bring it up.
She wasn't hiding it from you.
At least, I don't think she was...
Kirito
407700201_17_a
And Sinonon didn't even tell me...
Asuna
407700201_16_a
lCx
Uh-huh...
Asuna
407700201_15_a
XFx
Which means there are a lot of
part-time shrine maiden jobs
around that time.
Kirito
407700201_14_a
Yeah. We live near a bunch of
shrines and temples. Not as many
as AE has, but a good amount.
Kirito
407700201_13_a
dEx
,Fx
So she only stayed there while
she was working at the shrine?
Asuna
407700201_12_a
All I knew is that Sugu was having
a friend over.
Kirito
407700201_11_a
F-For the record, I didn't hear
about this until after it
happened, okay?
Kirito
407700201_10_a
dGx
Sh-She what?!
Asuna
407700201_9_a
Yeah. She stayed at my house
for a couple of days.
Kirito
407700201_8_a
DIx
Oh, cool! But...doesn't Sinon
live in Tokyo?
Asuna
407700201_7_a
Yeah. It was part of her school's
work-study program. Sinon was
the one working part-time.
Kirito
407700201_6_a
As a part-time job? But Leafa's
still in middle school!
Asuna
407700201_5_a
No, no, in real life. You know,
how they hire extras around
New Year's.
Kirito

too.
Kirito
407700201_1_a
PMx
Yeah?
Asuna
407700101_35_a
Oh! Speaking of the shrine maiden
thing...
Kirito
407700101_34_a
$Ox
Heh, I think that says more about
Alice's level of devotion than
anything.
Asuna
407700101_33_a
Ha ha, wow, that's harsh.
I guess that's how he was
before he lost his memory.
Kirito
407700101_32_a
She said Eugeo's not devout enough
to be moved.
Asuna
407700101_31_a
lPx
When I mentioned that deities
were enshrined there, Alice made
a comment.
Asuna
407700101_30_a
Really? Huh. I wonder what makes
them so different...
Kirito
407700101_29_a
I took Eugeo to the shrines too,
but it didn't move him like it
moved Alice.
Asuna
407700101_28_a
So, what about Eugeo?
Kirito
407700101_27_a
You got it.
Asuna
407700101_26_a
you ended up getting involved
with the shrine maiden event?
Kirito
407700101_25_a
So that's how it started?
Once you were at the shrines,
Kirito
407700101_24_a
hVx
She's been feeling pretty terrible
lately, so I figured slowing down
a bit might do her some good.
Asuna
407700101_23_a
XVx
Precisely. And wouldn't you know,
she said she felt incredibly
comfortable. My hunch was right!
Asuna
407700101_22_a
Right, Asuka Empire's full of
shrines and temples, given its
Japanese theme.
Kirito
407700101_21_a
So I decided to take her to the
shrine area.
Asuna
407700101_20_a
She said she felt incredibly at
peace, like something had calmed
her from within.
Asuna
407700101_19_a
lXx
Really? Like what?
Kirito
407700101_18_a
Alice said she felt something
the last time we were in AE.
Asuna
407700101_17_a
Well, it's funny you should say
that...
Asuna
407700101_16_a
Man, I just can't picture
Alice doing all that.
Kirito
407700101_15_a
Yep!
Asuna
407700101_14_a
0[x
You mean like girls doing a part-
time job when worshipers come for
the first prayers of the new year?
Kirito
407700101_13_a
Yeah, we both went. Alice even
did a New Year's shrine maiden
event.
Asuna
407700101_12_a
Wow. She liked it that much, huh?
Kirito
407700101_11_a
D]x
Alice actually went back into
Asuka Empire after that.
Asuna
407700101_10_a
They're doing much better.
Asuna
407700101_9_a
You know, you're right.
How are they feeling?
Kirito
407700101_8_a
I haven't seen you since we played
Asuka Empire with Alice and Eugeo
and recovered that Divine Object.
Asuna
407700101_7_a
Well, if memory serves...
Asuna
407700101_6_a
I didn't even have time to dive
into VR that much.
Kirito
407700101_5_a
Yeah, I know. Our schedules didn't
really line up over the New Year's
break.

I was wrong, and I'm sorry...

I can't believe you said you'd
help us, and then turned traitor!
You're the absolute WORST!!

Ugh, are you a complete moron,
or just a TOTAL JERK?!

Ha ha, yeah!
Hey girls! Over here!
Silica
407601101_30_a
Well, speak of the Asuna, and she
doth appear.
Liz
407601101_29_a
Heeey! We're baaack!
???
407601101_28_a
I know! I bet we'll be finished by
the time everybody gets back from
dragon hunting!
Silica
407601101_27_a
Yeah! The town's almost rebuilt,
and it looks delicious!

That came out pretty well, huh?
Rechka
407601101_23_a
Eep!! Y-Yes, ma'ams...
Aha. Ha ha...
Klein
407601101_22_a
You're not going ANYWHERE, mister!
Asuna & Yuuki
407601101_21_a
I'm gonna go log out now, okay?
Bye!
Klein
407601101_20_a
Eep! Uhh...
So... I just remembered I had
urgent business anywhere but here.
Klein
407601101_19_a
Yuuki
407601101_18_a
Ahaha... I bet Liz'll be totally
furious...
Asuna
407601101_17_a
We won't, but I can't make any
promises that Liz won't boil you
alive when she hears about this.
Yuuki
407601101_16_a
Yuuki
407601101_15_a
Whoa, relax, Klein...
We're not going to hurt you...
Asuna
407601101_14_a
But...I can take whatever you can
dish out! Burn me, cut me, torture
me, I won't break!!
Klein
407601101_13_a
D-Damn, they got us...
Klein
407601101_12_a
Yuuki
407601101_11_a
It's down to just the two of you
now. What're you going to do,
Klein?
Asuna
407601101_10_a
Yuuki
407601101_9_a
Annnd that finishes that.
Asuna
407601101_8_a
Eeyaaagh!!
Klein
407601101_7_a
Klein
407601101_6_a
Grnnk!!
Salamander Guy

Take that!!
Yuuki

Asuna

Salamander Guy
407601001_38_a
Yeah! Bring it on!
Klein
407601001_37_a
Yuuki
407601001_36_a
So I hope you're ready for a
fight!!
Asuna
407601001_35_a
Y-Yeah, I guess...
Klein, listen up!
We're not backing down!
Asuna
407601001_34_a
Fighting over differing viewpoints
and taking sides is part of the
fun of it.
Girl
407601001_33_a
We're not backing down here.
Besides, ALO is all about PvP.
Girl
407601001_32_a
Yuuki
407601001_31_a
Asuna
407601001_30_a
Asuna... Can we kill this guy
already?
Girl
407601001_29_a
This guy! This guy here, he's a
man among men! Fighting for
what he believes in!
Klein
407601001_28_a
Salamander Guy
407601001_27_a
I know that, but...
I'm sorry! I can't back down!
Klein
407601001_26_a
Yuuki
407601001_25_a
That guy's a bad person! He
destroyed the town! And we came
here to fight dragons, right?!
Asuna
407601001_24_a
O-Oh yeah, you're right!
Klein! Be rational here!
Asuna
407601001_23_a
This isn't the time to analyze
Klein, Asuna!
Yuuki
407601001_22_a
But I guess he has a thing for
guy NPCs too...?
Asuna
407601001_21_a
Klein's always been weirdly
sympathetic towards NPCs, but I
thought it was only with girls...
Asuna
407601001_20_a
Ugh, Klein! You're just being a
jerk now!
Yuuki
407601001_19_a
Yuuki
407601001_18_a
Hey, Klein...
Asuna
407601001_17_a
So that's why I'm gonna side with
the dragons and this NPC on this
one!
Klein
407601001_16_a
Only the cool and popular guys
ever get chocolate on Valentine's
Day! It sucks, and I hate it too!
Klein
407601001_15_a
Salamander Guy
407601001_14_a
Y-Yeah, I know that!
But still, he's moved me!
Klein
407601001_13_a
Yuuki
407601001_12_a
Klein! He's the bad guy here! He's
responsible for this whole mess!
Asuna
407601001_11_a
K-Klein?! What do you think you're
doing?!
Yuuki
407601001_9_a
T8y
Asuna
407601001_10_a
I'm on your side here, bro!
Klein
407601001_8_a
Salamander Guy
407601001_7_a
No, seriously! I totally get where
you're coming from! It sucks not
getting chocolate!
Klein
407601001_6_a
Yuuki
407601001_5_a
Huh?! Wait... No... Nooo!!
Asuna
407601001_4_a
Salamander Guy
407601001_3_a
DUUUDE!
I get you!!
???
407601001_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
I'm here for all the guys who
don't get chocolate on Valentine's
Day! I'm their righteous wrath!
Salamander Guy
407601001_1_a
Seems that way...
Asuna
407600901_54_a
So what you're saying is you're
sad no one's given you chocolate?
Yuuki
407600901_53_a
Yuuki
407600901_52_a
Uh...
Asuna
407600901_51_a
But I've never EVER once gotten
chocolate in ALL my life! You know
how that makes me feel?! BAD!!
Salamander Guy
407600901_50_a
You give Valentine's Day chocolate
to your boyfriends and girlfriends
and friends friends!
Salamander Guy
407600901_49_a
Because you idiot girls are having
sooo much fun making chocolate,
and it pisses me off!
Salamander Guy
407600901_48_a
Why?! WHY?!
Salamander Guy
407600901_47_a
Yuuki
407600901_46_a
Why are you trying to destroy
our town?!
Asuna
407600901_45_a
xCy
Asuna
407600901_44_a
That NPC's the bad guy! Get him!
Yuuki
407600901_43_a
And I'm gonna do it again too!
I'll raze that town until there's
only chocolate ashes left!
Salamander Guy
407600901_42_a
I was the one who set the dragons
on your dumb town!
Salamander Guy
407600901_41_a
Yuuki
407600901_40_a
And in the middle of them is...
a Salamander guy?
Asuna
407600901_39_a
Graaawr!!
Dragons
407600901_38_a
Look, Asuna!
A whole swarm of dragons!
Yuuki
407600901_37_a
What the...?!
Asuna
407600901_36_a
That's far enough, losers!
???
407600901_35_a
I can't believe Klein would ever
willingly choose to not spend time
with girls...
Asuna
407600901_34_a
Maybe he was just too
uncomfortable being the only
guy here and went home?
Yuuki
407600901_33_a
I don't know.
He disappeared a little while ago.
Yuuki
407600901_32_a
Hold on...
Where's Klein?
Asuna
407600901_31_a
You got it!!
Players
407600901_30_a
Yeah... Well, let's just be
careful up here, okay, girls?
Asuna
407600901_29_a
These are fire dragons, and they
live near the mouth of a volcano.
No wonder it's hot.
Yuuki
407600901_28_a
Yuuki
407600901_27_a
bg_event_fire_cave
It's so hot around here...
Asuna
407600901_26_a
Silica
407600901_25_a
Rechka
407600901_24_a
Hehe, I'm 100% with you!
Liz
407600901_23_a
What?! Okay, we really need to get
this town rebuilt ASAP! I want my
chocolate!
Silica
407600901_22_a
Ah, cool. But that means we can't
make that chocolate until we
rebuild the patisserie, right?
Liz
407600901_21_a
Because they upped the reality of
the cooking process, the food
was way tastier.
Rechka
407600901_20_a
Remember that cooking battle we
had?
Rechka
407600901_19_a
You bet! I heard that the
chocolate-making process
is really realistic now.
Rechka
407600901_18_a
It's a shop that makes pastries
and sweets. So, I take it this
chocolate's special somehow?
Liz
407600901_17_a
What's a patisserie?
It sounds French.
Silica
407600901_16_a
Special chocolate? I heard you can
only make that in the town's
patisserie.
Rechka
407600901_15_a
But we haven't had to make any for
these houses yet, so I guess we
don't need it?
Liz
407600901_14_a
Ahh, good point.
I almost forgot about that...
Liz
407600901_13_a
Well, kinda... There's that
special chocolate we heard
about, right?
Silica
407600901_12_a
Seems so, yeah. Why? Did you
expect otherwise?
Liz
407600901_11_a
I'm just glad these houses don't
require special skills to build.
It's just standard ALO cooking.
Silica
407600901_9_a
Liz
407600901_10_a
Thanks to your flawless prep.
You and Silica made this a
piece of cake.
Rechka
407600901_8_a
Silica
407600901_7_a
Rechka
407600901_6_a
Reporting in!
We're making good progress.
Liz
407600901_5_a
The town's houses may be covered
in chocolate, but they're cookies
at the core. We'll need tons!
Rechka
407600901_4_a
Yes, ma'am!
Girl
407600901_3_a
We're mass-baking cookies
over there now.
Rechka
407600901_2_a
bg_event_broken_valentine_town
Now, bring this to the edge of
town, okay?
Rechka
407600901_1_a
This guy...
Klein
407600801_27_a
Maybe I should make a whole army
of my fellow bachelors to really
punish those girls!
Salamander Guy
407600801_26_a
And I bet there are tons of guys
out there just like me! They're
happy I ruined this dumb holiday!
Salamander Guy
407600801_25_a
Wait, what...?!
Klein
407600801_24_a
And now I've gotten my revenge!
Muhaha!
Salamander Guy
407600801_23_a
For decades I've been so unpopular
no girl has given me chocolate...
Salamander Guy
407600801_22_a
This is pretty twisted, even for
an auto-generated quest.
Klein
407600801_21_a
Wow, that's messed up...
Klein
407600801_20_a
Ha ha ha! That stupid chocolate
town and those stupid girls
deserved it!
Salamander Guy
407600801_19_a
I guess he must've done it.
But those dragons were
definitely not tamed, just angry.
Klein
407600801_18_a
From that pathetic confession,
it sounds like he's the guy who
started this whole mess.
Klein
407600801_17_a
Wow, he's a jerk...
I guess he's an NPC?
Klein
407600801_16_a
Hah! It doesn't matter if I'm
not popular with the ladies!
Valentine's Day is OVER!
Salamander Guy
407600801_15_a
I ruined their dumb holiday anyway
after I pissed off those dragons
and made them attack town!
Salamander Guy
407600801_14_a
W-Wait, no! Who cares about
Valentine's Day?!
Salamander Guy
407600801_13_a
Why does nobody love me?!
I want chocolate too!!
Salamander Guy
407600801_12_a
They got all super happy and made
all that chocolate, but nooo!
None for me! BAH!
Salamander Guy
407600801_11_a
I hate those stupid girls!
Salamander Guy
407600801_9_a
Klein
407600801_10_a
Hmm? I think I just heard someone
behind that rock.
Klein
407600801_8_a
sigh
...
???
407600801_7_a
Wh-Where am I?! I zone out for a
second, and suddenly Asuna and
the rest are nowhere to be seen!
Klein
407600801_6_a
Wait a sec...?!
Klein
407600801_5_a
If only K-dawg were here. At least
then I'd have someone to talk to.
Klein
407600801_4_a
And I'm the only guy here, so I
thought I'd be in bachelor heaven,
but I just feel out of place...
Klein
407600801_3_a
These girls are vicious in their
quest for chocolate vengeance.
It's actually kinda scary...
Klein
407600801_2_a
bg_02_forest
Man... I'm seriously just a third
wheel here. Battle's over again,
and I did nothing. Nothing!
Klein
407600801_1_a
Yeah, thought as much...
sigh
I'll just go wait in
the corner.
Klein
407600701_38_a
Yuuki
407600701_37_a
Hold on please, Klein. I'll get
to you after I finish here.
Asuna
407600701_36_a
Is there literally anything for me
to do here?
Klein
407600701_35_a
L0y
Umm... Asuna? Yuuki?
Klein
407600701_34_a
Yuuki
407600701_33_a
Hehe, glad you agree!
Asuna
407600701_32_a
Oh, I like that! It's magic DPS
tactics, but it'll be perfect for
these things.
Girl
407600701_31_a
So I've been thinking I want to
change our formation like...this.
What do you say?
Asuna
407600701_30_a
Yeah. You get distracted by the
wave of scary flame, only to get
chomped down on.
Yuuki
407600701_29_a
We're all focusing on dodging
their fire breath, but their teeth
and claws do more damage.
Asuna
407600701_28_a
Yuuki
407600701_27_a
Okay, people, while we're healing
up for the next group of dragons,
I've got something to say.
Asuna
407600701_26_a
Dude... I didn't even get a chance
to do anything...
Klein
407600701_25_a
...
Klein
407600701_24_a
45y
Asuna
407600701_23_a
Yeah!
Yuuki
407600701_22_a
,"y
We share the same, clear goal.
That makes it easy to focus.
Asuna
407600701_21_a
Hehe... Everyone's all pumped
up and working together like
clockwork!
Yuuki
407600701_20_a
Yes, ma'am!
Girl
407600701_19_a
Their nests are still up ahead.
We'll need to be careful and
stay sharp.
Asuna
407600701_18_a
It's too early to celebrate.
That was just the first group.
Asuna
407600701_17_a
Yuuki
407600701_16_a
Asuna
407600701_15_a

Hehe, sounds like fun. Well, let's
make sure there's a town waiting
for them when they get back!
Rechka
407600601_25_a
And let me tell you, those girls
are riled up and ready to kill.
I feel bad for those dragons.
Liz
407600601_24_a
She's in charge of the
dragon-hunting expedition.
Liz
407600601_23_a
So... Where's Asuna, anyway?
Rechka
407600601_22_a
Hehe, I'm looking forward to
seeing what you can do!
Liz
407600601_21_a
But if it's COOKING a house,
I'll definitely be up to the
challenge!
Rechka
407600601_20_a
I've never built a house before,
so I didn't think I'd be much
help...
Rechka
407600601_19_a
Ha ha, how many times do I have to
tell you, I'm not her teacher!
Rechka
407600601_18_a
Having an elite chef like you on
our side is going to help a lot!
Asuna's cooking teacher, aw yeah!

skills have been assembled!

Phew... I think we'll just have
enough people to get this done.
Liz
407600601_7_a
Sure, got it!
Female Player C
407600601_6_a
I've marked down what I'd like you
to gather on this list. Is that
okay?
Liz
407600601_5_a
First, we need people to go gather
the materials... Er, ingredients
we need to rebuild these houses.
Liz
407600601_4_a
So, what do you need us to do?
Female Player C
407600601_3_a
Well, we're happy to help.
We want to make chocolate too!
Female Player C

One focuses on fixing the town,
the other on hunting down dragons.

us!

I'll show you the power and skill
of the Salamander's ace swordsman!
Klein

You are?! I'm wanted?!
W-Well, in that case, yeah!
You can count on me, ladies!

Klein

GET BACK HERE, KLEIN!
You're helping us, and
that's final!

Uhh, cool. Have fun with that.
See ya around.
Klein
407600401_34_a

Then we have two goals:
restore the town, and defeat
the dragons.
Asuna
407600401_29_a
Don't forget that the dragons are
still out there. They could come
back at any time.
Silica

So we need a way to fix this town,
right?
Yuuki
407600401_25_a
Yeah, that's a good point.
Asuna
407600401_24_a
I've never met an event that
didn't have a solution. There's
gotta be a way to fix this.

407600401_23_a
Well, if this IS an event, that
makes things simple.

But then again, there's also a
chance this is some sort of
holiday event.
Klein

The NPCs have to fix them one by
one, and I'm guessing they just
can't keep up.
Klein
407600401_8_a
Then why aren't these buildings
fixing themselves?
Liz
407600401_7_a
Okay, that makes sense. Otherwise,
those dragons wouldn't have been
able to get in here.
Asuna
407600401_6_a
So in other words, monsters have
free run of the place.
Klein
407600401_5_a
They built a special Valentine's
Day town here, but the game still
treats it as a wilderness field.

What's going on here, Klein?
Why are dragons appearing in
the middle of town?!
Liz
407600301_40_a
Figures... They show up, smash the
place up, then fly away once
they're satisfied...
Klein
407600301_39_a
We beat back some of them, but
most of them just flew away after
enough time passed.
Asuna

rampaging over here?!

Yuuki

Pina
407501201_15_a
Me too. Eat mochi, fight mochi,
mochi, mochi, mochi! I'm a little
sick of it now.
Silica
407501201_14_a
For sure. At any rate, I think I'm
gonna lay off the mochi for a
bit...
Kirito
407501201_13_a
Kirito
407501201_12_a
That ought to give you a leg up
in other VRMMOs too. At least,
I hope it helps!
Leafa
407501201_11_a
And I learned how to fight in a
raid, to boot! That was fun.
Player F
407501201_9_a
Pina
407501201_10_a
Heh, you're very welcome! I'm glad
the mochi-making competition had
a happy ending.
Silica
407501201_8_a
Thanks, guys! We wouldn't have
completed that quest without you.

Pina
407501201_5_a
Yep. Man, that felt really cool!
I'd never done a raid battle in
AE before.
Yuuki
407501201_4_a
Nice one! That was the last of
them.
Leafa
407501201_3_a
GRRRRRGHHH!

HYAAAAH!
Kirito
407501201_1_a
Oh, right! That too!
Kirito
407501101_33_a
Don't forget the mochi monster!
Leafa
407501101_32_a
Leafa
407501101_31_a
Okay, I think we're set.
Let's kill some ogres!
Kirito
407501101_30_a
Pina
407501101_29_a
YEAH!
Players
407501101_28_a
Swords and spears, charge with me
on my command!
Yuuki

Yuuki
407501101_26_a
Pina
407501101_25_a
Shamans and Warrior Monks!
Stay to the sides and heal our
fighters!
Silica

Archery unit's in place!
Leafa
407501101_23_a
Leafa
407501101_22_a
Here we go! Warriors, to the front
lines!
Kirito
407501101_21_a
Graaaaagh!
Ogre
407501101_20_a
Alright, leave it to me!
Kirito
407501101_19_a
I got some good mochi out of this!
Running home screaming won't make
for a story worth telling!
Player G
407501101_18_a
Yeah, I don't want this to end on
a downer!
Player G
407501101_17_a
Okay then. Give us some roles!
Player F
407501101_16_a
Get that down and the routine
won't change much from game
to game.
Kirito
407501101_15_a
The key to a raid battle is
knowing your role and
executing it well!
Kirito
407501101_14_a
Yuuki
407501101_13_a
Leafa
407501101_12_a
Ha ha, I don't know about that,
but okay...
Silica
407501101_11_a
Not in AE. We're newbies here.
But we'll get used to it soon
enough.
Kirito
407501101_10_a
He's got a point. Have you guys
fought in raids before?
Player E
407501101_9_a
We can't run away from this fight,
and fighting through this battle
will help us fight those to come!
Kirito
407501101_8_a
Maybe this sudden quest is a trial
run for large-scale battles that
the admins came up with.
Kirito
407501101_7_a
Most of the game's quests can be
done by one person or a small
group.
Player G
407501101_6_a
We've never really needed to,
I guess.
Player G
407501101_5_a
Asuka Empire has raid battles?
I've never done one before.
Player F
407501101_4_a
I'm going to teach you all how to
get into formation for a raid
battle.
Kirito
407501101_3_a
Kirito
407501101_2_a

What was the point of leading us
here?
Player E

Go for it!
Kirito
407501001_36_a
Silica
407501001_35_a
Pina
407501001_34_a
I'll stay out of sight and follow
you to make sure you're all good!
Yuuki
407501001_33_a
Leafa
407501001_32_a
Great! Let's get the players'
attention and start leading
them that way!
Kirito
407501001_31_a
Pina
407501001_30_a
It's still within the battle area,
though, so we can't hide there
for long!
Yuuki
407501001_29_a
Silica
407501001_28_a
Pina
407501001_27_a
There's a courtyard through that
alley!
Yuuki
407501001_26_a
Yeah, that sounds like our only
option. Yuuki, is there somewhere
we can gather everyone together?
Kirito
407501001_25_a
We'll just have to teach them how
to fight a raid battle on the fly!
Leafa
407501001_24_a
Leafa
407501001_23_a
I know...
Kirito
407501001_22_a
Yuuki
407501001_21_a
Pina
407501001_20_a
What do we do? I don't think we
can handle them all on our own!

AHHHHHH!

GRAAARRRR!
Ogre
407501001_16_a
Leafa
407501001_15_a
Yeah, come to think of it, the
players we met did say that AE
plays pretty differently.
Kirito
407501001_14_a
Pina
407501001_13_a
There's a lot of PvP, and people
like to split off and explore the
rich setting for themselves.
Yuuki
407501001_12_a
Ah yeah, teamwork is one of the
weak points in the AE player base.
Yuuki
407501001_11_a
Pina
407501001_9_a
I don't know... Staying to fight
is important, but no one's
working together!
Silica
407501001_8_a
Yuuki
407501001_10_a
Kirito
407501001_7_a
Do AE players not know how to
fight as a team?
Leafa
407501001_6_a
We need healers, not shields!
Someone's gotta keep us alive!
Player G
407501001_5_a
No, stay and fight! Here, you can
be my human shield!
Player F
407501001_4_a
Run for your liiiiife!

It's no use! They're too panicked.
Kirito
407500901_63_a
HELP! There's no way we can
beat them all!
Players
407500901_62_a
We need to get into a raid
formation if we're gonna take
all of these enemies on!
Kirito
407500901_61_a
I see that. Everyone, form up!
Kirito
407500901_60_a
Look! It says we've triggered an
event battle!

The mochi's moving too!

Look out! The ogres are going
nuts!
Player C
407500901_53_a
GYYYYAAAAAAAGGGGGHHH!
Ogre
407500901_52_a
And now they're turning this
mochi monstrosity loose on us!
Yuuki
407500901_51_a
The mochi making was just for
show. They wanted to attract a
crowd!
Yuuki
407500901_50_a
They were filling the mochi with
some sort of power that turned
it into a monster!
Yuuki
407500901_49_a
Yuuki

Oh man, the pile's getting

Mochi's best when it's fresh, too.
It'll dry out if they don't put it
away soon...
Kirito
407500901_23_a
Pina
407500901_22_a
Everyone got tired of eating mochi
and now it's just piling up!

Oh no, look!

Yeah, it's getting a little weird,
huh? This is probably their job,
but their dedication is...slavish.
Yuuki
407500901_17_a
How much mochi are they gonna
make, anyway?
Leafa
407500901_16_a
A lot of players have moved on,
but these two are still going at
it.

I know what you mean!

I can't help it! I have a salty
one, so then I want a sweet one.
That's how they get you!
Leafa
407500901_5_a
Of course not. You ate too much...
Kirito
407500901_4_a
I don't think I can look at
another mochi...
Leafa

Sounds good!

Ha ha, then let's dig into this
mochi buffet!
Kirito
407500801_65_a

Now that I'm looking at it,
I think my appetite just came
back!

Yuuki
407500801_61_a
Oh my gosh, that last one makes it
sound like dessert!
Silica
407500801_60_a
Roasted soybean flour! Cheese!
Fermented soybeans! Black sesame
seed paste and jam, even!!
Leafa
407500801_59_a

Wow, you're right!
Look at all that!
Leafa
407500801_57_a

I bet you could create a lot of
different flavor combinations!
Yuuki

Silica
407500801_54_a
Pina
407500801_53_a
I'm not saying you have to, but
they've got a lot of toppings
laid out here.
Yuuki
407500801_52_a
Leafa
407500801_51_a

Oh yeah? I guess that makes sense.
One mochi ball has as much rice
as one bowl before it's pounded.
Kirito
407500801_50_a
Pina
407500801_49_a
Yuuki
407500801_48_a
I, um, might have overdone it on
mochi earlier... I'm not really
hungry.
Silica
407500801_47_a
Yeah, let's!
Leafa
407500801_46_a
Maybe we should try some.
Kirito

This mochi is amazing!
Give us more!!

Heh. Sounds like I've piqued your

Yuuki

A secret job in a class of its

Kirito
407500801_35_a
Silica
407500801_34_a
Pina
407500801_33_a
Right, but the Monster job class
is supposedly different from those
other classes too.
Yuuki
407500801_32_a

Yeah, I know there are special
job classes you can unlock.
Kirito
407500801_30_a
Pina
407500801_29_a
Interesting!
Silica

People have been saying there's a
way to unlock the Monster job

I'm pretty sure you can't,

I don't remember seeing that
option on the job menu.
Kirito

Wait... People can't play as
monsters, can they?
Kirito

Well, it's a little weird to see
here in Kiyomihara, but Ayakashi

Not at all.

Is this not weird in AE?
To just have demons chilling
in the street?
Leafa

Everyone's just lining up like
this isn't weird...

Yes, it feels quite different in

As long as they've played a VRMMO
before, I mean.
Kirito
407500701_19_a
Agreed. Which means that even
total newbies have a shot.
Kirito
407500701_18_a
That ought to make it easy for
us to make the transition to AE!
Leafa

The basic actions in this game
feel a lot like ALO, huh?

Yeah, I suppose you're right!
Okay, I'm ready to try turning
the mochi!
Silica
407500601_35_a
Everyone has to know what they're
doing and stay in sync in order
to succeed.
Yuuki
407500601_34_a
There's so much to consider. You
have to know when to pour the
hot water, when to turn it...
Yuuki
407500601_33_a
No way! I've never made mochi here
before, so we're on a level
playing field!
Yuuki

Not only are you stronger and
faster, but you've also played
AE before!

better than me.

Hyah! Hah!
Silica
407500601_25_a
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Player A
407500601_24_a
I see what you're after. Let us
know if there's something we
can do to show you our skills.
Kirito
407500601_23_a
The game gets harder as more and
more players aim to be the best.
Kirito
407500601_22_a
That's just how most MMOs work.
Kirito
407500601_21_a
The admins do their best to scale
the difficulty to a given player's
abilities.
Kirito
407500601_20_a
<>z
Huh... I mean, I thought the
enemies were a little easy,
but that was the tutorial...
Leafa
407500601_19_a
But they say there's not a lot
of depth to it, unlike ALO and
GGO.
Player A
407500601_18_a
Lots of people like to play it for
the atmosphere, you know?
Player A
407500601_17_a
Eh, not really. It's just got its
quirks, like any other Japanese
game.
Player A
407500601_16_a
Are you trying to say that Asuka
Empire is pretty restrictive when
it comes to gameplay?
Kirito
407500601_15_a
Uh, sure. I'll try...
Kirito
407500601_14_a
I hope you bring something fresh
to AE from whatever game you
came from!
Player A
407500601_13_a
Ahh, transfers, eh? Well, strap
in. The engine's the same, but
the gameplay is way different.
Player A
407500601_12_a
Uh, yeah, pretty much.
Kirito
407500601_11_a
Did you convert all your stuff
over from another VRMMO?
Player B
407500601_10_a
Are you guys noobs?
Nah, you couldn't be. Your
moves are too clean.
Player B
407500601_9_a
You think so? I didn't think it
looked THAT good...
Kirito
407500601_8_a
It looked almost acrobatic!

Wow, you guys were incredible!

Ready to give this a try, Silica?
Yuuki

Ha ha! Yeah, you could say that.
And we're not about to let them
steal the show!
Yuuki

Heh heh, I guess so. Wow, mochi
making is like playing a rhythm

happened.

something tasty to eat! That'll

Kirito

Good talk!
Agil
407401201_20_a
But w-w-wait!
Kirito
407401201_19_a
Be sure to tell Rain and Sinon
and the gang, okay?
Agil
407401201_18_a
B-But...!
Kirito
407401201_17_a
Heroes who save lives deserve to
be celebrated! Just be grateful.
Agil
407401201_16_a
For one, it's not a bad thing.
For two, this is how it works.
Agil
407401201_15_a
Hey, wait a minute!
What if we don't want to?
We don't like all the attention!
Kirito
407401201_14_a
And once the party kicks off again,
you'll all be guests of honor, so
get pumped up!
Agil
407401201_13_a
The what?!
Kirito
407401201_12_a
Oh, and by the way, you're all
going to be up on stage giving
the toast that restarts the party.
Agil
407401201_11_a
Well, on the other hand, we saw
our one chance to make a mark.
Kirito
407401201_10_a
You, Rain, Yuuki, Alicia's guards,
and Sinon's crew. All heroes.
Agil
407401201_9_a
I kept hearing them call you guys
heroes, too.
Agil
407401201_8_a
Even after that battle? Heh, this
group really has some stamina.
Kirito
407401201_7_a
Eh, we can replace all of that.
Everyone actually seems pretty
excited about redoing the party.
Agil
407401201_6_a
It wasn't pretty, but it worked.
It's a shame we lost all the food,
though.
Kirito
407401201_5_a
You three really saved us there.
Hell, I can't believe the three of
you took out all those monsters.
Agil
407401201_4_a
You too, Agil.

Agil

Exactly!
Kirito
407401101_34_a
Nooow I get it! Get them all in
one place so we can wreck their
faces!
Yuuki
407401101_33_a
Makes sense! All of us have pretty
powerful sword skills as well.
Rain
407401101_32_a
The kind that rounds the monsters
up for easy killing!
Kirito
407401101_31_a
Huh? What kind of plan is that?
Yuuki
407401101_30_a
Quick, guys. Gather all the food
and ingredients in one place!
Kirito
407401101_29_a
Is that it? Then let's use that to
our advantage.
Kirito
407401101_28_a
Ah, that must be why there are so
many of them.
Rain
407401101_27_a
They're after all our party food!
They must have smelled it and
come running.
Yuuki
407401101_26_a
How are they different?
Kirito
407401101_25_a
They're also not ordinary
monsters, so watch out!
Yuuki
407401101_24_a
In their defense, these monsters
rained on their parade.
Yuuki
407401101_23_a
Aren't there any players left who
can actually fight?
Rain

Kirito

number of players around.
Rain

Yuuki
407401101_19_a
You okay, Yuuki?
Kirito
407401101_18_a
Kirito! Rain!
Yuuki
407401101_17_a
So how do you explain all this?
Rain
407401101_16_a
Yeah, that's why he wanted to
have the gift swap here.
Kirito
407401101_15_a
I thought Agil said enemy spawns
were pretty rare here...
Rain
407401101_14_a
These enemies are pretty intense.
Rain

even more out of place in the end.
Kirito

Say something, Kirito!
This is getting depressing!
Sinon
407400901_35_a
...
Kirito
407400901_34_a
I got a magic thing that makes
shaved ice. Not that I need it
at this time of year.
Rain
407400901_33_a
I don't know why anyone would
ever want that, though...
Sinon
407400901_32_a
I got an umbrella that apparently
rains on you from the inside
when you open it...
Sinon
407400901_31_a
I got glasses that give you a
funny face when you equip them.
Kirito
407400901_30_a
If you say so. So, what'd
everybody get in return?
Kirito
407400901_29_a
Eh, it happens. Don't worry about
it. I'm fine.
Rain
407400901_28_a
That's just rude!
Sinon
407400901_27_a
What?! Who says that at a gift
swap?!
Kirito
407400901_26_a
She was pretty happy with it.
Said she could sell it for a lot
of money...
Rain
407400901_25_a
Sinon
407400901_24_a
Oh, a woman got my present.
Rain
407400901_23_a
What did the person who got your
gift say, Rain?
Kirito
407400901_22_a
Heh...
Rain
407400901_21_a
What? You thought I'd fall for
his obvious ploy to talk to me?
It's the oldest trick in the book.
Sinon
407400901_20_a
Aw, that's a shame.
Rain
407400901_19_a
I shot him down, of course.
Sinon
407400901_18_a
Well, that's a Christmas party
for you.
Rain
407400901_17_a
He what?!
Kirito
407400901_15_a
Rain
407400901_16_a

excuse to hit on me.
Sinon

Oh yeah?
Rain

The player who got my gift found
me.

Something wrong, Sinon?
Rain

I think I'd just die if I went
to a club in real life.
Sinon

getting off easy, having only
experienced this virtual club.

407201201_46_a
Eugeo
407201201_45_a
So...this is one of the rules
of this world...
Alice
407201201_44_a
z66
This was decided long ago, when
the Divine Objects were first
forged...
Urdr
407201201_43_a
z66
I am eternally grateful to you.
However, there is no changing
your sad fate.
Urdr
407201201_42_a
Alice
407201201_41_a
I don't want to have my memory
erased! Is there nothing we can
do?
Eugeo
407201201_40_a
Asuna
407201201_39_a
U-Uh, nothing, Alice...
Kirito
407201201_38_a
Eugeo
407201201_37_a
AmuSphere? Augma?
What are you two talking about?
Alice
407201201_36_a
but the AmuSphere shouldn't be
able to do anything dangerous
like that...
Kirito
407201201_35_a
Y-Yeah... The Augma could kinda
do that,
Kirito
407201201_34_a
Kirito
407201201_33_a
Umm... Kirito? The AmuSphere can't
erase a person's memory...right?
Asuna
407201201_32_a
y66
That is correct.
Urdr
407201201_31_a
Asuna
407201201_30_a
So in other words, if our memory
of the Divine Objects is wiped,
this won't happen again?
Kirito
407201201_29_a
You mean...
Eugeo
407201201_28_a
Eugeo
407201201_27_a
Wh-What speed!!
Alice
407201201_26_a
z66
Thus, we gods ensure that all
those who come into contact with
it have their memories erased.
Urdr
407201201_25_a
{66
Even mere knowledge of this power
can lead to calamity.
Urdr
407201201_24_a
Asuna
407201201_23_a
Y-Yeah, go on...
Kirito
407201201_22_a
y66
As you know, the Divine Objects
contain a power so terrible,
even we gods fear it.
Urdr
407201201_21_a
Kirito
407201201_20_a
There is?
Asuna
407201201_19_a
y66
Lastly...there is one thing
I feel I must tell you...
Urdr
407201201_18_a
Asuna
407201201_17_a
You can count on us!
Kirito
407201201_16_a
x66
Please, brave fairies and warriors
from another world, recover the
final Divine Object.
Urdr
407201201_15_a
Asuna
407201201_14_a
Yeah!
Kirito
407201201_13_a
Kirito
407201201_12_a
Hehe, if we have time, we can
always go back.
Asuna
407201201_11_a
Ha ha, yeah. We played karuta the
whole time and barely even got
to see the sights!
Eugeo
407201201_9_a
Alice
407201201_10_a
Asuna
407201201_8_a
I'm just sad we didn't have more
time to look around over there.
Kirito
407201201_7_a
Eugeo
407201201_6_a
I second that. Who would have
thought we'd have to chase our
quarry across multiple worlds?
Alice
407201201_5_a
Well, I for one am happy we
were finally able to finish off
that Hi-Mob.
Asuna
407201201_4_a
Asuna
407201201_3_a
Yup! Only one left to go.
Kirito
407201201_2_a

You have found another Divine
Object...

Strike him down, now!
While we have the chance!
Alice

M-My warp portal...
Y-You ruined it...!
Hi-Mob
407201101_48_a
MeE
Sinon
407201101_47_a
MeE
Asuna and I made a ton of them
back in ALO after he escaped the
first time, just in case.
Kirito
407201101_46_a
MeE
I dropped it in my inventory and,
luckily, it somehow managed to
convert over with my character.
Kirito
407201101_45_a
MeE
Yeah. It was originally an SAO
item that nullified teleportation
crystals.
Kirito
407201101_44_a
MeE
He got away from us once, so we
decided to come prepared this
time!
Asuna
407201101_43_a
MeE
Kirito
407201101_42_a
MeE
Asuna
407201101_41_a
MeE
What did you just do, Asuna?
Was that an item?!
Sinon
407201101_40_a
MeE
What?! How...?!
Hi-Mob
407201101_39_a
MeE
Kirito
407201101_38_a
MeE
Sinon
407201101_37_a

Got it! Haaah!!
Asuna
407201101_36_a
MeE
Asuna! You're up!
Kirito
407201101_35_a
MeE
Asuna
407201101_34_a
MeE
Kirito
407201101_33_a
MeE
He's trying to run!
Sinon
407201101_32_a
MeE
Eugeo
407201101_31_a
MeE
Alice
407201101_30_a
MeE
Ah!
Is that what I think it is?!
Liz
407201101_29_a
MeE
Hi-Mob

MeE
Gngh...!
Hi-Mob
407201101_27_a
MeE
Sinon

MeE
Yeah!
Kirito
407201101_25_a
MeE
Kirito
407201101_24_a
MeE
Sinon
407201101_23_a
MeE
Come on, everyone! Let's beat this
guy and get that Divine Object!
Asuna
407201101_22_a
MeE
Well, enough talking! We've got
him cornered this time!
Eugeo
407201101_21_a
MeE
Liz
407201101_20_a
MeE
Eugeo
407201101_19_a
MeE
Y-You're welcome, I suppose...
Alice
407201101_18_a
MeE
Sinon
407201101_17_a
MeE
Asuna
407201101_16_a
MeE
Cool. Thanks for the follow-up,
Alice.
Kirito
407201101_15_a
MeE
Perhaps our quarry used these
"Spirit Skills" to create those
copies.
Alice
407201101_14_a
MeE
I spoke to another player earlier,
and she told me that there are
Sacred Arts in this world too.
Alice
407201101_13_a
MeE
Eugeo
407201101_12_a
MeE
Alice
407201101_11_a
MeE
Well, that's pretty cheap.
No one told me he could
make copies of himself.
Liz
407201101_10_a
MeE
So shouting out the answer forced
him to take his true form.
Kirito
407201101_9_a
MeE
Yeah, I think the quest was set to
resolve when one of us revealed
the bad guy's secret.
Kirito
407201101_8_a
MeE
After you shouted, a bunch of
players all sprinted at each
other and merged into one person.
Sinon
407201101_7_a
MeE
Explanation, please?
Sinon
407201101_6_a
MeE
Kirito!
Asuna
407201101_5_a
MeE
Sinon
407201101_4_a
MeE
Asuna
407201101_3_a
MeE
There you are! We've been looking
for you!
Kirito
407201101_2_a
MeE
bg_event_ayakashi_street
So you saw through my
plot, did you?!
Hi-Mob
407201101_1_a
Am I seeing things?
They're merging into one
person! That's crazy!
Liz
407201001_32_a
Liz
407201001_31_a
Hey, a bunch of these players just
started sprinting at each other...
That's...weird.
Sinon
407201001_30_a
Curses!
Player B
407201001_29_a
Huh...? Kirito...?
Do you need to lie down?
Asuna
407201001_28_a
Good point...
Player B
407201001_27_a
Eugeo
407201001_26_a
Alice
407201001_25_a
We've seen through your scheme!
You've made copies of yourself
and are hiding in this tournament!
Kirito
407201001_24_a
Um, Kirito? Are you okay?
Eugeo
407201001_23_a
Hey! Hi-Mob! I mean, originally
cloaked Cait Sith bad guy dude!
Kirito
407201001_22_a
So that was his plan... He wanted
to beat us all quick and force us
out of the tournament...
Kirito
407201001_21_a
Alice and I lost pretty bad just
now. Our opponents were really
similar again, too.
Eugeo
407201001_20_a
Kirito
407201001_19_a
Eugeo
407201001_18_a
Kirito...? You're muttering to
yourself. Is everything all right?
Alice
407201001_17_a
But there was nothing stopping
him from assuming more than
one form!
Kirito
407201001_16_a
I was positive he had assumed
another form when he converted
over...
Kirito
407201001_15_a
Wait... Of course! One of my key
assumptions was wrong!
Kirito
407201001_14_a
So, there are a bunch of
suspicious characters here...
What can that mean...?
Kirito
407201001_13_a
But I've been keeping an eye on
Liz and Sinon's opponents too, and
they both seem pretty robotic...
Kirito
407201001_12_a
He's fast, smart, and has amazing
reactions, but he's not trying
anything to counter Asuna's strat.
Kirito
407201001_11_a
Asuna's opponent is pretty
fishy...
Kirito
407201001_10_a
but only the one with that dip in
intonation at the end of "winter"
is followed by "loneliness"!
Asuna
407201001_9_a
There are two poems that start
with "winter,"
Asuna
407201001_8_a
...loneliness in a mountain
village grows only deeper...
Reciter
407201001_7_a
...
Player B
407201001_6_a
Got it!
Asuna
407201001_5_a
Winter...
Reciter
407201001_4_a
...
Asuna
407201001_3_a
Asuna
407201001_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
...
Player B
407201001_1_a
Kirito
407200901_63_a
Yep! He's as good as caught!
Asuna
407200901_62_a
Oh, yeah. He won't escape us.
Sinon
407200901_61_a
Sinon
407200901_60_a
Huh. Well, I think we're close.
We'll get that dastardly fiend.
Liz
407200901_59_a
Sure, it can be devious and
clever, but it's not adaptable.
That's its biggest weakness.
Kirito
407200901_58_a
But I think even Cardinal can't
replicate an AI of their level
of complexity.
Kirito
407200901_57_a
Asuna
407200901_56_a
That's right. And those two are
effectively no different from a
human from the real world.
Kirito
407200901_55_a
Liz
407200901_54_a
Hey... This "Hi-Mob" of yours...
You said Cardinal made him from
Alice and Eugeo's data, right?
Sinon
407200901_53_a
Asuna
407200901_52_a
...
Kirito
407200901_51_a
Eugeo
407200901_50_a
Good luck.
Alice
407200901_49_a
Alice
407200901_48_a
Liz
407200901_47_a
Roger that! Alice and I will get
back to playing, then!
Eugeo
407200901_46_a
Since it's not an elimination
tournament, we still could
play one of them again.
Asuna
407200901_45_a
Asuna
407200901_44_a
Sinon
407200901_43_a
Yeah. Everyone, keep a close eye
on those guys if you get another
chance to play them.
Kirito
407200901_42_a
Liz
407200901_41_a
Eugeo
407200901_40_a
Interesting. I did get that sense
from our quarry as well. In that
case, I agree with you here.
Alice
407200901_39_a
However, he lacks... How do I put
this...? Adaptability? He's not
very flexible, I think.
Kirito
407200901_38_a
Asuna
407200901_37_a
Sinon
407200901_36_a
Okay, let me see if I can explain
it... Our enemy is smart, strong,
and fast.
Kirito
407200901_35_a
Alice
407200901_34_a
Liz
407200901_33_a
Okay, but why? Sure, they play
odd, but how's that tie in to our
Hi-Mob?
Eugeo
407200901_32_a
Asuna
407200901_31_a
Sinon
407200901_30_a
Exactly.
Kirito
407200901_29_a
Liz
407200901_28_a
Eugeo
407200901_27_a
You believe our quarry is among
their number?
Alice
407200901_26_a
Interesting. I think we've got
a nice lead on our enemy.
Asuna
407200901_25_a
They were all good, but they all
seemed inhuman and didn't have
any unique tricks or strategies...
Sinon
407200901_24_a
So there were a bunch of different
players who all played the same
way, huh...
Kirito
407200901_23_a
or how to fake them out and get
them to slap the wrong card,
and so on.
Asuna
407200901_22_a
Yeah... Like which cards to give
them,
Asuna
407200901_21_a
but you also need to come up with
strategies or unique playstyles to
counter each opponent.
Sinon
407200901_20_a
Kirito
407200901_19_a
Asuna
407200901_18_a
You need physical speed and mental
agility to play karuta well,
Sinon
407200901_17_a
He was really...cold and
calculating. He kinda didn't
even seem human.
Liz
407200901_16_a
Oh... I played someone like that
just now too.
Liz
407200901_15_a
In addition, their senses were
superhuman. Finally, none had
a unique playing style.
Eugeo
407200901_14_a
Alice
407200901_13_a
Liz
407200901_12_a
All of them had inhumanly-fast
reaction speeds and had perfectly
memorized every card.
Eugeo
407200901_11_a
Sinon
407200901_9_a
Similar? What is that supposed to
mean?
Asuna
407200901_8_a
Kirito
407200901_10_a
In fact, there were a number
of competitors who seemed
suspiciously similar.
Alice
407200901_7_a
Liz
407200901_6_a
Eugeo
407200901_5_a
Correct. The opponents both Eugeo
and I faced, along with a few
others.
Alice
407200901_4_a
Sinon
407200901_3_a
Asuna
407200901_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
So you played some suspicious
characters?
Kirito
407200901_1_a
!dE
!dE
O-Okay, if you're sure...
Eugeo
407200801_45_a
!dE
Nothing. Forget it.
Let us find Kirito.
Alice
407200801_44_a
!dE
What is it, Alice?
Eugeo
407200801_43_a
!dE
Good point...
Alice
407200801_42_a
!dE
He was strong, fast, and quick to
react. Additionally, his senses
were all superhuman...
Alice
407200801_41_a
!dE
I encountered a similarly fearsome
foe. His abilities were almost
frightening.
Alice
407200801_40_a
!dE
I lost too. My opponent had
all the cards memorized perfectly
and was really quick.
Eugeo
407200801_39_a
!dE
Yes. My opponent was extremely
skilled.
Alice
407200801_38_a
!dE
You lost, Alice?
Eugeo
407200801_37_a
!dE
...Yes, you do.
Alice
407200801_36_a
!dE
Alice
407200801_35_a
!dE
I win.
Player A
407200801_34_a
!dE
Sinon
407200801_33_a
!dE
Sure, fine. Let's go play some
cards.
Liz
407200801_32_a
!dE
Well, we're not going to be
fighting for a while yet. We need
to focus on this tournament now.
Kirito
407200801_31_a
!dE
War Maidens fight bare-handed and
are really acrobatic, but I feel
more comfortable with a sword.
Asuna
407200801_30_a
!dE
I was debating going War Maiden,
but I ended up picking Blade
Priestess.
Asuna
407200801_29_a
!dE
Asuna
407200801_28_a
!dE
Yeah, those classes fit you two
like gloves. I went with a dual-
wielding samurai: the Swordmaster.
Kirito
407200801_27_a
!dE
I HAD to go with Bladesmith.
Every blacksmith dreams about
being able to forge katanas.
Liz
407200801_26_a
!dE
I was pretty surprised to learn
that a game set in old Japan let
you use guns.
Sinon
407200801_25_a
!dE
Yeah. I picked Gunner myself,
and I'd love to try it out.
Sinon
407200801_24_a
!dE
Well, normally I'd spend a couple
hours tinkering with my new job
skills, but let's get our game on!
Liz
407200801_23_a
!dE
Liz
407200801_22_a
!dE
Hehe, good to hear.
Sinon
407200801_21_a
!dE
Ha ha, they beat me a bunch
already. They're really making
me look bad.
Kirito
407200801_20_a
!dE
Kirito
407200801_19_a
!dE
They both take things really
seriously, so they've already
mastered it and are kicking butt.
Asuna
407200801_18_a
!dE
Sinon
407200801_17_a
!dE
They're really playing karuta?
That game's super hard to pick up.
Are they getting creamed?
Liz
407200801_16_a
!dE
Asuna
407200801_15_a
!dE
Over there, at the tournament.
They're doing great.
Kirito
407200801_14_a
!dE
Liz
407200801_13_a
!dE
Where's Eugeo and Alice?
Sinon
407200801_12_a
!dE
Kirito
407200801_11_a
!dE
Seriously, we owe you big time!
You're lifesavers!
Asuna
407200801_10_a
!dE
Well, at least you and I had time
today, Liz. No one else was free.
Sinon
407200801_9_a
!dE
Sinon
407200801_8_a
!dE
Eh, it only took like two minutes.
And why didn't you call earlier?
I thought we were friends.
Liz
407200801_7_a
!dE
Thanks for converting over to
Asuka Empire to help us.
Kirito
407200801_6_a
!dE
Kirito
407200801_5_a
!dE
Wow, you two look SO cute!!
Asuna
407200801_4_a
!dE
You called?
Sinon
407200801_3_a
!dE
Sinon
407200801_2_a
!dE
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Hey-ho! What's up, guys?
Liz
407200801_1_a
Great thinking! The more people we
have, the better our chances.
Kirito
407200701_51_a
Hmm... I have an idea! Let's call
in backup! I'll see if Sinonon

Asuna

and discover if our Hi-Mob is
hiding here.
Kirito
407200701_49_a
but to play a lot of different
people, observe them up close,
Kirito
407200701_48_a
Asuna
407200701_47_a
Yeah... Our purpose here isn't to
win this tournament,
Kirito
407200701_46_a
Even if all four of us win many
matches, it has become difficult
to play all the contestants.
Alice
407200701_45_a
Alice
407200701_44_a
Wow, you're right.
Look at all of them.
Eugeo
407200701_43_a
Look, over there. There's a ton
of people lining up to join the
tournament.
Kirito
407200701_42_a
Why's that?
Asuna
407200701_41_a
Then again...I'm a bit worried.
I don't know if it's a great idea
for us to sit here practicing...
Kirito
407200701_40_a
Asuna
407200701_39_a
Ha ha, I'd be happy to.
Kirito
407200701_38_a
Very well! Teach me all these
sly tricks and devilish secrets,
Kirito!
Alice
407200701_37_a
Grr... This game is far more
complex than I anticipated...
Memorization is not enough, is it?
Alice
407200701_36_a
Alice
407200701_35_a
Yeah, there's no way I could pick
out slight variations in tone like
that...
Eugeo
407200701_34_a
W-Wow... Ha ha... "Easy," he says.
If you're a crazy, superhuman,
dual-wielding ninja master.
Asuna
407200701_33_a
I'll admit it depends on the
reciter, but if you know what
to listen for, it's easy.
Kirito
407200701_32_a
The intonation of the word is
slightly different depending on
what word follows.
Kirito
407200701_31_a
Nope. No luck here! It was a
simple trick someone just taught
me.
Kirito
407200701_30_a
Kirito
407200701_29_a
Good point. I think he rushed it
and got lucky.
Asuna
407200701_28_a
There are two poems that start
with "if"...
Alice
407200701_27_a
How did he know it would be "made
white with a deep-laid frost"?!
We only heard one syllable!
Alice
407200701_26_a
...I see that bridge...
Reciter
407200701_25_a
Eugeo
407200701_24_a
Huh?!
Alice

Eugeo

Sweet words will earn you nothing
but hard stares from me, Kirito.
Now, quiet. The next card comes...
Alice
407200701_18_a
But the speed at which she's
mastering every word and phrase
is incredible.
Kirito
407200701_17_a
Yeah, she's really impressive.
You and I played this when we were
kids, so we remember a bunch...
Kirito
407200701_16_a
Kirito
407200701_15_a
Hehe... Alice seems better than
Eugeo when it comes to memorizing
things.
Asuna
407200701_14_a
Y-Yes, ma'am...
Eugeo
407200701_13_a
Eugeo
407200701_12_a
Eugeo, we already went over this
earlier. I expected better of you.
Alice
407200701_11_a
In karuta, there are a number of
sets of poems that start the same.
You need to be careful.
Kirito
407200701_10_a
Asuna
407200701_9_a
Ha ha, there are two poems that
begin with "in the early dawn."
Kirito
407200701_8_a
Wait, really?
I thought the next part was
"as the moon comes into view"...?
Eugeo
407200701_7_a
Incorrect. This one.
Alice
407200701_6_a
When the mists on the Uji River
slowly lift and clear...

Yeah. It might not be the most
efficient plan we've come up with,
but it's a start.
Eugeo
407200601_36_a

Then again, it's better than
having no plan, I suppose.
Alice

Fine. But I do not think

Asuna

It looks like they'll teach you
all the basics of the game.

H-Hey, is that a practice area?
Let's go check it out!

I know how smart you guys are
you'll figure it out quick and
have a lot of fun!

True... But this is a multi-day

Well, we're not just here to

something we can learn.

Each match is decided in the blink

incredible!
Asuna

snatch the right card...

That group over there is playing

They're really fast...
Their reaction speed might
even beat Kirito's!

to do! To Ayakashi Alley!
Alice

I-I'm not laughing!
It was just a gasp...!
Alice

Oh my gosh! Alice just laughed!!

Asuna, you too? Give me a break!
Kirito
407200501_35_a
Hehe... You two have learned how
to read Kirito pretty well. I'd say
you're on to something.
Asuna

Asuna

H-Hey, hold it! Priorities! I have
'em! I know getting that Divine
Object comes first!
Kirito
407200501_32_a
you just HAVE to try anything
and everything. Especially games.
Eugeo
407200501_31_a
Alice
407200501_30_a
Alice has a very good point.
Every time you go somewhere new,
Eugeo
407200501_29_a
Asuna
407200501_28_a
N-No, not at all! Honest!
Kirito
407200501_27_a
Eugeo
407200501_26_a
Kirito... You have purposefully
formulated a paper-thin excuse to
play this karuta game. Admit it.
Alice
407200501_25_a
Exactly. So we join the tournament
and give each and every player a
close look over. Sound good?
Kirito
407200501_24_a
Hmm, that kinda makes sense. We
wouldn't expect him to be standing
in the spotlight.
Asuna
407200501_23_a
or playing himself. What better
place for him to hide in plain
sight than on stage?
Kirito
407200501_22_a
Asuna
407200501_21_a
I bet you our elusive enemy is
in Ayakashi Alley. Either watching
the tournament,
Kirito
407200501_20_a
Alice
407200501_19_a
Why?
Eugeo
407200501_18_a
Asuna
407200501_17_a
Well, hold on a sec. It might be
a good idea to join the karuta
tournament.
Kirito
407200501_16_a
Eugeo
407200501_15_a
I have no desire to waste my time
playing this game.
Alice
407200501_14_a
The rules are pretty simple, so
it's quite easy to pick up.
Asuna
407200501_13_a
Kirito
407200501_12_a
It's a game you play with picture
cards. It's sort of a tradition in
Japan... I mean, the Asuka Empire.
Asuna
407200501_11_a
What is this "karuta" you speak of?
Alice
407200501_9_a
Eugeo
407200501_10_a
Asuna
407200501_8_a
Supposedly, it's karuta. That game
is the most popular one here
during the New Year's season.
Kirito
407200501_7_a
Alice
407200501_6_a
Well, we know that there's a big,
traditional game tournament going
on today in Ayakashi Alley.
Eugeo
407200501_5_a
Kirito
407200501_4_a
The Mitsuba Detective Agency has
a good reputation, so I think so.
Asuna
407200501_3_a
Eugeo
407200501_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
That detective seemed extremely
unreliable. Do you really think we
can trust someone like that?
Alice
407200501_1_a
Ahh, interesting theory!
Kirito
407200401_36_a
My guess is, he found the most
crowded place in town and is
hiding out there.
Asuna
407200401_35_a
But I highly doubt he had the time
to come up with an even sneakier
or more ingenious plan.
Asuna
407200401_34_a
He came here so that he could hide
in plain sight, right? Like a tree
in the forest.
Asuna
407200401_33_a
Why do you say that, Asuna?
Kirito
407200401_32_a
Well, I think we won't have to
worry about any other deceptions
or tricks.
Asuna
407200401_31_a
He's way smarter than we
anticipated...
Kirito
407200401_30_a
Converting let him change his
appearance and lose us in this
holiday crowd.
Kirito
407200401_29_a
I wouldn't be surprised. He really
thought of everything, huh?
Kirito
407200401_28_a
Do you think that's why he came
here? To hide from us in all this
chaos?
Asuna
407200401_27_a
Asuna
407200401_26_a
Good point...
Kirito
407200401_25_a
Alice
407200401_24_a
All this commotion will make it
nearly impossible to find our
Hi-Mob.
Eugeo
407200401_23_a
Asuna
407200401_22_a
About what?
Kirito
407200401_21_a
Well, I like it here. It's fun!
But I am a bit worried...
Eugeo
407200401_20_a
Eugeo
407200401_19_a
I see. That explains why they are
all reveling so, but I find it a
bit too loud for my tastes.
Alice
407200401_18_a
Kirito
407200401_17_a
Yup! And they apparently celebrate
it in style!
Asuna
407200401_16_a
Alice
407200401_15_a
It's New Year's here?
Eugeo
407200401_14_a
Asuka Empire's right in the middle
of celebrating the New Year!
Kirito
407200401_13_a
Asuna
407200401_12_a
Well, I don't think it's "like"
a festival, I think it IS a
festival!
Kirito
407200401_11_a
It's like a festival!
Eugeo
407200401_10_a
Alice
407200401_9_a
You know, looking around,
this place is pretty flashy.
Everything's so...lively!
Eugeo
407200401_8_a
Kirito
407200401_7_a
Not really. I can take these kinds
of ghosts and goblins. It's the
horror stuff I can't deal with.
Asuna
407200401_6_a
Eugeo
407200401_5_a
You are not terrified by these
fearsome apparitions, Asuna?
Alice
407200401_4_a
Yeah, it's like all the monsters
and demons of Japanese folklore
are everywhere here!
Asuna
407200401_3_a
Asuna
407200401_2_a

monsters are all just walking
around town! So cool!

world's like!
Kirito
407200301_51_a
-bE
Eugeo
407200301_50_a
-bE
Understood. From here on, we shall
call our enemy "Hi-Mob."
Alice
407200301_49_a
-bE
I guess that's a good enough way
to refer to him for now.
Asuna
407200301_48_a
-bE
Kirito
407200301_47_a
-bE
It means "a very smart enemy."
Since we don't know what he looks
like anymore,
Asuna
407200301_46_a
-bE
Alice
407200301_45_a
-bE
Hi-Mob? What's that supposed
to mean?
Eugeo
407200301_44_a
-bE
Highly Intelligent Mob,
or "Hi-Mob" for short.
Kirito
407200301_43_a
-bE
Asuna
407200301_42_a
-bE
Exactly. Hey, I've got an idea.
Since he's no longer a Cait Sith,
let's give him a new name.
Kirito
407200301_41_a
-bE
Eugeo
407200301_40_a
-bE
So he no longer appears to be a
Cait Sith?
Alice
407200301_39_a
-bE
Hmm... Maybe disguising himself
was one of the reasons why he
jumped worlds...
Kirito
407200301_38_a
-bE
Asuna
407200301_37_a
-bE
Yeah, and it's likely he assumed
the clothes and form of a local
to blend in.
Kirito
407200301_36_a
-bE
Alice
407200301_35_a
-bE
He can do that?
Eugeo
407200301_34_a
-bE
I mean, when he came to this
world, he may have changed
his appearance.
Asuna
407200301_33_a
-bE
Kirito
407200301_32_a
-bE
About that...
When he converted...
Asuna
407200301_31_a
-bE
S-Sorry, Alice. I know...
We're here to find that
cloaked Cait Sith...
Eugeo
407200301_30_a
-bE
Eugeo, this is not a leisurely
outing. We have a purpose here,
or have you forgotten?
Alice
407200301_29_a
-bE
Alice
407200301_28_a
-bE
Well, I like it here! It seems
like a fun place! Can we go
explore now?
Eugeo
407200301_27_a
-bE
It has its own history and
culture. That's why the people and
buildings look totally different.
Kirito
407200301_26_a
-bE
Asuna
407200301_25_a
-bE
Y-Yeah, that's right. This world
is completely separate from
Alfheim.
Kirito
407200301_24_a
-bE
Eugeo
407200301_23_a

unique new outfits.

with...this one.
Kirito
407200201_26_a
It wants me to pick a job?
I guess I need to set a class
before joining...
Kirito
407200201_25_a
Huh, what's this?

Yeah!
Kazuto

I bet Alice and Eugeo can't wait
for us to get there and wake them
up!
Asuna
407200201_19_a
Yeah, you're right.
Well, let's get to it!
To a new world!
Asuna
407200201_18_a
We just need to predict his next
move, set a trap, and corner him.
Easy as that.
Kazuto
407200201_17_a
Well, their minds work just like
ours. In other words, AI or not,
he's got human limitations.
Kazuto
407200201_16_a
But that's also his weakness.
Cardinal based that Cait Sith off
Alice and Eugeo's data, right?
Kazuto
407200201_15_a
Still, I'm amazed he thought to
jump VRMMOs. Cardinal really
knows how to build an AI bad guy.
Asuna
407200201_14_a
I suppose that makes sense...
Asuna
407200201_13_a
Player character data or NPC.
Either way, the format's the same.
Kazuto
407200201_12_a
Yeah. It's connected to the Seed
Nexus, just like ALO, so data can
be transferred between the two.
Kazuto
407200201_11_a
Yuuki used to play Asuka Empire,
right?
Asuna
407200201_10_a
And it's got to be Asuka Empire.
It looked just like it.
Kazuto
407200201_9_a
Well, you saw it, right? That town
was definitely not from ALO. It
was a Japanese-themed VRMMO.
Kazuto
407200201_8_a
But...did that Cait Sith really
leave ALO and travel to another
VRMMO? It seems impossible...
Asuna
407200201_7_a
Yeah, that wouldn't have gone
over well...
Kazuto
407200201_6_a
And they were right to be. Not
like they would've believed us if
we said we're switching VRMMOs...
Asuna
407200201_5_a
They were pretty suspicious about
the whole affair.
Kazuto
407200201_4_a
I'm just glad we were able to
format Alice and Eugeo's data so
they could be converted over.

that's enough for me.

her and share my feelings...

And... those are?
Asuna

Heh. Maybe you're right.

wonderful miracles in VR already.

You know, maybe Sachi was watching
over her. We've experienced so
many seemingly impossible,
Asuna

for a minute back there...
Kirito
407101201_21_a
Yeah... I mean, not really.
I know that's impossible.
Kirito
407101201_20_a
She? You mean... Sachi?
Asuna
407101201_19_a
That she was watching over Feliz
from somewhere. Keeping her safe
and helping her understand...
Kirito
407101201_18_a
Yeah... This might sound insane,
but I had the feeling...
Kirito
407101201_17_a
Oh, right. You did say that she
was strangely articulate when
you rescued her from that cave.
Asuna
407101201_16_a
Yeah, it's nothing. I was just
thinking that she's back to

want to tell me, maybe I won't
get it, but I'm listening.

407100301_21_a
Really?
Asuna
407100301_20_a
That girl I told you about,
the one I couldn't save... Sachi.
She looked just like Feliz.
Kirito
407100301_19_a
Yeah...
Asuna
407100301_18_a
So... serious talk time. It's about
the Moonlit Black Cats. You
remember them, right?
Kirito
407100301_17_a
Ha ha, I'll keep that in mind...
Kirito
407100301_16_a
Hehe, nope. And you better
remember you can't hide
anything from me!
Asuna
407100301_15_a
Wow, nothing gets past you...
Kirito
407100301_14_a
Yeah. When you saw Feliz, you got
this super shocked look, then
seemed really sad.
Asuna
407100301_13_a
I... am?
Kirito
407100301_12_a
Okay, Kirito, what's wrong?
You're acting seriously weird.
Asuna
407100301_11_a
Yeah...
Kirito
407100301_10_a
Kirito
407100301_9_a
Hehe, looks like those four are
having fun.
Asuna
407100301_8_a
Sphica
407100301_7_a
I-I'll be fine! I can beat a
single stupid gross bug!
Seven
407100301_6_a
Feliz
407100301_5_a
Stop pointing and laughing,
Sphica! We should help her!
Yui
407100301_4_a
Ahahaha! Seven's under attack by
an icky bug army!
Sphica
407100301_3_a
Sphica
407100301_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
Eeek! A weird caterpillar thing
just popped out of the ground!
Seven
407100301_1_a
Hmm, let's see...
What mission to give you...?
Asuna
407100201_50_a
Asuna
407100201_49_a
Kirito
407100201_48_a
Yeah! Let's try hard and win it,
Feliz!
Yui
407100201_47_a
I'm on Yui's team? Okay.
Let's do our best.
Feliz
407100201_46_a
I'll beat you, Yui!
Just you watch!
Sphica
407100201_45_a
Feliz
407100201_44_a
Sphica
407100201_43_a
The more, the merrier!
Let's do it, Asuna!
Seven
407100201_42_a
Hehe, totally! You want to play
too, right, Yui?
Asuna
407100201_41_a
Are you sure, Mommy?
Yui
407100201_40_a
I'll come up with a quest for you,
to make it fair.
Asuna
407100201_39_a
Oh, I have an idea! How about Yui
plays this time too? She can team
up with Feliz!
Asuna
407100201_38_a
Asuna
407100201_37_a
Kirito
407100201_36_a
Hehe, sure thing!
Yui
407100201_35_a
Sphica beat me last time, but I am
going to wipe the floor with her
on the next one!
Seven
407100201_34_a
Great! Now that that's out of
the way, give us the next quest,
Yui!
Seven
407100201_33_a
Sphica
407100201_32_a
Seven
407100201_31_a
Oh... Okay. Hi.
Feliz
407100201_30_a
N-Nice to meet you, Feliz...
I'm Kirito. Yui's dad.
Kirito
407100201_29_a
Yeah, I...
It's...nothing...
Kirito
407100201_28_a
Kirito? Is everything okay?
Asuna
407100201_27_a
Sa...chi...?
Kirito
407100201_26_a
Yui
407100201_25_a
Asuna
407100201_24_a
gasp
...!!
Kirito
407100201_23_a
Hi...
Feliz
407100201_22_a
Hello there!
Sphica
407100201_21_a
Feliz
407100201_20_a
Sphica
407100201_19_a
Oh, look who it is!
What's up, guys?
Seven
407100201_18_a
Hehe. Hi there, everyone!
Asuna
407100201_17_a
Oh, looks like they finished!
Yui
407100201_16_a
Me...too...
Feliz
407100201_15_a
Aw man, I was so close too!
Seven
407100201_14_a
Yuuui! I finished!
Yay! I'm number one!!
Sphica
407100201_13_a
Oh, okay. That's good to hear!
Kirito
407100201_12_a
So I asked Sphica and Seven to
help her with my quests! Now
she's doing great!
Yui
407100201_11_a
Well, no... But she's a bit shy,
and I don't want her to feel
excluded...
Yui
407100201_10_a
What I'm trying to say is, can she
handle complex conversations and
really engage you guys?
Kirito
407100201_9_a
Ha ha, cool! But this new friend
of yours, Feliz... Is she just a
normal NPC?
Kirito
407100201_8_a
Hehe, everyone's gotten really
good at beating my quests, so I
thought I'd make a hard one!
Yui
407100201_7_a
Yeah, I overheard you giving out
the quest description. Sounds
tough!
Asuna
407100201_6_a
You bet! Everyone's playing a
quest I made!
Yui
407100201_5_a
Hi Yui! We're just passing by.
Having fun today?
Asuna
407100201_4_a
Kirito
407100201_3_a
Asuna
407100201_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
Mommy! Daddy!
You came to play with us?
Yui
407100201_1_a
Feliz? Cute name.
Kirito
407100101_28_a
Her name is...Feliz, I think it
was?
Asuna
407100101_27_a
Oh yeah, her. She's an NPC Yui
befriended recently in Undine
territory.
Asuna
407100101_26_a
Hey, who's that other girl?
Kirito
407100101_25_a
Huh... How cute. So who are her
playmates? Let's see, there's
Seven and Sphica...
Kirito
407100101_24_a
It's kinda like playing pretend,
but with quests? Whatever it is,
she's enjoying herself.
Asuna
407100101_23_a
So Yui's been making these easy
but fun ones for them to play.
Asuna
407100101_22_a
I think kids their age have more
fun doing shorter, simpler quests.
ALO tends to be epic and complex.
Asuna
407100101_21_a
Yui found a new hobby. She's been
making mini-quests, and having
her younger friends do them.
Asuna
407100101_20_a
Asuna
407100101_19_a
Hey, look, it's Yui.
What's she doing over there?
Kirito
407100101_18_a
Yui
407100101_17_a
???
407100101_16_a
Yaaay!
Sphica
407100101_15_a
Great! Everyone seems ready,
so let's get this flower gathering
quest started!
Yui
407100101_14_a
I'll...do my best too...
???
407100101_13_a
Ugh, why are Yui's quests always
so merciless?
Seven
407100101_12_a
Got it!
Sphica
407100101_11_a
Hehe, yeah, but only a little bit.
That's why they take so long to
harvest. Be careful with them!
Yui
407100101_10_a
Venom lilies?
Are they poisonous?
Seven
407100101_9_a
They're called "venom lilies".
You can identify them by the
black stripes in their petals.
Yui
407100101_8_a
That's not exactly correct. They
resemble normal blood lilies, but
they're actually a rare variety.
Yui
407100101_7_a
Hmm... From the picture, it looks
like we need to find blood lilies.
Seven
407100101_6_a
We're gathering the red ones on
this list, right? No problem!
I'm gonna win this contest!
Sphica
407100101_5_a
I'd like to make it a competition!
Who can collect the most?
Yui
407100101_4_a
Seven
407100101_3_a
Sphica
407100101_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
We're going to be gathering
flowers over here today.

Hehe, this is going to be a fun

Yui
407001201_67_a

Yeah!
Kirito
407001201_66_a
qXB
Cool, well...me and my carolers
are about to go out to celebrate
our musical victory! Want to come?
Seven
407001201_65_a
qXB
Kirito
407001201_64_a
qXB
Ahaha, yay! And we got some info
on a scary new bad guy too!
Asuna

qXB
Asuna
407001201_62_a
qXB
Yui
407001201_61_a
qXB
Apparently, yeah!
Kirito
407001201_60_a
qXB
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
Heh, escorting us around turned
out to be super profitable, huh?
Seven

qXB
Asuna
407001201_58_a
qXB
Yui
407001201_57_a

Ha ha, awesome! Random luck for
the win! I bet Alice and Eugeo
will be ecstatic!
Kirito
407001201_56_a
qXB
I had no idea what it was, but it
looked valuable, so...yoink!
Seven
407001201_55_a
qXB
It had this super-cool, ancient,
holy artifact vibe, so I thought
it might be rare.
Seven
407001201_54_a
qXB
Well, when we got here, we went
down into the church basement for
some rehearsing, and there it was.
Seven
407001201_53_a
qXB
Yui
407001201_52_a
qXB
Kirito
407001201_51_a
qXB
Seven, where did you find this?
Asuna
407001201_50_a
qXB
Huh? THIS is one of those things
you guys have been looking for?!
Seven
407001201_49_a
qXB
Asuna
407001201_48_a
qXB
That shape... That color...
It's a Divine Object!!

Asuna

Yui

I love free stuff!
Kirito
407001201_40_a
qXB
I wanted to give you guys
something besides cold hard Yuld
to thank you for all your help.
Seven
407001201_39_a
qXB
Hehe, I'm just teasin' ya.
Oh! By the way!
Seven
407001201_38_a
qXB
Yui
407001201_37_a
qXB
Kirito
407001201_36_a
qXB
N-No! We were doing nothing
of the sort!
Asuna
407001201_35_a
qXB
You two snuck out of my concert
to go find a romantic Christmas
corner to make out in, didn't you?
Seven
407001201_34_a
qXB
Yeah! Wait... Waaaiiit a second...
I know what's going on here!
Seven
407001201_33_a
qXB
Asuna
407001201_32_a
qXB
Yui
407001201_31_a
qXB
Oh, hey Seven.
Is the concert over already?
Kirito
407001201_30_a
qXB
There you are!! I've been looking
all over for you two lovebirds!
Seven
407001201_29_a
qXB
Asuna
407001201_28_a
qXB
Yui
407001201_27_a
qXB
Seriously. It's picked up some
reaaally annoying tricks lately.
Kirito
407001201_26_a
qXB
We definitely don't want that...
Still, Cardinal really likes
making our lives difficult.
Asuna
407001201_25_a
qXB
I mean, if we tried to explain it,
their heads would probably
explode.
Kirito
407001201_24_a
qXB
Let's keep this a secret from
Alice and Eugeo for now.
Kirito
407001201_23_a
qXB
So we have to fight a ridiculously
smart NPC? This sounds like it'll
be worse than PvP...
Asuna
407001201_22_a
qXB
Yeah...
Kirito
407001201_21_a
qXB
And unlike most monsters, we won't
be able to predict how or when
he'll move to oppose us.
Yui
407001201_20_a
qXB
I can almost guarantee that he'll
be back to cause trouble as you
work on the Divine Object quest.
Yui
407001201_19_a
qXB
I agree with your assessment of
the situation, Daddy.
Yui
407001201_18_a
qXB
Balance. It needed someone as
tough as both of them put together
to even the playing field.
Kirito
407001201_17_a
qXB
Why did it use data from both
Alice AND Eugeo?
Asuna
407001201_16_a
qXB
In other words, it made a big,
smart, scary boss for us.
Kirito
407001201_15_a
qXB
So Cardinal took all the data it'd
gathered on the two and used that
to generate an advanced AI NPC.
Kirito
407001201_14_a
qXB
...the template? Well, with Alice
and Eugeo on our side, it needed
an equally smart and badass enemy.
Kirito
407001201_13_a
qXB
Then it all clicked. Bad guy boss
character for the epic Divine
Object quest. But where to get...
Kirito
407001201_12_a
qXB
It was an educated guess.
I thought to myself: why, and how,
did Cardinal create this NPC?
Kirito
407001201_11_a
qXB
So you noticed, Daddy?
Yui
407001201_10_a
qXB
What?! No way!
Asuna
407001201_9_a
qXB
Yeah, I know.
Eugeo and Alice, right?
Kirito
407001201_8_a
qXB
And I have bad news: the personal
data used to generate him is
based off of
Yui
407001201_7_a
qXB
Likely, Cardinal decided the quest
needed a specific antagonist for
you to face.
Yui
407001201_6_a
qXB
If I were to hazard a guess, I'd
say that he was created as part
of the Divine Object quest.
Yui
407001201_5_a
qXB
Yeah, his "I am a Cait Sith"
statement of the obvious
was totally an NPC line.
Kirito
407001201_4_a
qXB
Kirito
407001201_3_a
qXB
Asuna
407001201_2_a
qXB
bg_event_tree_snow_christmas
That black-cloaked Cait Sith is
most definitely an enemy NPC.
Yui
407001201_1_a
No, it's okay. They're almost
done, anyway. Let's have this
talk.
Asuna
407001101_37_a
Or would you rather stay here
until they're finished?
Kirito
407001101_36_a
Yeah... I want to talk to Yui
about him somewhere quiet...
Let's head outside, Asuna.
Kirito
407001101_35_a
That mysterious cloaked Cait Sith
is still on your mind, huh?
Asuna
407001101_34_a
Well...
Kirito
407001101_33_a
You say that, but you don't look
too happy.
Asuna
407001101_32_a
Ha ha, yeah, they're really into
it. I'm glad we were able to get
them here safely.
Kirito
407001101_31_a
Kirito
407001101_30_a
Hehe, it looks like Seven and her
carolers have touched our friends'
hearts.
Asuna
407001101_29_a
And neither will I... They really
do make you feel all warm and
happy inside...
Eugeo
407001101_28_a
But I shall never forget the
heavenly notes of these carols...
Alice
407001101_27_a
I have to say, I think I despise
the gaudy decorations of this
Christmas of yours...
Alice
407001101_26_a
Eugeo
407001101_25_a
Alice
407001101_24_a
Ahhh... What an angelic sound...
Arianrhod
407001101_23_a
Siiiiiilent Niiiiight...
Carolers
407001101_22_a
bg_12_church_room
Siiiiiilent Niiiiight...
Seven
407001101_21_a
Eugeo
407001101_20_a
Alice
407001101_19_a
Excellent. Now, let us resume our
journey.
Arianrhod
407001101_18_a
Y-Yeah, I guess...
Kirito
407001101_17_a
Kirito
407001101_16_a
Asuna
407001101_15_a
Yeah! Besides, if he comes back,
we'll just beat the stuffing out
of him again!
Seven
407001101_14_a
Alice
407001101_13_a
Arianrhod
407001101_12_a
I see... Well, I'm just glad you
two are okay.
Eugeo
407001101_11_a
Kirito
407001101_9_a
We found a guy in a black cloak,
but he summoned a bunch more
monsters and ran away.
Asuna
407001101_8_a
Seven
407001101_10_a
And you? Did you catch our
mysterious foe?
Alice
407001101_7_a
Eugeo
407001101_6_a
Alice
407001101_5_a
Of course. We slew every last
monster lurking in this area.
Arianrhod
407001101_4_a
Asuna
407001101_3_a
Is everyone okay?
Kirito
407001101_2_a
bg_18_mountain_snow
Hey, they're back!
Yoohoo! Kirito! Asuna!
Seven
407001101_1_a
Y-Yeah, but... Oh, fine!
Asuna
407001001_38_a
Asuna, let him go! We need to
deal with these guys right now!
Kirito
407001001_37_a
Yui
407001001_36_a
Kirito
407001001_35_a
Hey, he's running away!
Asuna
407001001_34_a
We will meet again, you meddling
miscreants!
???
407001001_33_a
Asuna
407001001_32_a
Yui
407001001_31_a
Oh, come on, how many monsters
can this guy summon?!
Kirito
407001001_30_a
Grawwwrrr!!
Monster
407001001_29_a
Summoning complete! Arise,
my monstrous friends! Arise!
???
407001001_28_a
Kirito
407001001_27_a
Asuna
407001001_26_a
If my theory is right, his
personal data is based off of--
Yui
407001001_25_a
Seriously? There are NPCs that
can do that? I mean, besides you?
And, uh, Alice and Eugeo?
Kirito
407001001_24_a
That's correct. He has high-level
cognitive abilities and system
privileges to enter town.
Yui
407001001_23_a
He's not?! Then...what is he?
An NPC with an advanced AI?
Kirito
407001001_22_a
Now that we're this close, I've
finally been able to analyze him!
He's...not a player!
Yui
407001001_21_a
Yui!
Kirito
407001001_20_a
Daddy! Mommy!
Yui
407001001_19_a
Kirito
407001001_18_a
He eavesdropped on the KoB in
town? If he can enter a safe zone,
he's a player, right...?
Asuna
407001001_17_a
And thus, I called upon a horde of
my monstrous allies! And yet, it
was not enough to stop you...
???
407001001_16_a
I overheard those white-clad
warriors say they would come
to your aid while I was in town...
???
407001001_15_a
Asuna
407001001_14_a
Yeah...? Not exactly the question,
but thanks?

You are right!
I am...a Cait Sith!!

Kirito
407001001_11_a
Yeah, that outfit makes it really
hard to say for sure...
Asuna
407001001_10_a
I knew it was a player!
Wait a sec, is it a player?
I...can't tell.
Kirito
407001001_9_a
Kirito
407001001_8_a
This Cait Sith tamed all these
monsters? Seriously?

You've finally come...

407001001_6_a
Asuna

Thanks, Arianrhod! But are you

But...who?
Kirito
407000901_40_a

No way. These attacks are
definitely planned. Someone's
orchestrating this, for certain.
Kirito

Buuut you don't think it's that
simple this time, do you?

You're all fine with that, right?

Hmm... How about this?
We're even, as long as you
let us listen to your concert.

Kirito
407000801_42_a
Asuna

You sure? I'd feel pretty bad
making you work for free...
Seven

Besides, it's Christmas! We can't
let some foul knaves interfere
with a group of innocent carolers!
Arianrhod
407000801_39_a
Please, no payment is necessary.
We all owe Kirito and Asuna some
payback for all their help...
Arianrhod
407000801_38_a
Kirito
407000801_37_a
I've got no reason to say no!
The pay's not changing though, so
your cut's going down. That cool?
Seven

And they're all good people,
and super reliable! Do you
mind if they join us today?

Seven, Arianrhod and her friends

Kirito
407000801_32_a
I thought I told you, I'm not
your commander anymore!
Oh, never mind...
Arianrhod
407000801_31_a
Our swords are always yours to
command, Commander! Let's show
'em what the new KoB is made of!
KoB Guild Member
407000801_30_a
Still, we've teamed up again for
this escort quest of yours.
Arianrhod
407000801_29_a
Hah, sort of. We've disbanded the
KoB, if you recall.
Arianrhod
407000801_28_a
Seven
407000801_27_a
Kirito

Hey Arianrhod! Oh wow, you brought
all of the new KoB members too!

Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

Who is this mysterious knight

Seven
407000801_21_a
Asuna
407000801_20_a
Seven
407000801_19_a
Right, and we've even called in
the ultimate bodyguard for backup
today, just in case.
Kirito
407000801_18_a
Alice
407000801_17_a
We'll be fine! We've held them off

Asuna, it's still too early to
breathe easy. Save it until
after today's escort duty.
Alice
407000801_11_a
but with your carolers debuffing
them, they're not that big of a
deal.
Asuna
407000801_10_a
Well, we were happy to help.
Besides, those monsters were
tough,
Asuna
407000801_9_a
But seriously, thanks for
everything. You really saved
our bacon.
Seven
407000801_8_a
Yup! Today's the last time we're
doing this, so we won't need your
escort services again.
Seven
407000801_7_a
So, you need us to escort your
carolers around again today,
right?
Kirito
407000801_6_a
You got it!!

they shouldn't be much trouble.

Hehe, that's right.

Asuna
407000701_21_a

Kirito
407000701_20_a
}VB
Alllright, then let's do this!
Seven
407000701_19_a
}VB
Totally!
Kirito
407000701_18_a
}VB
They need to work off some steam!
Besides, you guys will be there in
a pinch, right?
Seven
407000701_17_a
}VB
Pfft, they'll be fine! Besides,
everyone's pretty stressed
out over all this.
Seven
407000701_16_a
}VB
But then we'll have to put those
carolers on the front lines...
Can they handle it?
Asuna
407000701_15_a
}VB
Oh, that's a great idea!
It just might work!
Kirito
407000701_14_a
}VB
So... Want to conduct a little
hands-on experiment?
Seven
407000701_13_a
}VB
You think our carols might hurt
these monsters, right?
Seven
407000701_12_a
}VB
Seven?!
Kirito
407000701_11_a

Gah! These things just don't
learn! Come on, Asuna!
It's fighting time!
Kirito
407000701_6_a

Enemies, from behind us! Those
monsters from earlier formed a
herd and are coming this way!

Seven
407000701_4_a

Asuna

Eugeo? What's the problem?!
Kirito
407000701_2_a
}VB
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
Kirito! Asuna!
Eugeo
407000701_1_a
But why would a player even do
that?
Asuna
407000601_28_a
Ahhh, that makes sense! Even an
NPC with a high-level AI probably
couldn't issue an order like that.
Seven
407000601_27_a
It's probably not an NPC...
But a player!!
Kirito
407000601_26_a
No, that's not entirely right.
If there's a Cait Sith ordering
these monsters to attack us...
Kirito
407000601_25_a
Alice and Eugeo's Cait Sith NPC?
Asuna
407000601_24_a
Exactly. And if we follow this
thread to its logical conclusion,
there's only one possibility.
Kirito
407000601_23_a
That's the only explanation for
why the system would change
their behavior to attack us.
Seven
407000601_22_a
I see what you're getting at.
The monsters are following
someONE's orders, right?
Seven
407000601_21_a
then something had to have the
power to alter their default
behavior patterns.
Kirito
407000601_20_a
If these monsters' orders are to
attack "those stupid fairies
singing their stupid songs,"
Kirito
407000601_19_a
Well, I can see how that might
work, but it still doesn't add up.
Kirito
407000601_18_a
It's got to have something to do
with the singing. Maybe holy hymns
hurt them?
Asuna
407000601_17_a
In other words, there's no logical
link between these quest monsters
and you. It does not compute.
Kirito
407000601_16_a
Yup. And your carolers are a
bunch of players who got
together for some fun.
Kirito
407000601_15_a
If I remember right, it's an auto-
generated quest made by Cardinal
to process this foreign data.
Seven
407000601_14_a
You're talking about this special
quest that started when Alice and
Eugeo came to our world, right?
Seven
407000601_13_a
I know what you mean...
Asuna
407000601_12_a
But that still doesn't add up.
There's just too much that
doesn't make sense here...
Kirito
407000601_11_a
Here's the thing. I think we can
all agree these monsters are
Divine Object quest mobs...
Kirito
407000601_10_a
I didn't want to say this in front
of them before, but...
Kirito
407000601_9_a
Oh yeah...
Kirito
407000601_8_a
That's why we're up here, guarding
the front. Standard escort
positioning.
Seven
407000601_7_a
They're in the back, acting as
rear guard.
Asuna
407000601_6_a
Where's Eugeo and Alice?
Kirito
407000601_5_a
Kirito? What's up?
Asuna
407000601_4_a

Of course!
Eugeo

Eugeo
407000501_67_a
Right.
Alice
407000501_66_a
You're with me, right?!
Asuna
407000501_65_a
Oh, I see... Well, I'll do my
best to keep all of you safe!
I swear it!
Asuna
407000501_64_a
Yeah. I only convinced her to stay
because you guys are here to keep
us safe now.
Seven
407000501_63_a
If I had elite mobs chasing me
wherever I went, I'd be upset too.
Kirito
407000501_62_a
Hmm... I guess I can't blame them.
Kirito
407000501_61_a
Some of the carolers just don't
want to keep dealing with the
risk anymore.
Seven
407000501_60_a
And I get it. It totally ruins
your day when you get killed...
It's just not fun.
Seven
407000501_59_a
We've been attacked so often,
and that kid's gotten the death
penalty so many times...
Seven
407000501_58_a
But...why?!
Asuna
407000501_57_a
Yeah, well... She told me she
wanted to quit. I managed to
convince her not to, but...
Seven
407000501_56_a
Seven? You look upset...
Is something wrong?
Asuna
407000501_55_a
Kirito
407000501_54_a

Eugeo

Explain.
Alice
407000501_44_a
Asuna
407000501_43_a
No, it's just that...then it all
makes even LESS sense...
Kirito
407000501_42_a
Eugeo
407000501_41_a
Is there a flaw in my logic?
Alice
407000501_40_a
Asuna
407000501_39_a
That's right... So you're saying
monsters don't like holy songs?
I guess that makes sense, but...
Kirito
407000501_38_a
...have the strange power to
enhance their listeners'
abilities.
Alice
407000501_37_a
Eugeo
407000501_36_a
I thought the same. Additionally,
I've heard that Pooka's
instruments and voices...
Alice
407000501_35_a
Asuna
407000501_34_a
Hmm...
Kirito
407000501_33_a
Alice
407000501_32_a
Well, I was thinking... Maybe the
monsters just can't stand the
divine beauty of their songs?
Eugeo
407000501_31_a
Kirito
407000501_30_a
Yeah, pretty much.
Why do you mention it?
Asuna
407000501_29_a
Alice
407000501_28_a
Hey, guys? I've been thinking...
Carolers sing holy hymns, right?
Eugeo
407000501_27_a
I wonder what that caroler wanted
with Seven...
Asuna
407000501_26_a
Asuna
407000501_25_a
Have fun.
Kirito
407000501_24_a
Asuna
407000501_23_a
Kirito
407000501_22_a
Ah, sure.
Sorry, guys, be right back.
Seven
407000501_21_a
Hey, Seven? Can I borrow you for
a second?
Caroler
407000501_20_a
Alice
407000501_19_a
But then all this makes even less
sense! Why are they attacking
these carolers?
Eugeo
407000501_18_a
Yeah... There's no denying that...
Asuna
407000501_17_a
Asuna
407000501_16_a
Seven
407000501_15_a
Yeah, for sure. And they're crazy
strong, too. There's no doubt
they're Divine Object monsters.
Kirito
407000501_14_a
You know what sort of beast it is
we face.
Alice
407000501_13_a
Eugeo
407000501_12_a
You understand now that you've
fought them too, right?
Alice
407000501_11_a

These things really push my

Alice

She's right... They definitely

Kirito

Wah! And right on cue...
We've got company, guys!
Seven
407000401_19_a
QUB
Grawwwrgh!!
Monster
407000401_18_a
QUB
Yeah, seriously... Our suspect is
a Cait Sith, but I can't fathom
their motives...
Asuna
407000401_17_a
QUB
Which makes me wonder even more...
Who's attacking you, and why?
Kirito
407000401_16_a
QUB
Hehe... If you want to phrase that
for this world, you've become
traveling minstrels.
Asuna
407000401_15_a
QUB
Kirito
407000401_14_a
QUB
Asuna
407000401_13_a
QUB
Exactly! And that's why Seven's
Carolers are going on tour!
Seven
407000401_12_a
QUB
As such, it would be a shame to
hide in town. You want to share
your songs with the world, right?
Alice
407000401_11_a
QUB
From what I've learned, this is
the only time of the year you
can carol.
Alice
407000401_9_a
QUB
Eugeo
407000401_10_a
QUB
There's questing to be done,

activities...
Asuna
407000401_8_a
QUB
But it's not like this is the only
thing you guys have on your
plates...
Asuna
407000401_7_a
QUB
It just sucks that we're getting
attacked for doing it...
Seven
407000401_6_a
QUB
Well, compared to all the effort
we spent practicing, this is easy.
Besides, we want to carol.
Seven
407000401_5_a
QUB
Totally. I'm impressed that you're
caroling around in so many
different places, though.

Seven
407000301_38_a
Asuna

Then it's settled!
Seven...quest accepted!
Kirito
407000301_36_a
Yeah, and I want to pay you guys
back for letting me listen to your
wonderful song!
Eugeo
407000301_35_a
Eugeo
407000301_34_a
Normally I'd prioritize our search
for the Divine Objects, but I
can't ignore your friend's plight.
Alice
407000301_33_a
Asuna
407000301_32_a
I think Asuna and I are down.
What about you guys?
Kirito
407000301_31_a
Wow, okay! You two have officially
impressed me! Now come on, let's
go! The pay's great, promise!
Seven
407000301_30_a
I'm...kinda shocked. Kirito,
they totally stole your thunder!
Asuna
407000301_29_a
Seven
407000301_28_a
Asuna
407000301_27_a
Ha ha, wow! That's exactly what
I was thinking.
Kirito
407000301_26_a
Which means we may find a Cait
Sith lurking in the shadows nearby
when the monsters attack.
Alice
407000301_25_a
They are the only fairies
capable of temporarily
controlling monsters...
Alice
407000301_24_a
Hmm... If a fairy is behind this,
it would have to be a Cait Sith.
Eugeo
407000301_23_a
Eugeo
407000301_22_a
We've been in this world for some
time now. It's only natural that
we'd pick up on your world's rules.
Alice
407000301_21_a
Kirito
407000301_20_a
Seven
407000301_19_a
Double wow. Alice, you've got
great insight.
Asuna
407000301_18_a
Eugeo
407000301_17_a
Monsters usually attack at random,
so you think something is behind
this unusual behavior?
Alice
407000301_16_a
Seven
407000301_15_a
Asuna
407000301_14_a
Yeah, wow. I'm surprised you
remembered that! You're really
learning a lot about us, Eugeo.
Kirito
407000301_13_a
Alice
407000301_12_a
You said your group's mostly
Pooka, right? Pooka are relatively
weak for fairies, correct?
Eugeo
407000301_11_a
And ugh! It's always weird and
strong monsters, and they spawn
right next of us!
Seven
407000301_9_a
Asuna
407000301_10_a
Zero idea. We thought it was
just random bad luck at first,
but they're definitely after us.
Seven
407000301_8_a
Er, I mean fairy-led volunteer
effort, right? Why would monsters
target you?
Asuna
407000301_7_a
Uhh...what? How does that even
make sense? You carolers are
a player-ru--
Asuna
407000301_6_a
Ha ha, very funny. No, we've got
some slippery monsters after our
caroling hides.
Seven
407000301_5_a
Bodyguards? For carolers?
Just what are we supposed to
protect you from, music critics?

Asuna

My carolers need some bodyguards,

Seven
407000301_1_a
Maybe? I need more info.
Kirito
407000201_41_a
You two can help too. So, Kirito,
Asuna... Want to go on a little
quest for me?
Seven
407000201_40_a
Hmm... Convenient! I think I have
a job for two ultimate warriors
like yourselves...
Seven
407000201_39_a
It's literally insane how good
they are.
Kirito
407000201_38_a
I'm told you two are ridiculously
good at fighting.
Seven
407000201_37_a
Kirito
407000201_36_a
Asuna
407000201_35_a
Ahh, so you're these two warriors
from another dimension I've heard
so much about. Cool.
Seven
407000201_34_a
You may call me Alice Synthesis
Thirty.
Alice
407000201_33_a
Alice
407000201_32_a
So you're friends with this girl?
In that case, hi there! My name's
Eugeo. Nice to meet you!
Eugeo
407000201_31_a
Asuna
407000201_30_a
Right?!
Seven
407000201_29_a
You're digging that hole deeper,
Kirito. Anyway, with you at their
head, no wonder they're so good.
Asuna
407000201_28_a
Er, I just meant that you're an
idol, right? I thought your songs
would be more...peppy?
Kirito
407000201_27_a
What do you mean, "surprisingly"?!
Seven
407000201_26_a
Cool. Come to think of it, a lot
of your songs are surprisingly
melodic too.
Kirito
407000201_25_a
Besides, everyone who joined up
is a Pooka or just likes singing,
so it's an easy gig.
Seven
407000201_24_a
The player who came up with the
idea practically begged me to whip
these guys into singing shape.
Seven
407000201_23_a
You bet they're mine! I'm the
leader of this little troupe!
Seven
407000201_22_a
My carolers?
Asuna
407000201_21_a
Heh, don't tell me the dulcet
tones of my carolers beckoned
you hither?
Seven
407000201_20_a
Asuna
407000201_19_a
Well, if it isn't Seven!
Kirito
407000201_18_a

407000201_12_a
It's...incredible. To think that
training could produce a sound

Alice

I assume, anyway.
Asuna
407000201_10_a
Kirito
407000201_9_a
Hehe! No, silly! They've all just
practiced really hard.
Asuna

Eugeo

Fairies they may be, but they have
the voices of angels. Do they have
some special Calling?
Alice
407000201_6_a
Yeah, and they've got both kids
and adults singing. It's such a

Ha. I guess we should fill him
in on the boss too.
Kirito
406901201_21_a
Yeah. We'll have to say
"hi" to Klein when we get back
to the entrance.
Asuna
406901201_20_a
From what I hear, there is! So,
let's take a quick break, then get
back to exploring this place!
Kirito
406901201_19_a
Yeah. We might have beaten it,
but there's probably more content
to find in here.
Sinon
406901201_18_a
And it certainly made the whole
affair more interesting!
Asuna
406901201_17_a
That was one seriously unique
dungeon. That poker battle hybrid
was actually pretty fun.
Asuna
406901201_16_a
And it looks like we're the first
ones to do it, too!
Kirito
406901201_15_a
Alright! We did it! We beat the
labyrinth!
Kirito
406901201_14_a
Yay! And we don't even have to
beat up these guys, either!
Asuna
406901201_13_a
I guess a double full house beats
four of a kind? Who knew.
Sinon
406901201_12_a
Really? I mean, woohoo!
Kirito
406901201_11_a
Ah, what a shame.
I suppose we must let you pass.
Card Soldier Boss

N-No... Nooo!
It appears you win!
Card Soldier Boss
406901201_9_a
So, how did you like that,
boss guys?
Kirito
406901201_8_a
sigh
Anyway, we've got our
special six-card hand. Let's hope
it works.
Asuna
406901201_7_a
C-Come on, humor me! A final uber

It builds dramatic tension.

bg_event_wonderland
We've got 3 sevens and 3 threes.
We've got an, uh...
Kirito
406901201_1_a
Alright, everything's riding on
this! Let's do it!
Kirito
406901101_29_a
Yeah... It's a better idea than my
five sevens, at least.
Asuna
406901101_28_a
We know our four sevens can't win.
It's a desperate gamble,
but probably our only hope.
Sinon
406901101_27_a
But with the special rules here in
this labyrinth, it's worth a shot.
Sinon
406901101_26_a
I definitely haven't heard of this
hand before.
Sinon
406901101_25_a
Sssh!
Sinon
406901101_24_a
Huh...?
Asuna
406901101_23_a
So what do you think will happen
if we use this, and this?
Kirito
406901101_22_a
That became a royal straight
flush special. I still think it's
a good name, by the way.
Kirito
406901101_21_a
Hold up... We sort of cheated
earlier by putting up six of the
same suit, right?
Kirito
406901101_20_a
...
Kirito
406901101_19_a
We made it this far... I don't
want to have to do this whole
stupid labyrinth over!
Sinon
406901101_18_a
Sssh!
Kirito
406901101_17_a
Now, show us your hand!
Card Soldier Boss
406901101_16_a
Ahaha... Yeah, I guess not.
Asuna
406901101_15_a
I don't think they'll let us get
away with having two of the
same card in the same hand...
Sinon
406901101_14_a
Can't we cheat and make a five of
a kind?
Asuna
406901101_13_a
H-Hey, we have a fifth seven,
right?
Asuna
406901101_12_a
No...
Kirito
406901101_11_a
We only have four sevens!
We're going to lose!
Asuna
406901101_10_a
Four jacks and a five...
They have a four of a kind too!
Kirito
406901101_9_a
Take this!
Card Soldier Boss
406901101_8_a
Well, we can't turn back, so it's
not like we're going to use
anything but our best hand...
Asuna
406901101_7_a
Really? They're just going to show
it to us like that? Anticlimactic
much?
Sinon
406901101_6_a
Here's our hand! Can you beat it?
Card Soldier Boss
406901101_5_a
Kirito
406901101_4_a
Asuna
406901101_3_a
Sinon
406901101_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Congratulations on making it
this far, challengers! This is
the final showdown!
Card Soldier Boss
406901101_1_a
Yeah, let's book it!
Kirito
406901001_31_a
Yeah, so can we go already?
These bloodthirsty Card Soldiers
are getting pretty close!
Asuna
406901001_30_a
Not bad, but not that great.
I guess it's our best shot.
Sinon
406901001_29_a
Hmm... We have four of a kind.
Sevens.
Kirito
406901001_28_a
So, what's our strongest hand
right now?
Sinon
406901001_27_a
You're right. Let's do it.
Kirito
406901001_26_a
We don't have much choice.
Let's take on this boss.
Asuna
406901001_25_a
So, I get why they forced
this scenario, but still...
This is bad...
Kirito
406901001_24_a
Well, poker's a game about taking
risks, right? We're not betting
chips, but it's the same thing.
Kirito
406901001_23_a
Those Card Soldiers will be
invincible, and we'll have no
choice but to fight until we die.
Sinon
406901001_22_a
But the stakes are high.
If we lose...
Sinon
406901001_21_a
Yeah. We have a better chance of
taking out five of them in a
poker match than ten.
Asuna
406901001_20_a
So there's no turning back...
This must be the game's way of
forcing us to fight this boss.
Kirito
406901001_19_a
Ten Card Soldiers?!
And they're coming this way!!
Kirito
406901001_18_a
...That's not good.
Sinon
406901001_17_a
S-Sinonon! Behind us!!
Asuna
406901001_16_a
What do we do? Fall back for now
and collect cards until we have
the ultimate hand?
Sinon
406901001_15_a
But we just don't have the cards
for it anymore...
Kirito
406901001_14_a
Yeah... It'd be great if we could
pull the same trick we used on
Klein...
Kirito
406901001_13_a
The best they can have is a royal
straight flush, like Klein did.
Asuna
406901001_12_a
I guess so... We don't know what
hand they've got, but there are
five of them...
Asuna
406901001_11_a
Really? Maybe this is some sort
of final boss special match or
something?
Kirito
406901001_10_a
Those Card Soldiers...
They're blank!
Sinon
406901001_9_a
What is it, Sinonon?
Asuna
406901001_8_a
Now, what's their hand...? Huh?
Sinon
406901001_7_a
Hold it! I see Card Soldiers,
ready to ambush us!
Kirito
406901001_6_a
Yay, we did it! We're the first
ones here!
Asuna
406901001_5_a
It looks like the end of this
labyrinth.
Sinon
406901001_4_a
Asuna
406901001_3_a
Sinon
406901001_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Hey, is that what I think it is?
Kirito
406901001_1_a
Yeah!
Asuna
406900901_51_a
How about we head to the
finish line?
Kirito
406900901_50_a
So, now that Klein's crying at the
start of the labyrinth...
Kirito
406900901_49_a
Asuna
406900901_48_a
Sinon
406900901_47_a
Ha ha ha... Sorry, Klein.
Kirito
406900901_46_a
Oh come OOON!! That is SO CHEAP!!
I'll get you for this, K-dawg!
You hear me, I'll get you!!
Klein
406900901_45_a
Sinon
406900901_44_a
Kirito
406900901_43_a
D-Dude...
Akuto (Furinkazan Member)
406900901_42_a
Ahaha, it totally is!
Asuna
406900901_41_a
Really? That's such a lame
name, Kirito.
Sinon
406900901_40_a
Hmm, I guess it needs a name.
Let's call it a royal straight
flush...special.
Kirito
406900901_39_a
Asuna
406900901_38_a
Sinon
406900901_37_a
It doesn't.
Not in normal poker, anyway.
Kirito
406900901_36_a
But...that hand doesn't even make
sense! It doesn't exist!
Klein
406900901_35_a
Kirito
406900901_34_a
Apparently, it's nearly impossible
to find the joker. We got very
lucky.
Sinon
406900901_33_a
So three of us, times two slots
each, equals six cards.
Sinon
406900901_32_a
It's a way to even the playing
field for small parties like us.
Asuna
406900901_31_a
He gave us each one extra card
slot.
Asuna
406900901_30_a
Sinon
406900901_29_a
Kirito
406900901_28_a
Hehe, we're not cheating, Klein.
We met a rare character:
the joker.
Asuna
406900901_27_a
That doesn't even make sense!!
You can't use six cards!
It's against the rules!
Klein
406900901_26_a
A royal straight flush of hearts,
PLUS the nine?!
Klein
406900901_25_a
You've got SIX cards?!
Klein
406900901_24_a
What...?
How is that even... DUUUDE?!
Klein
406900901_23_a
Sinon
406900901_22_a
Asuna
406900901_21_a
Ready for our hand?
Because here it comes!
Kirito
406900901_20_a
Wait. I'm not liking the sound
of this...
Klein
406900901_19_a
Sinon
406900901_18_a
Asuna
406900901_17_a
I wouldn't say "nothing."
Of course, you'd be right
anywhere but this dungeon.
Kirito
406900901_16_a
Heh! There's nothing that can beat
this hand!
Klein
406900901_15_a
Sinon
406900901_14_a
That's the Klein I know and
tolerate. You must've been
saving that this whole time.
Kirito
406900901_13_a
...
Sinon
406900901_12_a
Sssh!
Asuna
406900901_9_a
Kirito
406900901_11_a
Sinon
406900901_10_a
Royal straight flush!!
Klein
406900901_8_a
You ready to get owned?!
Klein
406900901_7_a
Sinon
406900901_6_a
Asuna
406900901_5_a
Oh, you can bet we're bringing it!
Kirito
406900901_4_a
Y-Yeah, me too...
Alright! Bring it on, K-dawg!
Klein
406900901_3_a
Klein
406900901_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Klein... I get the feeling we
should use our last resort here...
Akuto (Furinkazan Member)
406900901_1_a
Sinon
406900801_26_a
Asuna
406900801_25_a
Heh. What, indeed?
Kirito
406900801_24_a
K-dawg...! What've you got up
your sleeve?!
Klein
406900801_23_a
Those Card Soldiers had a flush.
They couldn't have beaten it...
Klein
406900801_22_a
Hmm... Huh. How did they?
Klein
406900801_21_a
H-Hey, Klein... How did they get
past that midpoint gate?
Akuto (Furinkazan Member)
406900801_20_a
You are, huh? And how are you
gonna do that with just the three
of you?
Klein
406900801_19_a
Sinon
406900801_18_a
Asuna
406900801_17_a
That's right. And that's why we're
going to repay the favor.
Kirito
406900801_16_a
Hey, come on. Friends we might be,
but we're rivals here.
Klein
406900801_15_a
Kirito
406900801_14_a
Yeah, you sent us all the way back
to the entrance. Not cool.
Sinon
406900801_13_a
Kirito
406900801_12_a
Sinon
406900801_11_a
Klein, you really did a mean thing
to us earlier.
Asuna
406900801_10_a
Oh, hey K-dawg!
You managed to make it this far?
Klein
406900801_9_a
We meet again, Klein.
???
406900801_8_a
That's right! We've gotta hoard
our big guns for the finale!
Klein
406900801_7_a
We don't know how tough the
labyrinth's last baddie is gonna
be. I think we're almost there.
Akuto (Furinkazan Member)
406900801_6_a
Yeah, we need to save that for
the final boss.
Akuto (Furinkazan Member)
406900801_5_a
The royal straight flush, right?
Akuto (Furinkazan Member)
406900801_4_a
Yeah, got it. But remember: don't
use those five, no matter what.
Klein
406900801_3_a
Klein
406900801_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Yo, Klein. We're starting to run
low on cards.
Akuto (Furinkazan Member)
406900801_1_a
The devs must have put this in
specifically to help small parties
hold their own in here!
Kirito
406900701_38_a
Wow...
Sinon
406900701_37_a
Wait...really?!
Asuna
406900701_36_a
No way!
Kirito
406900701_35_a
Since you managed to find me,
I'll give you a special present.
Joker
406900701_34_a
I guess our plan to sneak around
dark tunnels with a small party
worked out, huh, guys?
Asuna
406900701_33_a
To tell you the truth, I usually
avoid places where challengers
and the Card Soldiers loiter.
Joker
406900701_32_a
Few are lucky enough to see me in
this labyrinth. I'm something of a
hidden character, as it were.
Joker
406900701_31_a
My my, looks like I've been found.
Joker
406900701_30_a
You're the joker, aren't you!
Kirito
406900701_29_a
Well, let's go poke it and see
what happens. We're not getting
anywhere sitting here.
Sinon
406900701_28_a
Hopefully. I bet that joker's a
rare character and talking to it
will trigger an event!
Kirito
406900701_27_a
Jokers are usually treated as
special in most types of card
games. Maybe it can help us?
Sinon
406900701_26_a
Well, we haven't found any yet.
Asuna
406900701_25_a
You don't use the joker in poker.
Well, not normally, anyway.
Mostly in casual variants.
Kirito
406900701_24_a
The joker, of course!
It looks just like it!
Asuna
406900701_23_a
A clown? Is it the joker?
Kirito
406900701_22_a
Neither... What is that thing?
Not a card, by itself, black
cloak... A...clown?
Sinon
406900701_21_a
Who is it? Another party, or more
Card Soldiers?
Asuna
406900701_20_a
...
Asuna
406900701_19_a
Got it!
Kirito
406900701_18_a
Hide, quick!
Someone's coming!
Sinon
406900701_17_a
Sssh!
Sinon
406900701_16_a
But...what can we do? Three cards
can't be a flush, no matter how
hard we want it to be.
Asuna
406900701_15_a
They purposefully didn't explain
much about this area, but it can't
be impossible for three people.
Kirito
406900701_14_a
It's too early to give up. There's
gotta be some way to beat this.
Hmm... 
Kirito
406900701_13_a
I guess our game of hide and
collect can only get us so far.
Sinon
406900701_12_a
Okay, huddle up. What do we do?
Look for a teleporter, or find
another path?
Kirito
406900701_11_a
Oh no... But this labyrinth is
designed so that we HAVE to get
through there to keep going!
Asuna
406900701_10_a
We can only make three-card hands!
There's no way we can beat them!
Kirito
406900701_9_a
Yeah, they're all spades.
That means they have a flush.
Sinon
406900701_8_a
Wait... Oh no!
Kirito
406900701_7_a
We'll need to take them out to
keep going, but there's five of
them...
Kirito
406900701_6_a
And a bunch of Card Soldiers
guarding it too...
Asuna
406900701_5_a
Hmm, there's a gate blocking that
path.
Asuna
406900701_4_a
Kirito
406900701_3_a
Asuna
406900701_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Kirito, Asuna... Look.
Sinon
406900701_1_a
Sounds good.
Sinon
406900601_25_a
Ha ha ha, yeah. Mostly hiding,
sometimes fighting, and lots of
hoarding our good cards.
Kirito
406900601_24_a
It's like a game of hide
and...collect?
Asuna
406900601_23_a
I think we can play it quiet and
safe from here on out.
Sinon
406900601_22_a
Yeah. We've already got a lot of
cards stocked up from our fights
earlier.
Sinon
406900601_21_a
So we use our numerical
disadvantage to our tactical
advantage.
Kirito
406900601_20_a
Besides, there are only three of
us. That makes it easier to avoid
notice.
Asuna
406900601_19_a
That's a good point. This place is
riddled with places to hide.
Sinon
406900601_18_a
Instead, let's use this twisty
labyrinth to avoid any fight
that doesn't get us cards.
Kirito
406900601_17_a
So in other words, trying to brute
force our way through with
poker's a losing bet.
Kirito
406900601_16_a
But every time we play a hand, we
lose our cards. Worse, this whole
poker thing is pretty luck-based.
Kirito
406900601_15_a
and PvPing was the best strat
for this labyrinth...
Kirito
406900601_14_a
I've been thinking... At first,
it seemed like collecting cards,
fighting Card Soldiers,
Kirito
406900601_13_a
Yeah... That party certainly ran
fast. They knew they couldn't win.
Asuna
406900601_12_a
They had no choice but to turn
tail. Lose to the Card Soldiers,
and they're instantly unbeatable.
Sinon
406900601_11_a
We're lucky that party got tangled
up with those Card Soldiers,
then lost.
Asuna
406900601_10_a
Well, that worked.
Kirito
406900601_9_a
Got it.
Sinon
406900601_8_a
Yeah!
Asuna
406900601_7_a
But this is the 3D Labyrinth!
Let's find a place to hide on the
y-axis and see what happens!
Kirito
406900601_6_a
If this were a normal dungeon,
we'd be trapped...
Kirito
406900601_5_a
And we've got a bunch of Card
Soldiers bearing down on us from
up ahead!
Asuna
406900601_4_a
Kirito
406900601_3_a
Asuna
406900601_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Kirito, I see a five-person party
approaching from our six!
Sinon
406900601_1_a
Hmm...
Kirito
406900501_60_a
We'll have a much better chance of
winning if we can even the odds.
Asuna
406900501_59_a
So, do we grit our teeth and deal
with the disadvantage, or do we
find two more?
Asuna
406900501_58_a
Still, getting sent back to square
one every time you lose in PvP is
a pretty tough rule to play with.
Kirito
406900501_57_a
Klein may be our friend, but as
long as he's in another party,
he's a rival too.
Sinon
406900501_56_a
It's just how it is. The first
parties to beat this dungeon
get bonus loot.
Sinon
406900501_55_a
We got sent all the way back to
the entrance...
Asuna
406900501_54_a
bg_21_alne
sigh
...
Kirito
406900501_53_a
Sinon
406900501_52_a
Asuna
406900501_51_a
H-Hold up, Klein!
Kleeein!!
Kirito
406900501_50_a
Only three of you, but you never
know what sorta tricks K-dawg's
gonna pull... So take THIS!
Klein
406900501_49_a
Duh? That's the whole point of
the place. Now, huddle up, team.
What hand you guys wanna use...?
Klein
406900501_48_a
Sinon
406900501_47_a
Asuna
406900501_46_a
Wh-What?! No way!
You're planning on fighting us?!
Kirito
406900501_45_a
And the winning party gets to send
the losers all the way back to the
entrance!
Klein
406900501_44_a
This dungeon's got PvP poker
matches!
Klein
406900501_43_a
Kirito
406900501_42_a
Sinon
406900501_41_a
Huh? What do you mean?
Asuna
406900501_40_a
Seriously?! Ha ha ha! Aaanyway,
we're gonna send you packing.
No hard feelings, okay?
Klein
406900501_39_a
Sinon
406900501_38_a
Asuna
406900501_37_a
Y-Yeah, well... We didn't know
that when we came in, okay?
Kirito
406900501_36_a
There's only so much you can do
with a hand of three cards.
Klein
406900501_35_a
Yeah. But you guys are either
crazy brave or just crazy to come
in here like that.
Klein
406900501_34_a
Sinon
406900501_33_a
Asuna
406900501_32_a
Ahh, okay. I guess they set the
max player limit for poker rules.
Kirito
406900501_31_a
Taurus is chilling out alone in
Arun right now.
Klein
406900501_30_a
Yeah, but the max party size for
this place is five. What can ya
do, right?
Klein
406900501_29_a
Asuna
406900501_28_a
Kirito
406900501_27_a
Five? Aren't there six of you in
Furinkazan?
Sinon
406900501_26_a
You bet! The five of us are gonna
rock this thing like there's no
tomorrow!
Klein
406900501_25_a
Sinon
406900501_24_a
Asuna
406900501_23_a
Hey, Klein. You guys are here for
the dungeon too, I take it?
Kirito
406900501_22_a
Furinkazan, coming through! Ha ha!
Klein
406900501_21_a
Kirito
406900501_20_a
Sinon
406900501_19_a
Klein?!
Asuna
406900501_18_a
Dudes and dudettes! Whazzap!
???
406900501_17_a
True. But there's got to be
something here that can help
us level the playing field... 
Kirito
406900501_16_a
Maybe, but playing with three
cards in a poker match is like
shooting yourself in the foot.
Sinon
406900501_15_a
It let us in with three, so that
should mean smaller parties
can still beat this place...
Asuna
406900501_14_a
Har har. But, the game made us
declare how many people were in
our party when we came in, right?
Asuna
406900501_13_a
The deck is really stacked against
us, huh?
Kirito
406900501_12_a
We each only have one card slot,
so at best we've got three.
Kirito
406900501_11_a
Yeah. Poker hands are normally
five cards.
Kirito
406900501_10_a
It helps with recon, but doesn't
improve our hand. Actually, we're
two people short to really play.
Sinon
406900501_9_a
We can check their hand from far
away, so we don't have to worry
about them getting us.
Kirito
406900501_8_a
Your Cait Sith vision really
comes in handy here, Sinon.
Kirito
406900501_7_a
So this path is off limits to us.
Let's find another way around.
Asuna
406900501_6_a
They've got...a way better hand
than anything we can make right
now.
Sinon
406900501_5_a
You're right... I can see five
people...cards...? People cards?
Asuna
406900501_4_a
Kirito
406900501_3_a
Asuna
406900501_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Hold it, you two! I see Card
Soldiers up ahead!
Sinon
406900501_1_a
Most likely, yes. Now come on.
We're wasting time.
Sinon
406900401_15_a
You bet! I'm sure there are
certain areas that we'll need
a good hand to beat, too!
Asuna
406900401_14_a
Now that we know what we have to
do, let's get down to business!
Time to collect some cards!
Kirito
406900401_13_a
So we need to collect cards while
playing a meta poker game to
beat this dungeon.
Sinon
406900401_12_a
We should think about what to use
when, and save stronger cards to
beat tougher enemy hands.
Asuna
406900401_11_a
We'll need to go beat up monsters
to gather more cards...
Kirito
406900401_10_a
These cards are one-use only.
Good to know.
Sinon
406900401_9_a
Oh no! Mine's gone too!
Don't leave me, ace of hearts!
Asuna
406900401_8_a
That makes sense...
Wait! Where's my card?!
Kirito
406900401_7_a
We need to have a better hand
than the Card Soldiers we fight,
or else they're invincible.
Sinon
406900401_6_a
Naturally. The cards we equip in
these new slots form our poker
hand.
Sinon
406900401_5_a
Looks like your instincts were
correct, Sinon.
Kirito
406900401_4_a
Sinon
406900401_3_a
Kirito
406900401_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
We did it! We were finally able
to beat them!
Asuna
406900401_1_a
So this is some sort of
poker/battle hybrid!
Kirito
406900301_39_a
I hope they'll die now.
Sinon
406900301_38_a
I just saw a dispel effect hit
those Card Soldiers!
Asuna
406900301_37_a
Nooo! Do not fear!
Card Soldier
406900301_36_a
Wait... When did this turn into
poker?!
Asuna
406900301_35_a
Exactly. Our hand beats theirs.
We win!
Sinon
406900301_34_a
Ahhh, I get it now!
Kirito
406900301_33_a
Exactly. A pair! And we've got
a pair too...of aces!
Sinon
406900301_32_a
A three of clubs, a three of
spades, and the ace of diamonds?
Asuna
406900301_31_a
Look closely at those cards.
What are their numbers and suits?
Sinon
406900301_30_a
What is it, Sinonon?
Asuna
406900301_29_a
Hold it!
Sinon
406900301_28_a
I don't want to, but...
Kirito
406900301_27_a
There are three of them, just like
last time! Do we run?
Asuna
406900301_26_a
Oh man, these guys again?!
Kirito
406900301_25_a
Intruders!
Off with their heads!
Every last one!
???
406900301_24_a
...
Sinon
406900301_23_a
Each of us gets one, and a shiny
new slot to put it in...
Sinon
406900301_22_a
Maybe it'll help us beat this
dungeon?
Asuna
406900301_21_a
What's the story here? There's no
explanatory text or anything.
Kirito
406900301_20_a
Mine's in too. Ten of clubs.
Sinon
406900301_19_a
I just put my ace of hearts in
too.
Asuna
406900301_18_a
It's not a skill slot... Ooh!
The playing card fits!
Kirito
406900301_17_a
There's a new slot in my status
window.
Asuna
406900301_16_a
So we all got one...
Hmm, what's this?
Asuna
406900301_15_a
I got one as well.
The ace of spades!
Kirito
406900301_14_a
I got something too.
It's...a playing card.
Sinon
406900301_13_a
I'd say yes, but I'd rather not
humor you. Hmm... Looks like
it dropped something.
Asuna
406900301_12_a
Apparently, stabbing things kills
them. Who knew, huh?
Kirito
406900301_11_a
Oh yeah. Let's hit it with swords
and see if its HP goes down.
Kirito
406900301_10_a
And it's begging to die.
Sinon
406900301_9_a
That's just a normal monster!
Asuna
406900301_8_a
Graaawr!
???
406900301_7_a
Yikes, another enemy?!
Kirito
406900301_6_a
Hey, look! There's something over
there!
Sinon
406900301_5_a
Yeah, but that really took me by
surprise! How are we supposed to
kill them if they won't die?
Asuna
406900301_4_a
Sinon
406900301_3_a
Asuna
406900301_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Phew... Looks like those Card
Soldiers aren't following us.
Kirito
406900301_1_a
Good idea! Let's go!
Asuna
406900201_23_a
Let's fall back for now.
Luckily, it should be easy
to lose them in this maze.
Sinon
406900201_22_a
Charge! Chaaarge!!
Card Soldier
406900201_21_a
But...why would they be?
Kirito
406900201_20_a
Are they supposed to be
invincible?
Asuna
406900201_19_a
For sure. They've got almost no
health, but it's not going down.
Sinon
406900201_18_a
Something's off about these guys!
Kirito
406900201_17_a
Charge, and recharge!
Never falter, never fear!
Card Soldier
406900201_16_a
Then let's give them a warm
welcome!
Kirito
406900201_15_a
Uh oh, three of them are running
this way!
Asuna
406900201_14_a
Charge!
Card Soldier
406900201_13_a
Okay, that settles it. This is
definitely Alice in Wonderland
themed.
Kirito
406900201_12_a
Card Soldiers?!
Sinon
406900201_11_a
Over there!
Asuna
406900201_10_a
Huh?
Kirito
406900201_9_a
Intruders!
Off with their heads!!
???
406900201_8_a
Oof. This is not going to be a
walk in the park...
Kirito
406900201_7_a
I heard some paths teleport
you too. In other words, it's
impossible to know where you are.
Asuna
406900201_6_a
This labyrinth isn't just a
confusing, twisted 3D maze...
Asuna
406900201_5_a
You think so? From the outside,
it looked like it should take
us further in...
Kirito
406900201_4_a
Asuna
406900201_3_a
Kirito
406900201_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Kirito, I'm pretty sure that
vertical shaft leads to a dead
end.
Sinon
406900201_1_a
Yeah!
Asuna
406900101_25_a
There's going to be a lot of
people trying to beat it. Let's
try to be the first ones to do it!
Kirito
406900101_24_a
But remember: this is a
limited-time event dungeon
built inside the World Tree...
Kirito
406900101_23_a
Who knows? We'll have to head in
to find out.
Kirito
406900101_22_a
You think it really is based on
Alice in Wonderland?
Asuna
406900101_21_a
Clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds...
Yeah, it's got them all.
Sinon
406900101_20_a
You're right... The whole place
is filled with playing card
imagery.
Asuna
406900101_19_a
Ahh, I get it. They're going for
a Queen of Hearts' castle vibe,
from Alice in Wonderland.
Kirito
406900101_18_a
Those are pretty cool.
But this one's kinda...cute?
But also creepy somehow?
Kirito
406900101_17_a
Like a waterfall that falls
forever or stairs where you can't
tell if they're going up or down.
Asuna
406900101_16_a
Ooh, I've seen those. They use
perspective and visual tricks to
make things look...weird.
Asuna
406900101_15_a
Trick art, maybe? Those optical
illusion paintings?
Sinon
406900101_14_a
Just an armchair one...
Anyway, this place reminds
me of something... But what?
Kirito
406900101_13_a
Hehe, you sound like a dev
yourself. You're such a dork.
Asuna
406900101_12_a
The devs outdid themselves this
time. Reworking the inside of the
World Tree was a fantastic idea.
Kirito
406900101_11_a
But this is definitely impressive.
It's like a giant, 3D maze with
translucent glass walls.
Sinon
406900101_10_a
Well, ALO's got flight, so normal
dungeons are wasted potential.
Sinon
406900101_9_a
I don't think we've ever seen
anything like this before. It's
certainly not a standard dungeon.
Asuna
406900101_8_a
bg_event_wonderland
Whoa... So this is the 3D
Labyrinth? Awesome.
Kirito
406900101_7_a
Okay, we have to register our
party before we go in, so...
There, the three of us. Let's go!
Kirito
406900101_6_a
That's why we're here, isn't it?
Sinon
406900101_5_a
Yeah!
Asuna
406900101_4_a
Sinon
406900101_3_a
Asuna
406900101_2_a
bg_21_alne
Alright, it's the three of us
today. Let's do this dungeon!
Kirito
406900101_1_a
1K?
1K?
Hello? Anyone there?
Dyne
406801201_79_a
1K?
bg_s2_01_wilderness
...
Dyne
406801201_78_a
1K?
Kirito
406801201_77_a
1K?
Well, everything seems to have
worked out. Odd. I get the feeling
we're forgetting something.
Sinon
406801201_76_a
1K?
Orchis
406801201_75_a
1K?
Yeah, me too!
Epidanthia
406801201_74_a
1K?
Sinon
406801201_73_a
1K?
Ha ha, you got yourself a good
partner there. I'm looking forward
to playing more with both of you.
Kirito
406801201_72_a
1K?
That's right. And from here on
out, I'll be by your side,
Epidanthia.
Orchis
406801201_71_a
1K?
Ahaha... You're really good at
reading people, huh, Orchis?
Epidanthia
406801201_70_a
1K?
You must really like flowers,
Epidanthia.
Orchis
406801201_69_a
1K?
And the name you gave me was
"Orchis," of the same family as
the phragmipedium epidanthus.
Orchis
406801201_68_a
1K?
She did what...?
Epidanthia
406801201_67_a
1K?
Epidanthia... Did you take your
name from the flower,
phragmipedium epidanthus?
Orchis
406801201_66_a
1K?
N-No, there's just dust in my eye,
okay?! It's this stupid Monolith's
fault for being so gross!
Epidanthia
406801201_65_a
1K?
Epidanthia... Are you crying?
Orchis
406801201_64_a
1K?
Orchis
406801201_63_a
1K?
sniff
...
Epidanthia
406801201_62_a
1K?
Th-Thanks... I've...never had
anyone be so nice to me before...
Epidanthia
406801201_61_a
1K?
Yeah, and all the stuff that's
worth cash is yours. Sell it to
help your sick brother.
Kirito
406801201_60_a
1K?
I won't allow you to say no.
Besides, it's way more efficient
to party for rare hunting.
Sinon
406801201_59_a
1K?
Kiri-poo... Sinon...
Epidanthia
406801201_58_a
1K?
Oh! One more thing! You party with
us to explore the Monolith for a
little while. Deal?
Kirito
406801201_57_a
1K?
I get that you're hard for money
right now, but these contracts
you're doing sound dangerous.
Sinon
406801201_56_a
1K?
And every once in a while, you
stop with the money-making and
just play with us.
Sinon
406801201_55_a
1K?
There's one condition, though.
You have to friend us.
Sinon
406801201_54_a
1K?
Say whaaat?
Epidanthia
406801201_53_a
1K?
And since it's ours, we'd like to
give it to you.
Kirito
406801201_52_a
1K?
...
Epidanthia
406801201_51_a
1K?
Yeah, I know. Our deal's done,
so Orchis's ours.
Kirito
406801201_50_a
1K?
Yeah...
Hey, Kirito...
Sinon
406801201_49_a
1K?
Either way, it said it'd work for
me, so I can't just sell it off...
Epidanthia
406801201_48_a
1K?
It kinda reminds me of my little
brother. How much it likes me,
maybe? Or how pure it is?
Epidanthia
406801201_47_a
1K?
Orchis?
Well, I just met it, but...
Epidanthia
406801201_46_a
1K?
But then why were you thinking of
keeping that android for yourself?
Kirito
406801201_45_a
1K?
Exactly. And then this Monolith
appeared, and it became a total
gold mine.
Epidanthia
406801201_44_a
1K?
Yeah, we were able to fight
American players until just
recently...
Sinon
406801201_43_a
1K?
but then GGO decides to separate
servers by regions, so my revenue
stream dried up...
Epidanthia
406801201_42_a
1K?
It was like a money-making dream!
I was making bank with my big
overseas patrons until recently,
Epidanthia
406801201_41_a
1K?
When I heard about the real money
marketplace in GGO, I dived right
in and got hooked.
Epidanthia
406801201_40_a
1K?
But we run a FLORIST in the middle
of Podunk, Nowheresville. No way
we can afford that.
Epidanthia
406801201_39_a
1K?
The poor kid...
Kirito
406801201_38_a
1K?
My little brother's sick, and we
need to send him overseas to get
treated.
Epidanthia
406801201_37_a
1K?
Eh, whatever. You want my sob
story, you got it.
Epidanthia
406801201_36_a
1K?
sigh
...
Kiri-poo, is everyone you
know as nosy as you are?
Epidanthia
406801201_35_a
1K?
I've got one more demand. Tell us
why you're so obsessed with
making real cash in GGO.
Sinon
406801201_34_a
1K?
Ahaha, the latter. You don't want
me to break the rules for some
reason, so I'll humor you.
Epidanthia
406801201_33_a
1K?
Or hand over that android?
Kirito
406801201_32_a
1K?
So, Epidanthia. What'll it be? Get
fragged and lose a random item?
Kirito
406801201_31_a
1K?
Oh... Duh! I totally forgot about
that...
Epidanthia
406801201_30_a
1K?
The first surprise shot from a
sniper rifle doesn't display a
Bullet Line, remember?
Sinon
406801201_29_a
1K?
But why couldn't I see Sinon's
Bullet Line through you, Kiri-poo?
Epidanthia
406801201_28_a
1K?
Hey... I get why you wanted to try
to get up close and personal to
finish me off...
Epidanthia
406801201_27_a
1K?
Yup. Sniper charge. A deadly,
risky move, and one of our best
tricks. Remember it.
Sinon
406801201_26_a
1K?
There's no way I can handle both
of you if you're this close...
I lost, fair and square.
Epidanthia
406801201_25_a
1K?
Yiiikes, I surrender! I never
thought you'd have her--Sinon,
was it?--hiding behind your back.
Epidanthia
406801201_24_a
1K?
...
Epidanthia
406801201_23_a
1K?
Kirito
406801201_22_a
1K?
Checkmate.
Sinon
406801201_21_a
1K?
What?!
Epidanthia
406801201_20_a
1K?
Sinon
406801201_19_a
1K?
I don't mind! That's...my part
of the plan!!
Kirito
406801201_18_a
1K?
You'll die way before you reach
me!
Epidanthia
406801201_17_a
1K?
Ha ha ha, those bullets look like
they hurt! Your precious Photon
Sword can't deflect them all!
Epidanthia
406801201_16_a
1K?
Nngh!
Graaah!!
Kirito
406801201_15_a
1K?
You're trying to get in a surprise
attack?! You think I'll fall for
that?!
Epidanthia
406801201_14_a
1K?
Maybe... Maybe NOT!!
Hraaagh!!!
Kirito
406801201_13_a
1K?
I'm invincible, no matter what
sort of fight it is!
Epidanthia
406801201_12_a
1K?
Hmph, okay, so you got me pegged.
So what? You still can't beat me,
Kiri-poo!
Epidanthia
406801201_11_a
1K?
...
Epidanthia
406801201_10_a
1K?
Add to that a high-level STR/VIT
build, and no wonder you're an
elite solo player.
Kirito
406801201_9_a
1K?
We figured out why you're so good.
Extra-accurate Bullet Circles,
plus that Old Guard skill...
Kirito
406801201_8_a

Hehe, liar. I've had my eye on
that rock since you two hid back
there. She hasn't left it.
Epidanthia
406801201_7_a
1K?
Who can say? Maybe she already
slipped away?
Kirito
406801201_6_a

Heh, I see you decided to come out
and die like a good boy. So,
Kiri-poo... Where's your friend?
Epidanthia
406801201_5_a
1K?
...
Kirito
406801201_4_a

Next on the menu is Kiri-poo and
his girlfriend! I see you behind
that rock!
Epidanthia

Yay, gross old guy's dead!

Urrrgk!

406801201_1_a

Kirito
406801101_34_a
It's not the sort of skill you'd
earn if you were just playing for
a few larks and some cash...
Sinon
406801101_33_a
Well, you need to be a
ridiculously high level to
qualify for the Old Guard skill...
Sinon
406801101_32_a
So the secret to her strength
is that rare skill, plus her
unnatural calm.
Kirito
406801101_31_a
The rare skill...Old Guard!
Sinon
406801101_30_a
GGO's got one thing that lets you
reduce the burden of using hard
to wield antique guns!
Sinon
406801101_29_a
Uh...?
Kirito
406801101_28_a
They're all antique guns.
Which means...
Sinon
406801101_27_a
She's got a submachine gun too.
An MP 18.
Kirito
406801101_26_a
She's got a heavy machine-gun:
the Colt-Browning. Also, the
Winchester: a hunting rifle...
Sinon
406801101_25_a
Ah. I got it.
Sinon
406801101_24_a
So, how does she move so fast
carrying three huge guns...?
Wait a sec...
Sinon
406801101_23_a
I see what you're getting at.
She's moving way too fast,
even for a musclehead character.
Sinon
406801101_22_a
Okay, so plan A is bust. Plan B.
Question: how can she move so fast
with all that heavy equipment?
Kirito
406801101_21_a
I'm honestly jealous. She must
have a natural gift for
self-control.
Sinon
406801101_20_a
I said a whole bunch of stuff back
there in the hopes that I'd rattle
her, but looks like I failed.
Kirito
406801101_19_a
So the reason she's so accurate is
because she's always so calm
and collected.
Sinon
406801101_18_a
...are smaller the lower your
heart rate is.
Sinon
406801101_17_a
Just as I expected. The Bullet
Circles that pop up when the
aiming system assist kicks in...
Sinon
406801101_16_a
Sinon
406801101_15_a
Sinon, you've seen her aim at
close range. Thoughts?
Kirito
406801101_14_a
Bleck, I'm gonna be sick!
Epidanthia
406801101_13_a
Hey, don't have such a cow, gurl,
or nobody'll think your tots hots!
You dig?
Dyne
406801101_12_a
Well, you won't last a second
against me!
Epidanthia
406801101_11_a
Hey, gramps! You planning on
being a meatshield for those two?
Epidanthia
406801101_10_a
Kirito
406801101_9_a
Sinon
406801101_8_a
Yeah, yeah... Why do I always
get this job?
Dyne
406801101_7_a
Dyne, keep her busy for me!
Sinon
406801101_6_a
Dyne
406801101_5_a
Sinon
406801101_4_a
Yikes... That firing speed and
power's nothing to mess with!
Kirito
406801101_3_a
I'm at my most deadly at this
range! I'll blow you away with
my Colt-Browning!
Epidanthia
406801101_2_a
bg_s2_02_underground
I know you're hiding over there!
Epidanthia
406801101_1_a
iJ?

You got it!
Sinon
406801001_55_a
iJ?
Dyne
406801001_54_a
iJ?
Sinon
406801001_53_a
iJ?
So you'll fight us? Great!
Rematch time!
Sinon, let's do this!
Kirito
406801001_52_a
iJ?
Got it, Epidanthia.
Orchis
406801001_51_a
iJ?
Orchis! Go hide somewhere!
Your mistress's about to kick
some butt!
Epidanthia
406801001_50_a
iJ?
trQ
I won't stand for you jerks
insulting my skills like that,
either!
Epidanthia
406801001_49_a
iJ?
Orchis
406801001_48_a
iJ?
trQ
Okay, first of all, I'd never lose
to you idiots! Secondly, why would
I agree to your stupid plan?!
Epidanthia
406801001_47_a
iJ?
Then, we tell people it dropped
when we ganked you. That way,
you won't break your contract.
Sinon
406801001_46_a
iJ?
Well, we won't kill you if you
hand it over to us.
Sinon
406801001_45_a
iJ?
Dyne
406801001_44_a
iJ?
Kirito
406801001_43_a

The death penalty in GGO is harsh.
You die, you lose a random item.
Sinon

iJ?
Orchis
406801001_41_a
iJ?
Huh...?

iJ?
Dyne
406801001_38_a
iJ?
Alright... So, how about we
just say we killed you here and
stole it?
Kirito

iJ?
Orchis
406801001_36_a
iJ?
trQ
H-Hey, stick your noses in someone
else's business! I can do whatever
I want with the stuff I find!
Epidanthia
406801001_35_a
iJ?
He's right. Get too greedy, and
your employers might come for
your kneecaps.
Sinon
406801001_34_a
iJ?
That's why people are using
contracts now. If you're under
one, you'd best follow it.
Kirito
406801001_33_a
iJ?
Apparently, there's been a lot of
trouble over trades involving real
money in GGO lately.
Kirito
406801001_32_a
iJ?
...
Dyne
406801001_31_a
iJ?
Sinon
406801001_30_a
iJ?
Dyne
406801001_29_a
iJ?
I'd forget it if I were you.
Dyne here just filled me in
on some interesting stuff.
Kirito
406801001_28_a
iJ?
Oh. It's you losers.
Epidanthia
406801001_27_a
iJ?
Who's there?!
Epidanthia
406801001_26_a
iJ?
You're not planning on stealing
that for yourself too, Epidanthia?
???
406801001_25_a
iJ?
...
Epidanthia
406801001_24_a
iJ?
What would you like me to do?
Orchis
406801001_23_a
iJ?
Understood. My name is now Orchis.
Orchis
406801001_22_a
iJ?
Right, fine... Okay, your name
is...Orchis!
Epidanthia
406801001_21_a
iJ?
I will ask one more time.
Please, give me a name.
???
406801001_20_a
iJ?
What do I want to do...?
Epidanthia
406801001_19_a
iJ?
Please, tell me. What is it that
you wish to do?
???
406801001_18_a
iJ?
Epidanthia. Understood. From here
on, I will do whatever I can to
assist you.
???
406801001_17_a
iJ?
Eh, whatever.
I'm Epidanthia.
Epidanthia
406801001_16_a
iJ?
In addition, please tell me your
name, mistress.
???
406801001_15_a
iJ?
A name...? Why would I do that?
I'm not your real owner or
anything.
Epidanthia
406801001_14_a
iJ?
Mistress, will you please give me
a name?
???
406801001_13_a
iJ?
I bet I can get a ton of cash
for it...
Epidanthia
406801001_12_a
iJ?
Wowie... I never thought I'd find
anything like this in here...
Epidanthia
406801001_11_a
iJ?
My designation is MHCR:
Mental Health Counseling Robot.
I am pleased to meet you.
???
406801001_10_a
iJ?
I am an android assigned to this
spaceship. My purpose is to offer
emotional support to its crew.
???
406801001_9_a
iJ?
Whaaat! It spoke!
Epidanthia
406801001_8_a
iJ?
Are you...my mistress?
???
406801001_7_a
iJ?
An android? I've never seen
anything like this before.
Epidanthia
406801001_6_a
iJ?
Epidanthia
406801001_5_a
iJ?
...
???
406801001_4_a
iJ?
Hmm... This is...
Epidanthia
406801001_3_a
iJ?
Great! Now, let's see what sorta
expensive-looking treasures I can
scrounge up...
Epidanthia
406801001_2_a
iJ?
bg_s2_02_underground
This totally feels like the
Monolith's deepest, darkest
place. Ooo, scary.
Epidanthia
406801001_1_a
Ah... Er...
Nah, not exactly.
Haha. Hah.
Kirito
406800901_37_a
But Kirito...
Are you really a chick?
Dyne
406800901_36_a
Hey, I know we're having a
serious conversation here...
Dyne
406800901_35_a
Hmm... I guess I can see that...
Sinon
406800901_34_a
She seems more like the type who'd
hang out in the mall with friends
or go to parties.
Kirito
406800901_33_a
Anyway... At a glance, she doesn't
seem the type to get into games.
Especially hardcore VR shooters.
Kirito
406800901_32_a
N-No! How was I flirting?! And
what do you mean, "again"?! 
Kirito
406800901_31_a
Do you want me to go tell Asuna
you're flirting behind her back
again?!
Sinon
406800901_30_a
H-Hey, Kirito! Why are you taking
this random girl's side here!
Sinon
406800901_29_a
Good point. Most of GGO's players
are older guys. We don't have many
girls
younger ones, especially.
Dyne
406800901_28_a
I don't think an average high
school girl after pocket money
would obsess over GGO that much.
Kirito
406800901_27_a
She knows the game inside and out,
has a plan for every situation,
and is a killer solo player.
Kirito
406800901_26_a
Yeah, she did. But think about it.
She's walking around with three
specialized guns.
Kirito
406800901_25_a
Hmph. Did she tell you that
during one of your little chats?
Sinon
406800901_24_a
I don't think she's playing GGO
just to make a few bucks,
no matter what she says...
Kirito
406800901_23_a
I...get you there, Sinon.
But that girl...
Kirito
406800901_22_a
Even still. I can't forgive myself
for losing to some idiot just
playing GGO for cash.
Sinon
406800901_21_a
Besides, pro gaming's a thing now,
and isn't that basically the same
as working?
Dyne
406800901_20_a
Hey, easy there, Sinon. Everyone
plays for a different reason.
Dyne
406800901_19_a
Bah, she annoys me. Using GGO
like some sort of part-time job.
The nerve!
Sinon
406800901_18_a
If she's that skilled of a solo
player, she must be making bank.
Dyne
406800901_17_a
W-We just had a chat or two...
I'm a bit worried about her
obsession with money...
Kirito
406800901_16_a
Hmph... You've certainly learned
a lot about her all of a sudden.
Care to elaborate on how?
Sinon
406800901_15_a
Epidanthia looks like a gaudy
pushover, but she's one insanely
skilled player...
Kirito
406800901_14_a
She's got guns for close-range,
mid-range, and long-range combat,
and she's tough as nails...
Kirito
406800901_13_a
How did she hit me?! A Winchester
is far less accurate than my
Hecate...
Sinon
406800901_12_a
ZZ.
She used that antique?!
Dyne
406800901_11_a
A Winchester?!
Sinon
406800901_10_a
You won't believe it...
Kirito
406800901_9_a
Yeah, and it seriously stung.
What did that crazy girl shoot
me with?
Sinon
406800901_8_a
Yeah, barely... But what about
Sinon?! Didn't she just get hit?!
Kirito
406800901_7_a
Oh, Kirito! You're OK!
Dyne
406800901_6_a
Sinon!
Kirito
406800901_5_a
Yeah... Somehow...
Sinon
406800901_4_a
Sinon, are you okay?!
Dyne
406800901_3_a
Dyne
406800901_2_a
bg_s2_11_cave
Owww...
Sinon
406800901_1_a
Urk...
Kirito
406800801_18_a
Ooo, that looked like it hurt.
You miiight want to go give
your friend some CPR.
Epidanthia
406800801_17_a
...
Kirito
406800801_16_a
Boom. Headshot!
Epidanthia
406800801_15_a
But any old-timey gun like this in
MY hands becomes a deadly weapon
of doom!
Epidanthia
406800801_14_a
Hehe, it's waaay older than
anything your friend's using...
Epidanthia
406800801_13_a
That's...a sniper rifle!
Hold on... A hunting rifle?!
Kirito
406800801_12_a
She's changing weapons again...?!
Kirito
406800801_11_a
One silly little sniper shot to
the face can't stop me!
Epidanthia
406800801_10_a
Hehehe... I'm a total STR/VIT
build, duh.
Epidanthia
406800801_9_a
What?! You can still stand, even
after getting sniped by Sinon?!
Kirito
406800801_8_a
You're a pretty good tactician,
Kiri-poo...
Epidanthia
406800801_7_a
I-I see... You were buying time
until your friends got here to
snipe me...
Epidanthia
406800801_6_a
I didn't have to say a word.
She knew I wanted her to snipe
you just by watching me!
Kirito
406800801_5_a
Nice shot! That's my Sinon!
Kirito
406800801_4_a
Nngh... Urk...
Gak...!
Epidanthia
406800801_3_a
bg_s2_11_cave
...
Epidanthia
406800801_1_a
...
Kirito
406800701_41_a
Hmm... I know that look! You're
thinking of some sort of sneaky
plan!
Epidanthia
406800701_40_a
If only Sinon were close enough to
hear all this gunfire...
Kirito
406800701_39_a
But I can't win just by dodging...
Kirito
406800701_38_a
I know how good of a marksman I
am, but you're somehow avoiding
my shots.
Epidanthia
406800701_37_a
Kiri-poo, you really are
incredible.
Epidanthia
406800701_36_a
I need to get closer! But...how
do I do that when she's spraying
a thousand bullets a second?!
Kirito
406800701_35_a
Sinon
406800701_34_a
R-Roger that! Let's go.
Dyne
406800701_33_a
Nobody could climb out of a hole
that deep. I bet Kirito's already
looking for another way out.
Sinon
406800701_32_a
We're not waiting here for Kirito?
Dyne
406800701_31_a
Let's check it out.
Sinon
406800701_30_a
It's coming from over there!
Dyne
406800701_29_a
Dyne
406800701_28_a
Gunfire!
Sinon
406800701_27_a
Epidanthia
406800701_26_a
Urk...
Kirito
406800701_25_a
Now bring it, Kirito! I'm gonna
fill you full of lead!
Epidanthia
406800701_24_a
The granddaddy of all submachine
guns: the MP 18!
Epidanthia
406800701_23_a
A submachine gun?!
Kirito
406800701_22_a
Hehe... I've got close combat
equipment too! Check THIS out!
Epidanthia
406800701_21_a
I'm down for a duel, but you sure
you want to fight me? Your gun
won't help you if I'm this close.
Kirito
406800701_20_a
So, our temporary truce is over.
Wanna shoot each other and see
what happens?!
Epidanthia
406800701_19_a
...
Kirito
406800701_18_a
Great, then we're done talking
about this! I get enough of that
morality crap in real life!
Epidanthia
406800701_17_a
H-Hey, I'm not trying to tell you
how to live your life, but-
Kirito
406800701_16_a
Ugh, what are you, the police?
Get off my back. I hate
do-gooders.
Epidanthia
406800701_15_a
Stealing sounds like trouble...
And have you talked to your
parents about this "job"?
Kirito
406800701_14_a
This sounds...too good to be true.
Kirito
406800701_13_a
Better yet, they pay me just for
exploring the Monolith-plus extra
for whatever I find!
Epidanthia
406800701_12_a
They pay for all my consumables,
and they'll even buy me anything
I say I need for the job.
Epidanthia
406800701_11_a
It'll be fine, as long as no one
finds out! Besides, my patrons
are too nice for their own good.
Epidanthia
406800701_10_a
You're planning on breaking
your contract?
Kirito
406800701_9_a
Welll, my contract says that I've
gotta hand over everything I find.
Epidanthia
406800701_8_a
Steal...? Is that a good idea?
Kirito
406800701_7_a
Half, maybe? I'll steal anything
that looks like it might come in
handy.
Epidanthia
406800701_6_a
You're planning on selling your
whole haul to the patrons
sponsoring you, right?
Kirito
406800701_5_a
Yeah, and I found a ton of rare
stuff down there too! It must be
my lucky day!
Epidanthia
406800701_4_a
Fresh air! Or, whatever passes for
it here. At least we're not
trapped in the Monolith anymore.
Kirito
406800701_3_a
Kirito
406800701_2_a
bg_s2_11_cave
Oooh, we're out!
Epidanthia
406800701_1_a
C-Cool... Sinon did NOT take that
particular revelation this well...
Kirito
406800601_31_a
Hmph, lame! Eh, I guess I don't
really care, though.
Epidanthia
406800601_30_a
Err, I never had the chance to
tell you, but despite the avatar,
I'm a guy.
Kirito
406800601_29_a
You're wasting all that sexy
avatar's potential!
Epidanthia
406800601_28_a
Awww, little Kiri-poo! I love it,
but isn't that a guy's name? And
huh, you talk like a guy too.
Epidanthia
406800601_27_a
K-Kirito...
Kirito
406800601_26_a
Hyah hah hah! Relax, dummy!
I'm just kidding with you...
Hey, what's your name?
Epidanthia
406800601_25_a
Umm... I'm...not sure how to
react to that...
Kirito
406800601_24_a
If girls our age want to make real
cash real quick in the real world,
it's illegal stuff or bust.
Epidanthia
406800601_23_a
I mean, it's waaay easier to make
cash here than with some two-bit
part-time job irl, right?
Epidanthia
406800601_22_a
Like, duh? Isn't that basically
the whole point of this game?
Epidanthia
406800601_21_a
Do you spend all your time in GGO
trying to make cash?
Kirito
406800601_20_a
Of course, I'd make you pay me for
the privilege! Ha ha ha!
Epidanthia
406800601_19_a
If you don't know how to do it,
I could teach you.
Epidanthia
406800601_18_a
I've never really gotten into real
money trading myself. Well,
I guess indirectly, but...
Kirito
406800601_17_a
Seriously, though, GGO's such an
awesome game! I love how easy it
is to make real bucks here!
Epidanthia
406800601_16_a
S-Sure, I guess...
Kirito
406800601_15_a
So... You seem decent enough. Want
to team up until we get out of
here?
Epidanthia
406800601_14_a
...
Kirito
406800601_13_a
Ahaha, everyone always says that!
Eh, I don't really care to keep
net me and real me separate.
Epidanthia
406800601_12_a
Uh, you might not want to just
blab about who you are in the
real world, then?
Kirito
406800601_11_a
Once all those creepy old guys
learn I'm a high school girl, they
go all pervert on me. Bleck.
Epidanthia
406800601_10_a
I know that GGO's all about
teamwork, but that's lame,
and everyone here's an old fart.
Epidanthia
406800601_9_a
Duh! I wanna hog all the sweet
loot for myself, after all!
Epidanthia
406800601_8_a
You're...planning on soloing this
area?
Kirito
406800601_7_a
I'd watch my back if I were you!
Epidanthia
406800601_6_a
Then agaaain, who knows just what
I'll do? Heh heh heh...
Epidanthia
406800601_5_a
Hey, relax. I'm not crazy enough
to start a PvP firefight in this
ridiculous situation.
Epidanthia
406800601_4_a
Seriously?!
Kirito
406800601_3_a
Kirito
406800601_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Sooo, what to do with you...
Epidanthia
406800601_1_a
uH?
uH?
...
Kirito
406800501_45_a
uH?
Like, duh? Otherwise why would I
save some random stranger?
Epidanthia
406800501_44_a
uH?
You were going to extort him for
real money?!
Kirito
406800501_43_a
uH?
Well, I waaas planning on making
him pay for the help. In real cash,
too. Mmm, tasty.
Epidanthia
406800501_42_a
uH?
You killed most of them, but were
planning on saving that survivor?
Kirito
406800501_41_a
uH?
But that giant thing spawned on
top of me, and the floor went
bye-bye. What an annoying gimmick.
Epidanthia
406800501_40_a
uH?
Yup yup! Well, I was gonna help
that one hurt survivor. Play the
gallant hero and all.
Epidanthia
406800501_39_a
uH?
You mean... You were the one who
took out everyone up there?
Kirito
406800501_38_a
uH?
You can never let your guard down,
can you?
Epidanthia
406800501_37_a
uH?
And I'd gone through all the
effort of clearing out the other
players up there, too. Lame.
Epidanthia
406800501_36_a
uH?
That's my name, don't wear it out!
Ha ha ha, that monster dropped you
down here too, huh?
Epidanthia
406800501_35_a
uH?
Epidanthia...?!
Kirito
406800501_34_a
uH?
Hey, I remember you!
You fell too?
???
406800501_33_a
uH?
sigh
I can't even see where
I fell from. Guess I can't climb
out of here...
Kirito
406800501_32_a
uH?
I fell pretty far... If this
was real life, I'd be dead
for sure.
Kirito
406800501_31_a
uH?
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Owww...
Kirito
406800501_30_a
uH?
Dyne
406800501_29_a
uH?
Kiritooo!!
Sinon
406800501_28_a
uH?
Nngh! Sinon!
Save him!
Kirito
406800501_27_a
uH?
The ground's buckling...?
Oh no, the floor's going to
collapse!
Kirito
406800501_26_a
uH?
What the...?! Why'd this giant
thing have to spawn right on top
of us!
Kirito
406800501_25_a
uH?
Grrraaawr!!
Monster
406800501_24_a
uH?
Really?!
Kirito
406800501_23_a
uH?
Dyne
406800501_22_a
uH?
Kirito! Watch out!!
Sinon
406800501_21_a
uH?
Kirito
406800501_20_a
uH?
Yeah, she shouted her name at
me for some reason before
disappearing...
Player C
406800501_19_a
uH?
A machine-gun...?
Was her name Epidanthia?
Kirito
406800501_18_a
uH?
In a heartbeat, she and the
monster were both gone. Poof.
Vanished.
Player C
406800501_17_a
uH?
It was about to finish me off
when this little girl with a giant
machine-gun jumps in, and BANG!
Player C
406800501_16_a
uH?
Really, now? And where is this
monster now?
Kirito
406800501_15_a
uH?
N-No, a monster got me...
An insanely powerful mob spawns
in this area of the Monolith...
Player C
406800501_14_a
uH?
You got taken out in PvP?
Kirito
406800501_13_a
uH?
Y-Yeah... But I can't go any
further like this...
Player C
406800501_12_a
uH?
Hey, are you all right?
Kirito
406800501_11_a
uH?
Sinon
406800501_9_a
uH?
But we can't just ignore him!
Kirito
406800501_8_a
uH?
Dyne
406800501_10_a
uH?
True. That player could be
feigning injury while his buddies
lurk nearby to ambush us.
Dyne
406800501_7_a
uH?
Kirito, wait! It could be a trap!
Sinon
406800501_6_a
uH?
Someone's injured over there!
Kirito
406800501_5_a
uH?
Dyne
406800501_4_a
uH?
Sinon
406800501_3_a
uH?
Kirito
406800501_2_a
uH?
bg_s2_11_cave
Nnngh...
Player C
406800501_1_a
Hey, look!
Dyne
406800401_29_a
Maybe they all killed each other
off?
Kirito
406800401_28_a
Yeah. But I don't hear any shouts
of triumph. I don't hear anything
at all.
Sinon
406800401_27_a
So the PvP battle royale's
over, huh?
Dyne
406800401_26_a
Yeah. All those firefights around
us have disappeared.
Kirito
406800401_25_a
You haven't noticed?
It's quiet. Too quiet.
Sinon
406800401_24_a
S-Sooo, girls...? What's with the
furrowed brows and the silence...?
Dyne
406800401_23_a
...
Sinon
406800401_22_a
...
Kirito
406800401_21_a
For sure.
Kirito
406800401_20_a
Anyway, let's keep an eye out for
her. I get the feeling she'll be
trouble.
Sinon
406800401_19_a
Some people. Right.
Sinon
406800401_18_a
Ha ha ha. Well, some people just
like soloing, right?
Kirito
406800401_17_a
Specialists like her usually need
a squad to really excel. Too many
weaknesses to solo.
Sinon
406800401_16_a
Either way, she's got the guts to
try to take this place on all by
her lonesome. I'm impressed.
Sinon
406800401_15_a
Yeah...
Kirito
406800401_14_a
Raising your strength doesn't
change your outward appearance,
after all.
Sinon
406800401_13_a
Well, this is VR. Appearances
can be deceiving.
Sinon
406800401_12_a
It's hard to believe that delicate
little slip of a girl was all
STR/VIT...
Dyne
406800401_11_a
Well, some players do go with a
STR/VIT build. It's possible.
Sinon
406800401_10_a
You mean she actually ran?
Carrying something as heavy
as that machine-gun?!
Dyne
406800401_9_a
She did what...?
Sinon
406800401_8_a
Yeah. And you should've seen the
speed at which she sprinted out of
here, too...
Kirito
406800401_7_a
She didn't look it, but she
must've been a veteran fighter.
Sinon
406800401_6_a
She even noticed that I was
packing explosive bullets as a
backup plan. She's sharp.
Kirito
406800401_5_a
Yeah, obviously. Are you an idiot
or something?
Sinon
406800401_4_a
Y-Yeah... Turns out it's
impossible to suicide charge
a machine-gun nest.
Kirito
406800401_3_a
Dyne
406800401_2_a
bg_s2_11_cave
Kirito! Are you okay?!
Sinon
406800401_1_a
...!
Kirito
406800301_52_a
My name is Epidanthia!
Remember it!
???
406800301_51_a
Really?!
Kirito
406800301_50_a
Eh, whatever. You fight funny,
so I'll let you go.
???
406800301_49_a
Urk...!
Kirito
406800301_48_a
Waaait a sec... Ahh, I see.
You're trying to trick me.
Get me to lower my guard?
???
406800301_47_a
...
Kirito
406800301_46_a
Hmm? You're giving up? Well,
glad you know when you're beat.
???
406800301_45_a
I can't win unless I get close...
So do what you will with me.
Kirito
406800301_44_a
Yeah, but it looks like that's not
going to happen.
Kirito
406800301_43_a
Ahahahaha! You're ridiculous! You
thought you could stop the entire
salvo with your Photon Sword?
???
406800301_42_a
Urk, that's far more bullets than
I expected... I can't deflect all
of these!
Kirito
406800301_41_a
Kirito
406800301_40_a
Hrrraaagh!!
???
406800301_39_a
Dyne
406800301_38_a
Wait, Kirito!!
Sinon
406800301_37_a
I'll be back in a jiffy!
Kirito
406800301_36_a
Well, it should be easy to take
out if I get in close, right?
Kirito
406800301_35_a
I think it's a Colt-Browning.
A really old gun, actually.
Sinon
406800301_34_a
Yup. Incredibly heavy by the looks
of it, too. Far more so than my
Hecate II or a Gatling gun.
Sinon
406800301_33_a
Dyne
406800301_32_a
Sinon
406800301_31_a
That's...a heavy machine-gun?
Kirito
406800301_30_a
You girls are pretty cute, though.
I'll let you live if you get out
of the Monolith right now.
???
406800301_29_a
Sinon
406800301_28_a
Kirito
406800301_27_a
ZZ.
Yikes... Foul mouth on that one...
Dyne
406800301_26_a
You gross me out, gramps!
Stay way over there, or I'll
blow your brains out!
???
406800301_25_a
Kirito
406800301_24_a
Whoa there! What a pretty little
lady!
Dyne
406800301_23_a
Dyne
406800301_22_a
Sinon
406800301_21_a
She's the sniper!
Kirito
406800301_20_a
You must be pretty good to avoid
my attacks!
???
406800301_19_a
Kirito
406800301_18_a
There!
Dyne
406800301_17_a
Bah... A sniper's got us in their
sights!
Sinon
406800301_16_a
Whoa!
Kirito
406800301_15_a
Not gonna happen!
???
406800301_14_a
Ha ha ha! Count me in on that
plan!
Dyne
406800301_13_a
Let's slip ahead while the idiots
are having their firefight.
Sinon
406800301_12_a
Isn't it obvious? We're not
wasting items and energy on
these losers.
Sinon
406800301_11_a
How do you want to play this?
Kirito
406800301_10_a
Ah. PvP. Everyone's trying to gun
down the competition for the
loot...
Kirito
406800301_9_a
Looks like it. Monsters spawn in
these ruins, but no one's willing
to work together to take 'em out.
Dyne
406800301_8_a
Looks like the party's started.
Sinon
406800301_7_a
What was that?! Someone's
screaming! And I hear gunfire!
Kirito
406800301_6_a
Rrraaagh!!
Player B
406800301_5_a
Dyne
406800301_4_a
Sinon
406800301_3_a
Kirito
406800301_2_a
bg_s2_11_cave
Grrragh!
Player A
406800301_1_a
IG?
IG?
Yeah!
Kirito
406800201_30_a
IG?
You got it! So come on, ladies!
Let's get scavenging!
Dyne
406800201_29_a
IG?
In other words, if we waste any
more time, all that loot's going
to get snatched right up.
Sinon
406800201_28_a
IG?
Dude...!
Kirito
406800201_27_a
IG?
GGO supports real money trading,
right? Well, some people pay real
cash to sponsor treasure hunters.
Dyne
406800201_26_a
IG?
What?
Sinon
406800201_25_a
IG?
You bet. They're all after that
rare loot, and who can blame
them? Besides...
Dyne
406800201_24_a
IG?
I see them... A lot of people must
be dying to plunder this place.
Sinon
406800201_23_a
IG?
Cool... Oh, hey. Looks like we're
not the only ones here.
Kirito
406800201_22_a
IG?
It looked like a big ol' slab of
rock, so "monolith." Makes
sense, right?
Dyne
406800201_21_a
IG?
Yup, that's what people are
calling it.
Dyne
406800201_20_a
IG?
Monolith?
Sinon
406800201_19_a
IG?
Rumor has it this SBC Monolith
is filled to the brim with sweet
loot. Mmm, loot.
Dyne
406800201_18_a
IG?
Yeah, that's the idea. I hear
there are nice rares and treasure
in there, and I want 'em.
Dyne
406800201_17_a
IG?
Oh, by the way! We just have to
back you up while you explore this
area, right, Dyne?
Kirito
406800201_16_a
IG?
Uh...?
Dyne
406800201_15_a
IG?
Oh, quiet, you!
This is all your fault!
Kirito
406800201_14_a
IG?
Wow, that was creepy.
Sinon
406800201_13_a
IG?
Oh, really...? Hah. Ha ha.
How...odd... Tee hee.
Kirito
406800201_12_a
IG?
Hey, Kirito? You know, your voice
sounds kinda...boyish? Not trying
to be mean, it just surprised me.
Dyne
406800201_11_a
IG?
Huh. I guess it's all dilapidated
because it's been abandoned for
so long.
Kirito
406800201_10_a
IG?
the sand got blown away and
revealed the dome of this ship.
That's the story, anyway.
Sinon
406800201_9_a
IG?
But when a couple of small squads
got into a gunfight around here,
Sinon
406800201_8_a
IG?
It's been covered by sand forever,
so people thought it was just a
big dune.
Sinon
406800201_7_a
IG?
It's a bit smaller, though, and
waaay more broken down...
Kirito
406800201_6_a
IG?
Yup, that's right.
Dyne
406800201_5_a
IG?
Giant spaceship? Is it an SBC,
like the Glocken?
Kirito
406800201_4_a
IG?
Sinon
406800201_3_a
IG?
Kirito
406800201_2_a
IG?
bg_s2_01_wilderness
Alright, we're here. This is that
new giant spaceship I found.
Dyne
406800201_1_a
What are you two ladies whispering
about? Come on, let's hit the
road! I'm your escort today!
Dyne
406800101_26_a
Gah! "Easier"?! What does that
even mean?! Brief me on this
stuff beforehand, okay?!
Kirito
406800101_25_a
No. He made that mistake on his
own. I just thought it'd be
easier not to correct him.
Sinon
406800101_24_a
Cute...girls? W-Wait a sec! Sinon!
Did you tell him I'm a girl?!
Kirito
406800101_23_a
Heh heh, I'm glad I got two cute
girls on my team today! Feels
good, yee-haw!
Dyne
406800101_22_a
Whoa! If it isn't Kirito!
Dyne
406800101_21_a
Hey...
Sinon
406800101_20_a
Kirito
406800101_19_a
Sinon
406800101_18_a
bg_event_ggo_pub
Yo, Sinon. I've been waiting so
long, I thought you stood me up!
Dyne
406800101_17_a
...
Sinon
406800101_16_a
Wow, it's been forever since we've
played GGO.
Kirito
406800101_15_a
You'll...find out when we get
there.
Sinon
406800101_14_a
Uhh, I don't like the sound of
that. What's the deal?
Kirito
406800101_13_a
...Sort of.
Sinon
406800101_12_a
Didn't Dyne say it's cool
if I join?
Kirito
406800101_11_a
I'm in too. I'll check with Dyne
if you can come.
Sinon
406800101_10_a
Alright, let's do it. It'll be fun
to convert over again. That is,
if I'm invited.
Kirito
406800101_9_a
We haven't been playing much GGO
lately, have we? It's all ALO,
ALO, ALO.
Kirito
406800101_8_a
He said he found a new area in GGO
and wanted my help exploring it.
Sinon
406800101_7_a
Yeah, that's him.
Sinon
406800101_6_a
Dyne...? Oh yeah, that middle-aged
guy who lost to Pale Rider in the
BoB.
Kirito
406800101_5_a
I just got a message from Dyne.
Sinon
406800101_4_a
For you, Sinon, sure. What's up?
Kirito
406800101_3_a
Kirito
406800101_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Kirito, do you have a minute?
Sinon
406800101_1_a
You can say that again!
Asuna
406701201_24_a
You're very welcome! But this
victory is thanks to ALL the red
team players' hard work!
Yui
406701201_23_a
Thanks for your advice, Yui!
Asuna
406701201_22_a
I cast that debuff spell in the
nick of time.
Asuna
406701201_21_a
Hahaha, I bet. I'm glad we eked
out a win, too!
Asuna
406701201_20_a
I see... Oh, I'm so glad we won!
It was so nerve-wracking to watch
you and Leafa neck-and-neck!
Yui
406701201_19_a
Seems like it.
Asuna
406701201_18_a
So the three players carrying them
were wearing the shoes then?
Yui
406701201_17_a
...to get them into first, so they
brought them out earlier than
planned for the chicken fight.
Asuna
406701201_16_a
They weren't going to use them
till the relay, but winning the
relay wasn't going to be enough...
Asuna
406701201_15_a
Yeah. They knew they'd have no
chance if they couldn't keep the
shoes secret till the last minute.
Asuna
406701201_14_a
Wow, they really thought of
everything...
Yui
406701201_13_a
So Leafa disguised them with some
special magic she'd learned so
nobody would notice.
Asuna
406701201_12_a
And on top of that, they lose
their effect as soon as they get
hit by a debuff.
Asuna
406701201_11_a
But they have a pretty unique
design that stands out like a
sore thumb.
Asuna
406701201_10_a
They told me all about how Liz
made a special pair of shoes
that buffed speed.
Asuna
406701201_9_a
Her shoes? That was their secret
weapon?
Yui
406701201_8_a
I only won because I cast it on
Leafa's shoes and dispelled their
speed buff!
Asuna
406701201_7_a
I'm glad you told me to get the
debuff ready before I left, Yui!
Asuna
406701201_6_a
You did it, Mommy!
Yui
406701201_5_a
Yui
406701201_4_a
Woohoo!!
Asuna
406701201_3_a
...is the red team!
Announcer
406701201_2_a
bg_event_grounds
There we have it, folks! With all
said and done, the team that
won the relay and the day...
Announcer
406701201_1_a
But don't worry, I'm not casting
it on you--just your shoes!
Asuna
406701101_39_a
Then I was right! Let's see how
you like this debuff!
Asuna
406701101_38_a
But it's too late! I can't lose
with the finish line only a few
feet away!
Leafa
406701101_37_a
Asuna
406701101_36_a
Hehe... The look on your face
tells me you finally figured it
out, Asuna!
Leafa
406701101_35_a
Unless... Unless they faked
their appearance!
Asuna
406701101_34_a
But Leafa's shoes look like the
basic ones found all over ALO...
Asuna
406701101_33_a
Could Liz have created some sort
of special footwear?
Asuna
406701101_32_a
Wait... Shoes... Equipment?!
Asuna
406701101_31_a
...
Asuna
406701101_30_a
Why am I thinking about that
right now all of a sudden?
Asuna
406701101_29_a
Then they ended up banning those
kinds of shoes from the
event anyway...
Asuna
406701101_28_a
Mom wouldn't stop complaining
about how if I couldn't win on my
own merits, it didn't count...
Asuna
406701101_27_a
I remember buying special shoes
to help me run faster for a sports
meet in the real world...
Asuna
406701101_26_a
...
Asuna
406701101_25_a
Yui
406701101_24_a
Okay... If I notice anything
suspicious, I'll fire off the
debuff!
Asuna
406701101_23_a
The only problem is that we don't
know what it is...
Yui
406701101_22_a
Yes, but it's also true they're
using SOMETHING to aid them.
Yui
406701101_21_a
But I thought you said debuffs
didn't work on whatever secret
weapon they're using?
Asuna
406701101_20_a
Remember to ready that debuff
spell during the relay, Mommy.
Just in case.
Yui
406701101_19_a
Win or lose, I'm gonna give this
everything I've got!
Asuna
406701101_18_a
Yui
406701101_17_a
Yui, I won't let you down.
Asuna
406701101_16_a
Yui!
Asuna
406701101_15_a
Mommyyyyyy!! I believe in yooou!!
Yui
406701101_14_a
There's no way I'll catch up to
her in time!
Asuna
406701101_13_a
I can't believe how fast Leafa
is...!
Asuna
406701101_12_a
The baton has been passed to the
team's anchor, Asuna!
Announcer
406701101_11_a
And red is in second, only a few
meters shy of white!
Announcer
406701101_10_a
Grrr...!
Asuna
406701101_9_a
Leafa
406701101_8_a
Hehe, you got this, Leafa!
Liz
406701101_7_a
Way to go, Liz!
I'll take it from here!
Leafa
406701101_6_a
The red team isn't far behind,
trying to reclaim the lead as Liz
hands the baton off to Leafa!
Announcer
406701101_5_a
And in the lead we have the white
team's third runner, Lisbeth!
Announcer
406701101_4_a
We're down to the final third
and fourth runners in the relay!
Announcer
406701101_3_a
Leafa
406701101_2_a
bg_event_grounds
WOOOOOO!!!
Audience
406701101_1_a
...
Asuna
406701001_32_a
Without you cheering the other
red team players on, the white
team has a big advantage...
Yui
406701001_31_a
Oh, that's me! I have to go...
Asuna
406701001_30_a
Will all participating players
please assemble in the middle
of the track!
Announcer
406701001_29_a
Now then, folks, we've come to our
final game of the day: the relay!
Announcer
406701001_28_a
I think you're right...
Asuna
406701001_27_a
If we can't figure out what it is,
I think we'll have a tough time
holding on to our lead.
Yui
406701001_26_a
I think they might try to use
their secret weapon in the next
game, too.
Yui
406701001_25_a
The white team is breathing down
our necks...
Asuna
406701001_24_a
Talk about a one in a million
fight! Or should I say, one in
TWO million?!
Announcer
406701001_23_a
Liz and Leafa's incredible
performance in the chicken race
really helped them catch up!
Announcer
406701001_22_a
Then we have the white team, who
speedily ascended to a close
second!
Announcer
406701001_21_a
In first place we have the red
team, cheered on to glory by
Asuna!
Announcer
406701001_20_a
We've had some pretty surprising
upsets so far!
Announcer
406701001_19_a
Now let's take one more look at
the scores!
Announcer
406701001_18_a
...
Asuna
406701001_17_a
I suppose so. Maybe thinking about
it in those terms will give us
some sort of hint...
Yui
406701001_16_a
Meaning that if that secret got
out, the white team would totally
lose its advantage.
Asuna
406701001_15_a
Those two mentioned some secret
tactic they were using, but I have
no idea what it might be...
Yui
406701001_14_a
It didn't?
Asuna
406701001_13_a
But it didn't do anything to slow
Liz or Leafa's group down...
Yui
406701001_12_a
I was wondering that myself, so
I cast debuff spells on all the
white team players.
Yui
406701001_11_a
I wonder if they were using a buff
like we were? The rules say that's
fair game, so...
Asuna
406701001_10_a
Then how were they able to move
so quickly?
Asuna
406701001_9_a
If anything, the three players
carrying them were extremely
average.
Yui
406701001_8_a
No. I looked into it, but they
didn't seem to be that powerful.
Yui
406701001_7_a
Were the stats of the players
carrying each of them that high?
Asuna
406701001_6_a
Those groups were so fast... Like
they were running totally
unencumbered!
Yui
406701001_5_a
Yeah, white really ran away with
it... Mostly thanks to Leafa and
Liz, it seems.
Asuna
406701001_4_a
Thanks, but...we ended up losing
to the white team...
Yui
406701001_3_a
Yui
406701001_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Good job out there, Yui.
Asuna
406701001_1_a
I'm so glad it worked!
Leafa
406700901_57_a
You'll just have to wonder! Come
on, Leafa--our next victims await!
Liz
406700901_56_a
Liz
406700901_55_a
Hehe, as if we'd tell you! We're
not dumb enough to spill the
beans to our enemy!
Leafa
406700901_54_a
Agil
406700901_53_a
Klein
406700901_52_a
Just what sort of trick did you
pull just now?! How were you
so fast?!
Kirito
406700901_51_a
Leafa
406700901_50_a
Liz
406700901_49_a
...were Leafa and Lisbeth of
the white team!
Announcer
406700901_48_a
It turns out the ones who stole
all those headbands in the blink
of an eye...
Announcer
406700901_47_a
Not to mention Kirito was the
strongest contender, and we took
him out, too! Lucky us!
Leafa
406700901_46_a
Leafa
406700901_45_a
Hehe, that worked like a dream!
We got so many points!
Liz
406700901_44_a
Kirito
406700901_43_a
Agil
406700901_42_a
When did you... How...
That speed...!
Klein
406700901_41_a
Liz?! And Leafa?!
Kirito
406700901_40_a
And just like that, ten teams lost
their headbands--including Kirito!
Announcer
406700901_39_a
someone else slipped in for
a surprise attack!
Announcer
406700901_38_a
While an anti-Kirito coalition
tried to take his team down,
Announcer
406700901_37_a
Whoaaaaa! What a development!!
Announcer
406700901_36_
Ah! My headband!!
Kirito
406700901_35_a
Hah! Think again!
???
406700901_34_a
Agil
406700901_33_a
Kirito
406700901_32_a
I got no idea what's going on,
but I think we've been saved!
Klein
406700901_31_a
Someone's snatching headbands from
behind while we're all distracted!
Player C
406700901_30_a
Hey, my headband! Who--?!
Player B
406700901_29_
Gotcha!
???
406700901_28_a
What the--?!
Player A
406700901_27_a
Ha ha!
???
406700901_26_a
Agil
406700901_25_a
Klein
406700901_24_a
If we're going down, we're taking
a ton of them with us!
Kirito
406700901_23_a
But we're not gonna just roll
over, are we?!
Kirito
406700901_22_a
This is ridiculous!
Agil
406700901_21_a
Gaaah! There's nowhere for us
to run!
Klein
406700901_20_a
Get 'eeeem!!!
Player A
406700901_19_a
Uh oh, we're surrounded!
Kirito
406700901_18_a
Yeah, saw that coming...
Agil
406700901_17_a
They're super strong! Let's team
up with the others and take
them down first!
Player B
406700901_16_a
Hey! Those are the guys the
announcer was talking about!
Player A
406700901_15_a
Oh...
Klein
406700901_14_a
Tch, now the other teams are gonna
target us!
Agil
406700901_13_a
What? What's wrong?
Klein
406700901_12_a
Gah, that stupid announcer...
Kirito
406700901_11_
Hehe, hear that, guys?
We're number one!
Klein
406700901_10_a
The player with the most headbands
right now is Kirito, of the blue
team!
Announcer
406700901_9_a
Let's see, only about...half the
teams are still in this battle.
Announcer
406700901_8_a
Well, so far so good.
Kirito
406700901_7_a
You're doing great, Kirito!
Agil
406700901_6_a
Woohoo! One more headband for
the collection!
Klein
406700901_5_a
D-Damnit!
Player
406700901_4_a

Hyaaah!!
Kirito
406700901_1_a
Take THIS!
Yui
406700801_42_a
I'm gonna show Mommy I can
fight, too!
Yui
406700801_41_a
Yuuki
406700801_40_a
Sinon
406700801_39_a
O-Okay!
Silica

Silica
406700801_37_a
Yuuki
406700801_36_a
Figures... Be careful, guys!
Sinon
406700801_35_a
Mommy's job is rooting for us!
She's buffing our whole team with
her special skill!
Yui
406700801_34_a
Silica
406700801_33_a
Sinon
406700801_32_a
Wait... Where's Asuna?
Yuuki
406700801_31_a
I didn't realize you were taking
in the fight too, Yui! Yay!
Yuuki
406700801_30_a
It's Yui!
Silica
406700801_29_a
Huh?!
Sinon
406700801_28_a
I won't let you do that!
???
406700801_27_a
All we have to do is keep running
until there's no one else left.
Sinon
406700801_26_a
It'll also be easy to lose a
persistent foe in the chaos of
this battlefield.
Sinon
406700801_25_a
She's right. We're too fast for
anyone to catch.
Sinon
406700801_24_a
You'll be fine! We can always run
if things start going south.
Yuuki
406700801_23_a
I-I'll try...
Silica
406700801_22_a
Stay strong. You're lighter than
us, which is why we're carrying
you. Now FIGHT!
Sinon
406700801_21_a
sniffle
I...I don't know if me
being up top is the best idea...
Silica
406700801_20_a
I think you're right...
Sinon
406700801_19_a
They're a force to be reckoned
with. Not only are their stats
epic, they're totally in sync.
Yuuki
406700801_18_a
Well, with Kirito riding on top of
Klein and Agil's shoulders,
I can't say I'm surprised.
Yuuki
406700801_17_a
Silica
406700801_16_a
Yuuki
406700801_15_a
Grrr... Blue's doing pretty well
for themselves.
Sinon
406700801_14_a
Klein
406700801_13_a
Agil
406700801_12_a
Yeah!
Kirito
406700801_11_a
Keep it up, man! Let's go after
that group next!
Agil
406700801_10_a
Yes! That's our second headband
from yellow!
Kirito
406700801_9_a
Gaaah!!
Player
406700801_8_a
You're MINE!
Kirito
406700801_7_a
Get it, K-dawg!
Klein
406700801_6_a
RRRAAAAHHH!
Kirito
406700801_5_a

And now, without further ado, let
the battle royale begin!
Announcer
406700801_1_a
Yeaaaaah!
Klein
406700701_35_a
Ha ha, well, then let's win this
thing and leave the red team
eating our dust!
Kirito
406700701_34_a
Heh, alright then.
Agil
406700701_33_a
All I was trying to say is that we
work so well together, I'd be
surprised if we don't rock this!
Klein
406700701_32_a
Heh, yeah, I know.
Klein
406700701_31_a
In VR, anything can happen.
I wouldn't underestimate the
other teams.
Agil
406700701_30_a
Don't get too cocky, Klein. I know
you think we've got this on
lock, but...
Agil
406700701_29_a
Hell yeah! This is our time to
shine! There's no way anyone
can beat US!
Klein
406700701_28_a
It's finally time.
Kirito
406700701_27_a
It's the ultimate test of
teamwork! So get ready for a show!
Announcer
406700701_26_a
They'll also need to work together
and focus their minds on a single
goal: victory!
Announcer
406700701_25_a
Not only will players need speed,
strength, and strategy...
Announcer
406700701_24_a
Agil
406700701_23_a
Klein
406700701_22_a
Kirito
406700701_21_a
Only two more games left, folks!
It's time for what you've all been
waiting for: the chicken fight!
Announcer
406700701_20_a
Leafa
406700701_19_a
White team, gather round!
Time for an emergency strategy
meeting!
Liz
406700701_18_a
We've got our own secret weapon...
It's time we use it!
Leafa
406700701_17_a
You're right. Otherwise the red
team's gonna run away with
this whole competition!
Leafa
406700701_16_a
I know we were waffling over when
to use it, but it's now or never!
Liz
406700701_15_a
The only events left are the
chicken fight and relay race.
Liz
406700701_14_a
Got it. Secret weapon time!
Leafa
406700701_13_a
...to seize victory at the last
moment, but we might have to
use you-know-what.
Liz
406700701_12_a
Yeah... I know we were planning
on holding back for now, and then
pulling out all the stops...
Liz
406700701_11_a
This isn't good.
Leafa
406700701_10_a
Hmmm... Blue is still a strong
first, and yellow is third...
Leaving us in the dust.
Leafa
406700701_9_a
I would be too, if Asuna's Cheer
could help ME come back from
behind to win.
Leafa
406700701_8_a
Asuna's Cheer is something else.
The red team is going crazy
celebrating right now.
Liz
406700701_7_a
How did red jump up to second
place? The last time I looked,
they were dead last!
Leafa
406700701_6_a
Hmmm? Whoa!
Leafa
406700701_5_a
Look at the rankings!
Liz
406700701_4_a
What is it, Liz?
Leafa
406700701_3_a
Leafa
406700701_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Whoa...!
Liz
406700701_1_a
Me too! Now the red team actually
stands a chance at winning!
Asuna
406700601_26_a
I'm so glad it worked!
Yui
406700601_25_a
but who knew THIS would be one
of them? What a happy surprise!
Asuna
406700601_24_a
I knew this skill could only be
used under special circumstances,
Asuna
406700601_23_a
You did it, Mommy! That Cheer
skill's buff was amazing!
Yui
406700601_22_a
Yui
406700601_21_a
I-It worked!
Asuna
406700601_20_a
Cheer skill...? Hang on...
Yuuki
406700601_19_a
It is totally acceptable to use
buffs in this competition, so this
victory stands!
Announcer
406700601_18_a
Apparently, its buff effect
DOUBLED each red team member's
strength!
Announcer
406700601_17_a
It seems red's newfound strength
is all thanks to a player's
uber-rare Cheer skill!
Announcer
406700601_16_a
Hmm? Yes? Ohh, I see... Alright
folks, we have some new info!
Announcer
406700601_15_a
N-No way!
Yuuki
406700601_14_a
Red has vanquished yellow!
Announcer
406700601_13_a
Holy moly, what a turn of events!
Talk about snatching victory
from the jaws of defeat!
Announcer
406700601_12_a
No, no, nooooo!!!
Yuuki
406700601_11_a
A-Ahh! Where did this sudden
surge of strength come from?!
Yuuki
406700601_10_a
Red is starting to pull back! It's
like yellow isn't even resisting!
They're getting dragged forward!
Announcer
406700601_9_a
What's this?!
Announcer
406700601_8_a
Huh?!
Yuuki
406700601_7_a
Go red team, go!
Red Team Bystander
406700601_6_a
Yeah! We're one good tug
away from victory!
Yuuki
406700601_5_a
Come on, red team, hold steady!

Yellow is pulling red closer and
closer to the line!
Announcer
406700601_1_a
Go red team, go!
Asuna
406700501_34_a
Let's see if this works...
Asuna
406700501_33_a
Go red team, go!
Red Team Bystander
406700501_32_a
It'll be the perfect thing to test
out my support skill on.
Asuna
406700501_31_a
Alright. Tug-o-war is a relatively
slow-paced competition.
Asuna
406700501_30_a
It's finally starting, Mommy!
Yui
406700501_29_a
Let's do our part and cheer them
on as best we can!
Announcer
406700501_28_a
Each team has sent their most
powerful players to heave and ho!
Announcer
406700501_27_a
Asuna
406700501_26_a
Yui
406700501_25_a
Now then, time for tug-o-war!
First up, it's red versus yellow!
Announcer
406700501_24_a
Silica
406700501_23_a
I think you're right...
Sinon
406700501_22_a
Something tells me the red team
isn't going to do so well...
Silica
406700501_21_a
Tug-o-war is simple. Whichever
team is strongest, wins.
Silica
406700501_20_a
...
Silica
406700501_19_a
Thanks! See you later!
Yuuki
406700501_18_a
Good luck, Yuuki.
Sinon
406700501_17_a
Oh yeah! I'm up!
Gotta go!
Yuuki
406700501_16_a
Every team will be sending their
strongest players to compete...
Silica
406700501_15_a
So let's see what's next...
Oh! Tug-o-war!
Silica
406700501_14_a
Yeah, you're right! Two hundred
percent effort time!
Yuuki
406700501_13_a
Whether in sports or battle, it's
insulting to your opponent not to
play with everything you've got.
Sinon
406700501_12_a
Still, that's no reason to go
easy on them.
Sinon
406700501_11_a
Yeah...
Silica
406700501_10_a
Yui's doing her best, but her
physical stats aren't that high.
Yuuki
406700501_9_a
They may be our enemies,
but still... I feel bad for them.
Sinon
406700501_8_a
And from what I can tell, Asuna's
their only real ace...
Silica
406700501_7_a
Yeah, it seems so... I had a peek
at the red team's player roster a
little while ago...
Silica
406700501_6_a
Asuna and Yui's team is having
a rough go of things, huh?
Yuuki
406700501_5_a
Blue team is in first, followed by
us in second, then white in
third, and red in fourth.
Yuuki
406700501_4_a
Silica
406700501_3_a
Yuuki
406700501_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Let's see what the scores are...
Sinon
406700501_1_a
Of course!
Yui
406700401_31_a
Yeah! I'm going to give it a shot
during the next match. Will you
see if it does anything?
Asuna
406700401_30_a
I'm sure it would be worth trying
it out and seeing what happens!
Yui
406700401_29_a
In other words, times like this!
I think it's worth a shot, what
about you?
Asuna
406700401_28_a
Exactly! Remember how it was only
supposed to be effective at
competitions?
Asuna
406700401_27_a
You mean that skill you learned at
the dueling tournament? The one
that buffs people by cheering?
Yui
406700401_26_a
Remember the special skill I got
from that event a while back?
Asuna
406700401_25_a
I thought of it while watching the
audience cheer you on.
Asuna
406700401_24_a
You do?
Yui
406700401_23_a
I have an idea, Yui.
Asuna
406700401_22_a
O-Of course it wasn't!
But forget about that...
Asuna
406700401_21_a
Maybe, but I feel like that was
more out of pity than anything...
Yui
406700401_20_a
And everyone went crazy for you
when you finished!
Asuna
406700401_19_a
There's nothing to be sorry for!
You did your best, Yui.
Asuna
406700401_18_a
Asuna
406700401_17_a
Mommy, I'm so sorry...
I came in dead last...
Yui
406700401_16_a
Yui!!
I believe in yooouuu!
Asuna
406700401_15_a
Enough staying silent and watching
from the sidelines!
Asuna
406700401_14_a
What am I doing? I'm her mom!
I ought to be cheering her on
right now!
Asuna
406700401_13_a
Ah...!
Asuna
406700401_12_a
Hahaha! Come on, Yui!
Audience
406700401_11_a
Oh! It seems the judges have taken
pity on her and are getting
a platform for her to stand on!
Announcer
406700401_10_a
Yui
406700401_9_a
Come on, Yui! You can do this!
Announcer
406700401_8_a
Oh no...
Asuna
406700401_7_a
Ahaha, look at her cute little
bunny hops!
Audience
406700401_6_a
Yui
406700401_5_a
Goodness me, folks! Poor Yui can't
seem to reach the bread! They've
strung it up too high!
Announcer
406700401_4_a
Ahahahaha!
Audience
406700401_3_a
Yui
406700401_2_a
bg_event_grounds
There we go! Yui has finally
reached the bread... But wait!
Announcer
406700401_1_a
Come on, Yui...
Asuna
406700301_33_a
Ahaha, she's so adorable!
But the poor thing doesn't stand
a chance...
Audience
406700301_32_a
Hang in there, Yui!
Announcer
406700301_31_a
She's running like the wind, but
even so, the other contestants
are inching ahead!
Announcer
406700301_30_a
That's Yui, from the red team!
Announcer
406700301_29_a
Hmm? You're right! There is
definitely a tiny little avatar
among the contestants!
Announcer
406700301_28_a
Yui
406700301_27_a
Hey, hold on! Over there!
Is that a little kid?
Audience
406700301_26_a
Come on, Yui...
Asuna
406700301_25_a
Aaand they're off! Who will reach
the bread first?!
Announcer
406700301_24_a
On your mark, get set... Go!
Judge
406700301_23_a
The other half is eating it!
I can do this...!
Yui
406700301_22_a
Alright... It's like Mommy said.
Running to the bread is only
half the battle!
Yui
406700301_21_a
O-Okay!
Yui
406700301_20_a
Participants, take your places!
Judge
406700301_19_a
Asuna
406700301_18_a
R-Right! Thanks, Mommy!
Yui
406700301_17_a
So even if you aren't as fast as
the others, you can still win!
Asuna
406700301_16_a
Good luck, Yui! Remember, this
contest is all about how fast
you can eat the bread.
Asuna
406700301_15_a
Oh, that's me! I should get going.
Yui
406700301_14_a
Now on to the eating contest! All
participants, please assemble
in the middle of the track!
Announcer
406700301_13_a
Hmm, what's this...?
Asuna
406700301_12_a
I know...
Yui
406700301_11_a
...but you're just a child.
Asuna
406700301_10_a
Well, that's to be expected.
Player avatars are all based on
grown-up bodies...
Asuna
406700301_9_a
I can participate in events like
this. However, my physical
abilities were set relatively low.
Yui
406700301_8_a
Besides, I'm the one who should
be worried... Ever since I gained
the ability to fight,
Yui
406700301_7_a
Yeah, you're right.
Asuna
406700301_6_a
Besides, the sports meet just
started! There are plenty more
games to win!
Yui
406700301_5_a
Yeah, I had rotten luck having to
race against Kirito and Yuuki.
Asuna
406700301_4_a
Don't apologize! Third place is
amazing considering who you
were up against!
Yui
406700301_3_a
Yui... Sorry, I came in third...
Asuna
406700301_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Good job, Mommy!
Yui
406700301_1_a
Ugh, your optimism here is not
helping...
Asuna
406700201_23_a
Yeah! Let's all just try our best!
Yuuki
406700201_22_a
Haha, don't give up before the
race has even started, Asuna!
Kirito
406700201_21_a
Between your ability to game the
system and Yuuki's natural talent,
I don't see how I stand a chance.
Asuna
406700201_20_a
Applying theories like that to
gameplay is kind of your thing,
huh, Kirito?
Asuna
406700201_19_a
Geez, Kirito, talk about
overthinking things!
I'm just gonna run!
Yuuki
406700201_18_a
And if I focus and don't slip up,
I know I can win.
Kirito
406700201_17_a
Stamina's not a problem for a
sprint, so it all comes down to
basic movements and efficiency.
Kirito
406700201_16_a
...and maintaining the rhythm of
your body's movements at top
speed.
Kirito
406700201_15_a
See, there are two things you have
to nail in a VR sprint:
the timing of the start signal...
Kirito
406700201_14_a
Yeah... But watch yourself, Yuuki!
I'm gonna give you a run for
your money!
Kirito
406700201_13_a
If we were flying instead of
running, Leafa would leave all
of us in the dust.
Asuna
406700201_12_a
Hehe, well I'm not worried!
I know how crazy fast I am!
Yuuki
406700201_11_a
But I don't think I can hold a
candle to either of you in ALO.
Asuna
406700201_10_a
Well, that may have been true
back in SAO... My build was all
speed back then.
Asuna
406700201_9_a
The feeling's mutual. Your speed
is off the charts, right?
Kirito
406700201_8_a
What rotten luck to have to run
a sprint against both of you...
Asuna
406700201_7_a
Hehe, I'm here too, you know!
Yuuki
406700201_6_a
Asuna? I can't believe we're up
against each other on the
very first match.
Kirito
406700201_5_a
No way...
Asuna
406700201_4_a
First up is the 100-Meter Dash!
This race will determine the
world's fastest fairy!
Announcer
406700201_3_a
Asuna
406700201_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Then without further ado...
Let the games begin!
Announcer
406700201_1_a
I mean, obviously!
Liz
406700101_50_a
We gotta do our best to help the
white team win, Liz!
Leafa
406700101_49_a
Liz
406700101_48_a
Hehe, it's the perfect chance to
see what everyone's REALLY
made of!
Leafa
406700101_47_a
Silica
406700101_46_a
Sinon
406700101_45_a
Yeah. Asuna and Yui are on red,
and Kirito and the boys are
on blue.
Yuuki
406700101_44_a
Looks like we all got split up...
Silica
406700101_43_a
Yuuki
406700101_42_a
Silica
406700101_41_a
Yeah, I'm looking forward to
facing off against you.
Sinon
406700101_40_a
Leafa
406700101_39_a
The two of us are on the white
team. Guess that means we
gotta fight you eventually!
Liz
406700101_38_a
Silica
406700101_37_a
Sinon
406700101_36_a
Yep!
Yuuki
406700101_35_a
Liz
406700101_34_a
Hiya! Sinon, Silica, Yuuki--are
all three of you on the yellow
team?
Leafa
406700101_33_a
Yuuki
406700101_32_a
Silica
406700101_31_a
Hey, it's Leafa and Liz.
Sinon
406700101_30_a
Victory belongs to the white team!
???
406700101_29_a
So there's sprints, the long
distance race, tug-o-war, and lots
of other games! I can't wait!
Yuuki
406700101_28_a
Yeah, we can't fly at all in this
stadium, and the events are just
like those you'd see in real life.
Silica
406700101_27_a
I'm a bit disappointed, myself.
I expected something unique,
but it's actually quite realistic.
Sinon
406700101_26_a
You said it! This is my very first
sports meet, so I'm super
pumped!
Yuuki
406700101_25_a
Hey. Let's kick some butt today.
Sinon
406700101_24_a
Over here, Sinon! This is the
yellow team's spot!
Silica
406700101_23_a
Yuuki
406700101_22_a
Silica
406700101_21_a
Oh, Silica, Yuuki! I finally
found you.
Sinon
406700101_20_a
Yui
406700101_19_a
Asuna
406700101_18_a
You too!
Kirito
406700101_17_a
Good luck, Daddy!
Yui
406700101_16_a
Bye!
Asuna
406700101_15_a
Ha ha, seriously. See you two at
lunch, then. I'm off to the blue
team's camp.
Kirito
406700101_14_a
Hehe, not with those two on
your team.
Asuna
406700101_13_a
I'm on the blue team with Klein
and Agil. Well, at least I won't
get bored.
Kirito
406700101_12_a
That's right! NPCs are allowed to
participate today, too. Mommy
and I will give it our all!
Yui
406700101_11_a
I know, but you and Yui are on
the same team, right? Red?
Kirito
406700101_10_a
Yeah. It's too bad you and I
ended up on different teams.
Asuna
406700101_9_a
Sounds like things are getting
started.
Kirito
406700101_8_a
So leave your grudges and hard
feelings at the door, and focus
on friendly competition!
Announcer
406700101_7_a
Today's the day to put race aside
and come together to partake
in some good ol' exercise!
Announcer
406700101_6_a
Just perfect for Alfheim Online's
Autumn Fest and Sports Meet!

Ahh, another beautiful autumn day!
Announcer
406700101_1_a
Hehe, looks like you've learned
your lesson.
Asuna
406501201_59_a
But If it's gonna get me ganged up
on like this, I never wanna be
a dread lord again...
Kirito
406501201_58_a
Asuna
406501201_57_a
Yui
406501201_56_a
Sorry... the ability to
roleplay like that is one of the
best things about VRMMOS...
Kirito
406501201_55_a
Alice
406501201_54_a
We weren't fighting for the Divine
Objects this time, so it's okay,
but please don't do that again.
Eugeo
406501201_53_a
Asuna
406501201_52_a
Yui
406501201_51_a
sigh
Yeah, I guess it was...
Kirito
406501201_50_a
Yuuki
406501201_49_a
Hehe, I could tell you were having
a lot of fun playing the bad guy,
but that was a big mistake.
Silica
406501201_48_a
Silica
406501201_47_a
The players really wanted justice
served after hearing Kirito say
those evil things.
Yuuki
406501201_46_a
Asuna
406501201_45_a
Yui
406501201_44_a
Not cool, guys!
Kirito
406501201_43_a
Sinon
406501201_42_a
Totally!
Leafa
406501201_41_a
Leafa
406501201_40_a
Hehe, of course it is. We had the
exact same conversation.
Sinon
406501201_39_a
Alice
406501201_38_a
Ha ha, we were just talking about
how it's all Kirito's fault that
we were defeated.
Eugeo
406501201_37_a
Eugeo
406501201_36_a
Y-Yes, quite right...
Alice
406501201_35_a
Yuuki
406501201_34_a
A-Alice, please put your sword
away! We aren't at war anymore!
Silica
406501201_33_a
Eugeo
406501201_32_a
Grrr... The gall of you!
Alice
406501201_31_a
Silica
406501201_30_a
Taking the garden was what really
clinched it for us!
Yuuki
406501201_29_a
Sinon
406501201_28_a
Hehe, looks like we won!
Leafa
406501201_27_a
Yui
406501201_26_a
Kirito
406501201_25_a
Sinonon and the others are here!
Asuna
406501201_24_a
Leafa
406501201_23_a
There you are.
Sinon
406501201_22_a
Asuna
406501201_21_a
Yui
406501201_20_a
Hahaha, I'm sorry...
Kirito
406501201_19_a
Eugeo
406501201_18_a
All it did was pour oil on the
fire.
Alice
406501201_17_a
Eugeo
406501201_16_a
We were defeated... Kirito should
not have so readily taken up the
mantle of villainy.
Alice
406501201_15_a
Asuna
406501201_14_a
Yui
406501201_13_a
That means we lost.
Kirito
406501201_12_a
Alice
406501201_11_a
Um, so...
Eugeo
406501201_10_a
Asuna
406501201_9_a
Yui
406501201_8_a
Yeah...
Kirito
406501201_7_a
Unfortunately the attackers beat
us back at the end...
Asuna
406501201_6_a
It appears rewards have been sent,
based on each player's final
results.
Yui
406501201_5_a
It says the PvP battles are over.
Meaning the battle for the Dread
Bastion is finished.
Yui

Asuna

bg_event_devil_castle_02
This message...
Kirito
406501201_1_a
Yeah!
Leafa
406501101_30_a
Let's keep fighting until this
Dread Bastion falls!
Sinon
406501101_29_a
Leafa
406501101_28_a
This is a major bridgehead... Now
that we have it, this battle is all
but won!
Sinon
406501101_27_a
Silica
406501101_26_a
Definitely not. But I won't let
anyone get past me!
Yuuki
406501101_25_a
Yuuki
406501101_24_a
I can't imagine the demons are
going to let us keep this field
without a fight.
Silica
406501101_23_a
Leafa
406501101_22_a
Let's get to work fortifying this
position as our base! Bring
the others!
Sinon
406501101_21_a
We'll be able to cure all our
poisoned allies with this many
pumpkins!

This is it!
Sinon
406501101_18_a
Kirito
406501101_17_a
Yui
406501101_16_a
Honestly, Kirito...
Asuna
406501101_15_a
Yui
406501101_14_a
Asuna
406501101_13_a
Ha ha... I was just trying to play
the best villain I could.
Kirito
406501101_12_a
Eugeo
406501101_11_a
You reap what you sow. Of course
your enemies will fight back after
such foolish taunting.
Alice
406501101_10_a
Alice
406501101_9_a
Understandable, considering all
the enemies you just had to
deal with.
Eugeo
406501101_8_a
Yui
406501101_7_a
Asuna
406501101_6_a
Th-They got me... I don't think
I'll be getting back to the battle
any time soon...
Kirito
406501101_5_a
Daddy! Are you okay?!
Yui
406501101_4_a
Asuna
406501101_3_a
Yui
406501101_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_02
Gaaah...
Kirito
406501101_1_a
Kirito, I'm sorry, but we're
taking you out!
Silica
406501001_56_a
Silica
406501001_55_a
Down with the Dread Lord Kirito!
Yuuki
406501001_54_a
Sinon
406501001_53_a
You got it!
Leafa
406501001_52_a
Did you hear that, everyone? We
can't let him get away with this!
We have to destroy him!
Sinon
406501001_51_a
Leafa
406501001_50_a
You fiend!
Sinon
406501001_49_a
Asuna
406501001_48_a
Let none so much as glance at a
pumpkin! Our enemies shall die
in agony! Mwahahaha!
Kirito
406501001_47_a
Who knew you had such a flare
for the dramatic...
Asuna
406501001_46_a
Kirito
406501001_45_a
Um, you're really getting into
this whole "dread lord" role,
aren't you?
Asuna
406501001_44_a
Alice
406501001_43_a
What is it, Kirito?
Eugeo
406501001_42_a
Asuna
406501001_41_a
We four are the lords of
the Dread Bastion!
Kirito
406501001_40_a
Asuna
406501001_39_a
Normally I'd have no issue sharing
the pumpkins with everyone
but
not this time.
Kirito
406501001_38_a
Eugeo
406501001_37_a
Kirito?
Alice
406501001_36_a
Kirito
406501001_35_a
Why are you laughing?
Asuna
406501001_34_a
Asuna
406501001_33_a
Hehe... Hahahaha!
Kirito
406501001_32_a
Leafa
406501001_31_a
Sinon
406501001_30_a
HYAAAH!
Attackers
406501001_29_a
Leafa
406501001_28_a
Come on, everybody!
Sinon
406501001_27_a
Silica
406501001_26_a
So we came to take it!
Yuuki
406501001_25_a
Sinon
406501001_24_a
Well, this battle was always going
to be won by whoever controlled
the cure for that poison.
Leafa
406501001_23_a
Asuna
406501001_22_a
You knew about the gardens too...
Kirito
406501001_21_a
Yuuki
406501001_20_a
Which is why we decided to go
for a full-frontal assault!
Silica
406501001_19_a
Leafa
406501001_18_a
So all we have to do is take
control of those gardens, and
victory is all but assured.
Sinon
406501001_17_a
Leafa
406501001_16_a
I heard that there were pumpkins
growing inside the castle.
Sinon
406501001_15_a
Kirito
406501001_14_a
Sinonon!
Asuna
406501001_13_a
Leafa
406501001_12_a
I bet you can!
Sinon
406501001_11_a
I bet I can guess!
Kirito
406501001_9_a
Asuna
406501001_10_a
Eugeo
406501001_8_a
They are acting more aggressive
than before... Why?
Alice
406501001_7_a
What's got them so worked up?
Eugeo
406501001_6_a
Yeaaaaaah!
Player
406501001_5_a
We have to do whatever it takes
to make it to the garden and
get those pumpkins!
Player
406501001_4_a
Alice
406501001_3_a
Eugeo
406501001_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_02
Attaaaaack!
Player
406501001_1_a
Asuna
406500901_51_a
Right. We can use the poison
without worrying about it
backfiring on us now.
Kirito
406500901_50_a
Alice
406500901_49_a
We have the advantage with the
pumpkin field under our control.
Eugeo
406500901_48_a
Asuna
406500901_47_a
Alright, now that Asuna's healed
up, we can get back to the battle.
Kirito
406500901_46_a
Eugeo
406500901_45_a
O-Oh, good...
Alice
406500901_44_a
Kirito
406500901_43_a
It's absolutely delicious!
Asuna
406500901_42_a
Eugeo
406500901_41_a
Does it taste all right?
Alice
406500901_40_a
I tried to replicate what you
taught me before, Asuna.
Alice
406500901_39_a
Eugeo
406500901_38_a
I did.
Alice
406500901_37_a
Kirito
406500901_36_a
By the way, who made this?
It's the same as my recipe...
Asuna
406500901_35_a
Asuna
406500901_34_a
Thank goodness!
Kirito
406500901_33_a
Eugeo
406500901_32_a
That is a relief. Now that we know
how to cure the poison, we have
nothing to worry about.
Alice
406500901_31_a
Kirito
406500901_30_a
Yeah. The poison indicator is gone
from my status screen. I'm all
better.
Asuna
406500901_29_a
Did it work?
Kirito
406500901_28_a
It's so soft and sweet...
The perfect comfort food.
Asuna
406500901_27_a
Kirito
406500901_26_a
bg_04_inn_bed
This stewed pumpkin is really
good...
Asuna
406500901_25_a
Eugeo
406500901_24_a
Of course.
Alice
406500901_23_a
Yui
406500901_22_a
Alice, you're amazing! Can you
show me where they are?
Kirito
406500901_21_a
Eugeo
406500901_20_a
I found them when I was
familiarizing myself with the
castle before the siege.
Alice
406500901_19_a
Yui
406500901_18_a
What?!
Kirito
406500901_17_a
Eugeo
406500901_16_a
If it is pumpkins you want, I have
seen them growing in the castle's
garden.
Alice
406500901_15_a
But what was that about pumpkins?
Eugeo
406500901_14_a
Alice
406500901_13_a
Well enough. We've pushed them
back for the time being.
Eugeo
406500901_12_a
Yui
406500901_11_a
Alice, Eugeo, how did the battle
go at the front gates?
Kirito
406500901_10_a
Eugeo
406500901_9_a
Pumpkins? Did I hear that
correctly?
Alice
406500901_8_a
Kirito
406500901_7_a
Well, they are pretty rare items.
Yui
406500901_6_a
That's definitely fitting for
Halloween, but I don't think
I've ever seen a pumpkin here...
Kirito
406500901_5_a
All the players are talking about
it.
Yui
406500901_4_a
Yes. It seems the pumpkins
that appear in this area can
counteract it.
Yui
406500901_3_a
Yui
406500901_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_02
You found a way to cure the
poison?!
Kirito
406500901_1_a
I'm cured! I don't have Fatal
Poison anymore!
Leafa
406500801_56_a
What's the matter, Leafa?
Silica
406500801_55_a
Yeah... Huh? Wait, what?
Leafa
406500801_54_a
Hehe, I'm glad! Well, I should
probably get back to the battle
now...
Silica
406500801_53_a
slurp
slurp
... Aah, that's
so good! It tastes like a warm
hug... I feel so much better!
Leafa
406500801_52_a
I hope you like it!
Silica
406500801_51_a
Thank you, Silica!
Leafa
406500801_50_a
I thought I'd get it for you since
it's only around for a little
while.
Silica
406500801_49_a
It is! They only serve it during
the Halloween season.
Silica
406500801_48_a
Ooh, that smells amazing! Wait a
second, is this pumpkin soup?!
Leafa
406500801_47_a
So I brought you some food from
the inn.
Silica
406500801_46_a
I won't stay long... I just came
since I thought you must be
getting hungry.
Silica
406500801_45_a
D-Don't come in here, Silica!
You'll get poisoned!
Leafa
406500801_44_a
Leafa
406500801_43_a
Are you okay, Leafa?
Silica
406500801_42_a
...I'm just dying for something
to eat.
Leafa
406500801_41_a
I shut myself up in this room so
I wouldn't spread the poison
to everyone, but...
Leafa
406500801_40_a
bg_04_inn_bed
Maaaan, I'm soooo hungry...
Leafa
406500801_39_a
Yui
406500801_38_a
Maybe it's still too early to know
for certain, but we should look
into it more.
Kirito
406500801_37_a
Yui
406500801_36_a
N-Nothing... Just agreeing that
Alice is right. There must be
some way to counteract it.
Kirito
406500801_35_a
Alice
406500801_34_a
What are you and Yui discussing?
Eugeo
406500801_33_a
Yui
406500801_32_a
The announcement only said no
existing item could cure it,
not that NOTHING could.
Kirito
406500801_31_a
Actually, Yui, I think they might
be onto something.
Kirito
406500801_30_a
...it's because that's how this
poison was set up to function
in the game...
Yui
406500801_29_a
Kirito
406500801_28_a
Daddy, I don't know how we're
going to explain this to them,
but...
Yui
406500801_27_a
Alice
406500801_26_a
True. In nature, poisonous
creatures always have some way
of counteracting their toxins.
Eugeo
406500801_25_a
Yui
406500801_24_a
I'm not sure...
Kirito
406500801_23_a
Eugeo
406500801_22_a
What would they do if they were
ever infected by their own poison?
Alice
406500801_21_a
It makes no sense that there
would be no way to cure it.
Alice
406500801_20_a
...it is something the creatures
who live here in the Dread Bastion
are able to use.
Alice
406500801_19_a
Eugeo
406500801_18_a
If this poison were artificial,
I could understand that, but...
Alice
406500801_17_a
Yui
406500801_16_a
What is?
Kirito
406500801_15_a
Eugeo
406500801_14_a
Strange...
Alice
406500801_13_a
Yui
406500801_12_a
If you see anyone trying to use
it, you watch out.
Kirito
406500801_11_a
This poison doesn't just affect
our enemies, but our allies too.
Kirito
406500801_9_a
Yui
406500801_10_a
Alice
406500801_8_a
Alright.
Eugeo
406500801_7_a
Yui
406500801_6_a
She's resting, but the two of you
should probably steer clear of
her for the time being.
Kirito
406500801_5_a
Yui
406500801_4_a
It's temporary, so she'll be back
on her feet in no time, but it is
really infectious.
Kirito
406500801_3_a
Alice
406500801_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_02
Asuna is poisoned?
Eugeo
406500801_1_a
Okay!
Yuuki
406500701_31_a
Got it... Yuuki, go let the other
players know.
Sinon
406500701_30_a
Leafa's resting at a nearby inn
right now, but we should all still
be really careful.
Silica
406500701_29_a
Friend or foe, huh? I bet they
came up with this to shake up
the battle even more.
Sinon
406500701_28_a
Players aren't the only ones who
can catch it, either. Enemy mobs
can too.
Yuuki
406500701_27_a
This "Fatal Poison" can't be cured
by items and is crazy infectious.
Yuuki
406500701_26_a
I looked up that ailment. Everyone
is talking about it right now.
Yuuki
406500701_25_a
Yes, the vampire got her with a
poison breath attack...
Silica
406500701_24_a
Yuuki
406500701_23_a
Silica
406500701_22_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Leafa's been poisoned?
Sinon
406500701_21_a
Kirito
406500701_20_a
Asuna
406500701_19_a
Okay, Daddy...
Yui
406500701_18_a
Alright... Come on, Yui.
Let's go.
Kirito
406500701_17_a
I'll be fine if I just wait! We
have to do whatever it takes
so we don't lose anyone else!
Asuna
406500701_16_a
Fat chance! I'm not just gonna
abandon you!
Kirito
406500701_15_a
Kirito, Yui, get away from me!
Hurry!
Asuna
406500701_14_a
What?!
Kirito
406500701_13_a
...is that it's highly infectious
and will start spreading to other
players and mobs.
Yui
406500701_12_a
Well, there's more... The biggest
problem with this poison...
Yui
406500701_11_a
Well, I suppose that just means
I'll have to wait it out...
Asuna
406500701_10_a
Its effects are temporary, but it
is impossible to use any existing
items to cure it.
Yui
406500701_9_a
You can get one-use knives in the
castle that have it. It's also
one of the demons' special skills.
Yui
406500701_8_a
Fitting.
Kirito
406500701_7_a
It seems "Fatal Poison" is a
limited-time ailment only
available for Halloween.
Yui
406500701_6_a
Mommy, Daddy, I did a little
research.
Yui
406500701_5_a
Dammit, why isn't Asuna's debuff
going away?!
Kirito
406500701_4_a
Yui
406500701_3_a
Kirito
406500701_2_a
bg_04_inn_bed
Hnngh...
Asuna
406500701_1_a
Th-Thanks...
Asuna
406500601_44_a
We gotta cure it. I've got plenty
of antidotes if you need one.
Kirito
406500601_43_a
I knew it, that knife was laced
with something.
Kirito
406500601_42_a
Have you ever heard of
"Fatal Poison"?
Asuna
406500601_41_a
Okay... Huh? I've never seen this
kind of status ailment before...
Asuna
406500601_40_a
Check your status. Something's
gotta be up!
Kirito
406500601_39_a
S-Strange... I can't...
I can't seem to stand...
Asuna
406500601_38_a
A-Asuna? Hey! Hang in there!
Kirito
406500601_37_a
Yeah, I-I'm...fine...
I...
Asuna
406500601_36_a
Are you all right, Asuna?!
Kirito
406500601_35_a
Tch... It may have only grazed
you, but that's all it takes.
Player
406500601_34_a
Gaah!
Asuna
406500601_33_a
Watch out, Kirito!
Asuna
406500601_32_a
Throwing knives?!
Kirito
406500601_31_a
Try dodging THIS!
Player
406500601_30_a
What?!
Kirito
406500601_29_a
I'm not done yet...
Player
406500601_28_a
Guess I should've expected this
from Sinon.
Kirito
406500601_27_a
Phew... I can't believe all the
fronts they're fighting us on.
Kirito
406500601_26_a
Gaaaah!
Player
406500601_25_a
Asuna
406500601_24_a
bg_event_devil_castle_02
Take this!
Kirito
406500601_23_a
Leafa
406500601_22_a
Pina
406500601_21_a
Leafa!

406500601_20_a
Aaaahhhhh!
Leafa
406500601_19_a
What?!
Leafa
406500601_18_a
HAAAH!
Vampire
406500601_17_a
Hnnghh... I am not finished vith
you yet!
Vampire
406500601_16_a
Thanks to you, I am, Leafa!
Silica
406500601_15_a
Are you okay, Silica?!
Leafa
406500601_14_a
Aaauughhhh!
Vampire
406500601_13_a
Pina
406500601_12_a
Suck on THIS!
Leafa
406500601_11_a
Aaaaahhh!
Silica
406500601_10_a
I vant to suck your bloood!
Vampire
406500601_9_a
Chirp chiiirp!
Pina
406500601_8_a
I have to harden my heart and
fight!
Silica
406500601_7_a
You're right, Pina. This is war,
after all.
Silica
406500601_6_a
Chiiirp...
Pina
406500601_5_a
Aww, these demons are actually
kinda cute... It almost makes me
sad I have to destroy them.
Silica
406500601_4_a
GRARR!
Demon
406500601_3_a
Pina
406500601_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Take this!
Silica
406500601_1_a
I'm counting on you, Yuuki!
Sinon
406500501_19_a
Right, I should get to my position
too. Catch up with you later,
Sinon!
Yuuki
406500501_18_a
Hehe, you would.
Sinon
406500501_17_a
I'm glad it turned out this way!
I love the challenge!
Yuuki
406500501_16_a
True. I thought it'd be easy since
it was all of us against just the
four of them, but guess not.
Sinon
406500501_15_a
Kinda goes along with the whole
"dread lord" thing. Otherwise this
fight would be too one-sided!
Yuuki
406500501_14_a
Yeah... It's crazy to think
they're the ones commanding
all these terrifying creatures...
Sinon
406500501_13_a
Well, they're the bosses, so we
gotta get though these monsters
first and get into the castle!
Yuuki
406500501_12_a
Except this time they're our
enemies. Heh, I hope we get
to fight them soon.
Sinon
406500501_11_a
I guess most of the time, Kirito
or Asuna take control of the
situation, huh?
Yuuki
406500501_10_a
Even though I'm not really
the leader type...
Sinon
406500501_9_a
It's not on purpose, Yuuki! For
some reason, people always end
up relying on me for orders.
Sinon
406500501_8_a
Hehe, you're getting good at this
whole commanding-an-army
thing, Sinon!
Yuuki
406500501_7_a
Roger that!
Leafa
406500501_6_a
You go help Silica and the others!
Sinon
406500501_5_a
Don't worry. The archers can
handle them.
Sinon
406500501_4_a
Sinon, the werewolves are getting
closer!
Leafa
406500501_3_a
HYAAAH!
Players
406500501_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Attack!
Archers, forward!
Sinon
406500501_1_a
Eugeo
406500401_44_a
...?
Alice
406500401_43_a
Asuna
406500401_42_a
Hehe... Hahahaha!
Kirito
406500401_41_a
Let's put those powers to good
use.
Kirito
406500401_40_a
Now that we're lords of the Dread
Bastion, we're endowed with some
pretty impressive powers.
Kirito
406500401_39_a
Asuna
406500401_38_a
Ha ha, well...
Kirito
406500401_37_a
Eugeo
406500401_36_a
Then what do you suggest?
Alice
406500401_35_a
Asuna
406500401_34_a
Splitting up makes us way more
vulnerable to defeat, so we should
stay together.
Kirito
406500401_33_a
Asuna
406500401_32_a
I don't think so. The four of us
are the lords of the Bastion now.
Kirito
406500401_31_a
Eugeo
406500401_30_a
What is our plan of defense? Shall
we split up as well and each take
a group to counter attack?
Alice
406500401_29_a
Asuna
406500401_28_a
Makes sense they'd attempt a
siege. Pretty cut-and-dry strategy
for taking a castle, really...
Kirito
406500401_27_a
Alice
406500401_26_a
I think they've formed platoons
with other fairies and will be
pressing in on us from all sides.
Eugeo
406500401_25_a
Alice
406500401_24_a
Yes. I saw your friends too.
Eugeo
406500401_23_a
Asuna
406500401_22_a
bg_event_devil_castle_02
You're telling me the enemy is
already at the gates, Eugeo?!
Kirito
406500401_21_a
Leafa
406500401_20_a
Then let's get this party started.
Alright, everyone, take your
positions!
Sinon
406500401_19_a
Silica
406500401_18_a
Looks like they're ready.
Yuuki
406500401_17_a
Leafa
406500401_16_a
Sinon
406500401_15_a
Okay, everyone's here!
Player
406500401_14_a
W-Well, I don't think I'm any more
or less excited than usual...
Sinon
406500401_13_a
You sound SO pumped for this,
Sinon!
Leafa
406500401_12_a
Destroying all those demons should
be a piece of cake with their help.
Sinon
406500401_11_a
Don't worry. We have plenty of
players to help us capture the
castle this time.
Sinon
406500401_9_a
Leafa
406500401_10_a
Yuuki
406500401_8_a
It's a little nerve-racking,
isn't it?
Silica
406500401_7_a
Silica
406500401_6_a
Ooh, I can't wait! It's been ages
since we had a good fight with
Kirito and Asuna!
Yuuki
406500401_5_a
Sinon
406500401_4_a
Hehe, but who'd have thought we'd
come back as the invading force?
Leafa
406500401_3_a
Leafa
406500401_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Here we are again...
The Dread Bastion.
Sinon
406500401_1_a
Uh, yeah! Totally!
Kirito
406500301_52_a
Kirito
406500301_51_a
Thank you both so much! We're so
glad that you want to help us.
Aren't we, Kirito?
Asuna
406500301_50_a
Alice
406500301_49_a
Hear, hear.
Eugeo
406500301_48_a
Eugeo
406500301_47_a
And in any case, I believe it best
to obey the will of the gods
of this world.
Alice
406500301_46_a
Asuna
406500301_45_a
Eugeo... Alice...
Kirito
406500301_44_a
Eugeo
406500301_43_a
Our time would be much better
spent honing our swords with
you in battle.
Alice
406500301_42_a
The mere thought of such tedium
makes me shudder.
Alice
406500301_41_a
We do not know where to go or
what to do if we do not join the
fight with you.
Alice
406500301_40_a
There is much prohibited in this
world that we do not quite
understand.
Alice
406500301_39_a
We can't very well abandon them
when they need us the most!
Eugeo
406500301_38_a
Alice
406500301_37_a
But we have become the leaders
of the dread hordes!
Eugeo
406500301_36_a
Asuna
406500301_35_a
You know all you have to do is
wait a little and you'll go back
to Aincrad, right?
Kirito
406500301_34_a
Kirito
406500301_33_a
What?!
Asuna
406500301_32_a
Eugeo
406500301_31_a
And I will too.
Alice
406500301_30_a
Alice
406500301_29_a
Of course I'm helping!
Eugeo
406500301_28_a
Yui
406500301_27_a
Asuna
406500301_26_a
You're right.
Kirito
406500301_25_a
It won't be easy, but the two of
us are just going to have to
protect this place on our own.
Asuna
406500301_24_a
Talk about being stuck between
a rock and a hard place... Well,
I guess we don't have a choice.
Kirito
406500301_23_a
Well, we could, but then that'd
just leave Asuna and me to
defend the Dread Bastion...
Kirito
406500301_22_a
Can't you just keep those two from
taking part in any quest that's
not related to the Divine Objects?
Yui
406500301_21_a
But I don't want to lie, either.
It feels too duplicitous.
Asuna
406500301_20_a
If she hears that, there's no way
Alice will want any part of it.
Asuna
406500301_19_a
Good question... We can't very
well tell them it doesn't matter
if we succeed or not.
Asuna
406500301_18_a
I was afraid of that... How are we
going to explain this to Alice and
Eugeo?
Kirito
406500301_17_a
I think so. It is the last part of
the Halloween event, so once
the time limit elapses, that's it.
Yui
406500301_16_a
Well, but I guess it is PvP...
Win or lose, we'll be going back
to Aincrad after this, huh?
Kirito
406500301_15_a
Yeah, but we've got Alice and
Eugeo on our side. I'd say this
castle's as good as defended.
Kirito
406500301_14_a
If we aren't careful, they'll take
us down in no time at all.
Asuna
406500301_13_a
Hahaha...
But you know that makes Sinonon
and the others our sworn enemies.
Asuna
406500301_12_a
Plus, being a dread lord of the
Dread Bastion sounds kinda
awesome, don't you think?
Kirito
406500301_11_a
It has been a while. I'm looking
forward to this too. It's not every
day we get to play defense.
Kirito
406500301_10_a
With so few PvP events in ALO
lately, I think everyone's excited
for some competitive action.
Asuna
406500301_9_a
Hahaha, they said we better watch
out, 'cause this castle is as good
as theirs.
Asuna
406500301_8_a
Whoa, someone's super into this.
Kirito
406500301_7_a
Sinonon said they were gonna have
a strategy meeting about it, and
they left.
Asuna
406500301_6_a
Hehe, it seems like they got word
they'd be the ones attacking the
castle.
Asuna
406500301_5_a
I thought you might have...
Hey, where are Sinon and the
others?
Kirito
406500301_4_a
Yui
406500301_3_a
Kirito
406500301_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Yeah, I heard about the upcoming
battle too.
Asuna
406500301_1_a
Eugeo
406500201_51_a
What in the world is going to
happen now...?
Alice
406500201_50_a
Yui
406500201_49_a
I mean, I bet the oracle told her
the same thing, so we should meet
up with her to talk about it.
Kirito
406500201_48_a
Yui
406500201_47_a
Exactly. I bet Asuna got this
info too...
Kirito
406500201_46_a
Alice
406500201_45_a
The gods have commanded us to
defend the Dread Bastion?
Eugeo
406500201_44_a
Yui
406500201_43_a
It's defenders versus invaders...
Wait, so this event actually
encourages PvP?!
Kirito
406500201_42_a
Yui
406500201_41_a
It means we have to protect this
castle from other play
other
fairies who want to attack it.
Kirito
406500201_40_a
Eugeo
406500201_39_a
What?! Explain!
Alice
406500201_38_a
Yui
406500201_37_a
They say they're making the four
of us the lords of the castle.
Kirito
406500201_36_a
Yui
406500201_35_a
Basically, um...they're giving us
power over the Dread Bastion
since we defeated it first.
Kirito
406500201_34_a
Alice
406500201_33_a
What do the gods say?
Eugeo
406500201_32_a
Yui
406500201_31_a
Let's see... Huh?!
Kirito
406500201_30_a
Yui
406500201_29_a
Y-Yeah, that. But I mean, it's
not as impressive as you
make it sound.
Kirito
406500201_28_a
Eugeo
406500201_27_a
Ah, an oracle...
Alice
406500201_26_a
Yui
406500201_25_a
Uh, this is like...like a message
from the gods of this world.
Kirito
406500201_24_a
Eugeo
406500201_23_a
What is going on?
Alice
406500201_22_a
Yui
406500201_21_a
What? Now?
Kirito
406500201_20_a
Daddy, I have some information.
Yui
406500201_18_a
Eugeo
406500201_17_a
Alice
406500201_16_a
We should keep searching. There
has to be a way...
Kirito
406500201_15_a
But I don't think we'll be able
to take back Aincrad just by
destroying them all.
Kirito
406500201_14_a
Yeah.
Kirito
406500201_13_a
You mean that these here are the
original residents of this castle?
Eugeo
406500201_12_a
...and then replaces them with
its own monsters.
Kirito
406500201_11_a
So that must mean a Divine
Object first strengthens existing
monsters...
Kirito
406500201_10_a
You're right. They're much weaker
than when we first came here.
Kirito
406500201_9_a
Hardly. Though these monsters are
far easier to defeat than before
we retrieved the Divine Object.
Alice
406500201_8_a
You don't think so, Alice?
Eugeo
406500201_7_a
Just what is so "funny" about
that, Eugeo?
Alice
406500201_6_a
Ahahaha, that skeleton has
a funny way of moving.
Eugeo
406500201_5_a
Kirito
406500201_4_a
Alice
406500201_3_a
Eugeo
406500201_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Clacka-clacka-clacka!
Skeleton
406500201_1_a
Sinon
406500101_39_a
Leafa
406500101_38_a
Um... I'm not sure I understand.
Silica
406500101_37_a
Asuna
406500101_36_a
Yeah!
Yuuki
406500101_35_a
Leafa
406500101_34_a
Silica
406500101_33_a
Hehe, that's not true. We still
have plenty of time to enjoy
Halloween.
Sinon
406500101_32_a
Hahaha, hate to break it to you,
Silica, but you kinda are...
Leafa
406500101_31_a
Sinon
406500101_30_a
Leafa
406500101_29_a
Sorry to keep you waiting!
I hope I'm not too late!
Silica
406500101_28_a
Yuuki
406500101_27_a
They're trying to find out if
it's actually been changed back
to its original Halloween state.
Asuna
406500101_26_a
Out investigating the Dread
Bastion.
Asuna
406500101_25_a
Mum's the word! So, where are
those two? And Kirito?
Yuuki
406500101_24_a
We still don't have anything other
than our best guesses to go off
of, anyway.
Asuna
406500101_23_a
Yuuki
406500101_22_a
Yeah. I don't think we should say
anything about it to those two.
Asuna
406500101_21_a
Sinon
406500101_20_a
And that would suck.
Leafa
406500101_19_a
Sinon
406500101_18_a
If it makes Alice and Eugeo part
of this world, then they won't be
able to go back to their own...
Leafa
406500101_17_a
Yuuki
406500101_16_a
But in this case, it's not being
helpful.
Asuna
406500101_15_a
No, that function is what
auto-patches any bugs or
corrupt data, after all.
Asuna
406500101_14_a
That's not necessarily a bad thing
in and of itself, right?
Yuuki
406500101_13_a
Yuuki
406500101_12_a
Yes, that's a good way of putting
it. It's trying to change things
to make them fit in ALO.
Asuna
406500101_11_a
So basically it's the Cardinal
System automatically regulating
for these new factors.
Leafa
406500101_9_a
Sinon
406500101_10_a
Yuuki
406500101_8_a
...could be because of Alice and
Eugeo and the Divine Objects
appearing here in ALO.
Asuna
406500101_7_a
Yuuki
406500101_6_a
Kirito thinks that the reward
being a Divine Object and all the
mobs spawning everywhere...
Asuna
406500101_5_a
Leafa
406500101_4_a
...actually turned into something
more.
Sinon
406500101_3_a
Leafa
406500101_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
So you're saying that what you
thought was just a Halloween
event at the Dread Bastion...
Sinon
406500101_1_a
Sounds like a plan!
Asuna
406401201_41_a
Yui
406401201_40_a
Asuna
406401201_39_a
Great! Let's take a quick break,
then find our friends and thank
them for all their help!
Kirito
406401201_38_a
Eugeo
406401201_37_a
sigh
... I'd prefer to focus on
finding the next Divine Object...
but I suppose we have no choice.
Alice
406401201_36_a
Alice
406401201_35_a
Great! I'm happy I get to play
around with these hilarious
monsters some more!
Eugeo
406401201_34_a
Kirito
406401201_33_a
Yui
406401201_32_a
That's good to know.
Well, that means we still have
business in the Dread Bastion!
Asuna
406401201_31_a
I believe that completing it will
restore Aincrad's place in the
sky.
Yui
406401201_30_a
Asuna
406401201_29_a
Hi there again! It appears that
the Dread Bastion's quest isn't
over just yet.
Yui
406401201_28_a
Asuna
406401201_27_a
Ha ha ha, it was, wasn't it.
Kirito
406401201_26_a
Alice
406401201_25_a
Wasn't our original goal here to
find out what happened to Aincrad
and bring it back?
Eugeo
406401201_24_a
Kirito
406401201_23_a
Oh yeah!
I totally forgot about that!
Asuna
406401201_22_a
Alice
406401201_21_a
The Dread Bastion's back, but what
about Aincrad?!
Eugeo
406401201_20_a
Care to explain?
Alice
406401201_19_a
Alice
406401201_18_a
Wait, hold up...
Something's still not right!
Eugeo
406401201_17_a
Asuna
406401201_16_a
That makes four Divine Objects...
Kirito
406401201_15_a
With it gone, the Dread Bastion
is back to the dark and spooky
place we...tolerate?
Asuna
406401201_14_a
At least the Divine Object isn't
messing things up anymore.
Asuna
406401201_13_a
Asuna
406401201_12_a
Guess not. These guys kinda live
here, though, so I'm not surprised.
Kirito
406401201_11_a
However, it appears that claiming
the Divine Object hasn't cleansed
this fortress of its demons.
Alice
406401201_9_a
Eugeo
406401201_10_a
Asuna
406401201_8_a
Ha ha, look at that. Finally,
the Dread Bastion is back to
normal!
Kirito
406401201_7_a
Alice
406401201_6_a
Look, Kirito! The werewolves and
vampires are back! Hurray!
Eugeo
406401201_5_a
Awoooooo!!
Werewolf
406401201_4_a
Alice
406401201_3_a
Eugeo
406401201_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
I vant to suck your blood!
Vampire
406401201_1_a
M09
M09
Finally. It certainly took them
long enough.
Sinon
406401101_32_a
M09
That means they did it!
Yuuki
406401101_31_a
M09
The monsters are...leaving?
Leafa
406401101_30_a
M09
Graaargh...
Monster
406401101_29_a
M09
Good thinking!
Alright, you go... Huh?
Sinon
406401101_28_a
M09
She's been doing the lion's share
of the work. I think we need to
take some of the pressure off her!
Yuuki
406401101_27_a
M09
Hey Sinon, Leafa's the fastest,
so we had her keeping the faster
monsters distracted...
Yuuki
406401101_26_a
M09
There's no flight limit in the
system anymore, but a girl's got
limits!
Leafa
406401101_25_a
M09
B-But I'm seriously exhausted...
Leafa
406401101_24_a
M09
Don't give up, Leafa! I'm sure
they'll be done any minute now!
Sinon
406401101_23_a
M09
Guys...? I think I'm running
out of steam...
Leafa
406401101_22_a
M09
No idea. She said she'd be late
when Asuna contacted us, but
I haven't heard from her since...
Sinon
406401101_21_a
M09
Leafa
406401101_20_a
M09
Sinon
406401101_19_a
M09
bg_event_alo_sky_night
Hey, Sinon? How much longer
until Silica gets here?
Yuuki
406401101_18_a
M09
Eugeo
406401101_17_a
M09
Right!
Alice
406401101_16_a
M09
Asuna
406401101_15_a
M09
Let's get moving! We should be
almost there!
Kirito
406401101_14_a
M09
Asuna
406401101_13_a
M09
Yeah! I owe everyone for keeping
those monsters distracted!
Kirito
406401101_12_a
M09
Alice
406401101_11_a
M09
We'd never have made it this far
if all of them were here!
Eugeo
406401101_10_a
M09
Kirito
406401101_9_a
M09
That's the last of them!
Asuna
406401101_8_a
M09
Eugeo
406401101_7_a
M09
Alice
406401101_6_a
M09
Grrrak!!
Monster
406401101_5_a
M09
Eugeo
406401101_4_a
M09
Haaah!!
Alice
406401101_3_a
M09
Asuna
406401101_2_a
M09
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Rrraaagh!!
Kirito
406401101_1_a
Asuna
406401001_54_a
Yeah!
Kirito
406401001_53_a
Eugeo
406401001_52_a
H-Hmph! I-I was more concerned
with the Divine Objects' safety!
Now come on, we're wasting time!
Alice
406401001_51_a
Asuna
406401001_50_a
And thank you for worrying about
our friends. That means a lot to
me.
Kirito
406401001_49_a
Kirito
406401001_48_a
Thank you.
We won't betray your trust.
Asuna
406401001_47_a
Eugeo
406401001_46_a
Understood. Time is of the
essence, and I won't waste any
more of it doubting you. For now.
Alice
406401001_45_a
...
Alice
406401001_44_a
Alice
406401001_43_a
...Very well. I choose to believe
in you, as I have before.
Eugeo
406401001_42_a
Asuna
406401001_41_a
Think of it as one of our world's
rules. I know how it sounds,
but I need you to trust me here.
Kirito
406401001_40_a
I can guarantee you that our
friends-and the Divine Objects-
are in zero danger.
Kirito
406401001_39_a
Okay, I obviously should have
chosen my words better.
Kirito
406401001_38_a
Kirito
406401001_37_a
Alice, it's not like that...
Asuna
406401001_36_a
Eugeo
406401001_35_a
Worse, you risk the Divine Objects
as well! They will be destroyed
if those monsters catch them!
Alice
406401001_34_a
Asuna
406401001_33_a
Really?!
Kirito
406401001_32_a
Eugeo
406401001_31_a
They could die, Kirito!
Aren't you worried about them?!
Alice
406401001_30_a
They are your friends, not mine,
yet you callously risk their
lives.
Alice
406401001_29_a
Eugeo
406401001_28_a
They're fine? With thousands of
bloodthirsty beasts in hot
pursuit, you say "they're fine"?
Alice
406401001_27_a
Asuna
406401001_26_a
Nah, they're fine. While they're
distracting the baddies, we slip
in and grab the Divine Object.
Kirito
406401001_25_a
Alice
406401001_24_a
Th-They're in serious trouble!
If those monsters catch them,
they'll be torn to pieces!
Eugeo
406401001_23_a
Asuna
406401001_22_a
If you squint reaaally hard,
you can see our friends at the
front of the pack.
Kirito
406401001_21_a
Asuna
406401001_20_a
Yup! It's a flying monster train,
and our friends are the
conductors. Choo-choo.
Kirito
406401001_19_a
Eugeo
406401001_18_a
H-Hold on, those aren't birds...
Alice
406401001_17_a
Alice
406401001_16_a
You did-WHAT is THAT?!
The sky is full of... Are those
thousands of birds?!
Eugeo
406401001_15_a
Kirito
406401001_14_a
We gave each of them a Divine
Object and had them fly around
the castle's outer walls.
Asuna
406401001_13_a
Kirito
406401001_12_a
Yup, that's right! We called in
Leafa, Yuuki, and Sinonon to help
us get rid of the monsters.
Asuna
406401001_11_a
Does this have something to do
with this plan of yours?
Alice
406401001_9_a
Eugeo
406401001_10_a
Eugeo
406401001_8_a
I saw you summon several allies,
but it don't see them.
Alice
406401001_7_a
Asuna
406401001_6_a
It looks like our plan was a
complete success!
Kirito
406401001_5_a
Alice
406401001_4_a
Where did all the monsters go?
Eugeo
406401001_3_a
Eugeo
406401001_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Kirito, Asuna... What did you do?
Alice
406401001_1_a
Wait...
You're not serious... Are you?
Asuna
406400901_58_a
So if the monsters want them that
bad...
Kirito
406400901_57_a
But I bet the system won't let
random mobs break an item
intended for player use.
Kirito
406400901_56_a
The castle monsters are trying to
destroy them, right?
Kirito
406400901_55_a
And how do you propose we do that?
Asuna
406400901_54_a
Hmm... If a Divine Object's the
problem, why don't we make a
Divine Object the solution?
Kirito
406400901_53_a
It will, but it's only really
useful against a single, powerful
monster-not swarms of them...
Asuna
406400901_52_a
What about the Cross Switch
technique you came up with,
Mommy? Will that help?
Yui
406400901_51_a
Yeah, there's just too many of
them. We need a way to keep those
hordes of baddies off our backs...
Kirito
406400901_50_a
Hmm... Even if we called in
everyone we know for backup,
I don't think we could swing it...
Asuna
406400901_49_a
It'll be next to impossible to
reach the Divine Object...
Yui
406400901_48_a
But it's only the four of you,
and the castle is filled with
terrifying monsters...
Yui
406400901_47_a
get it out of the Dread Bastion,
the event should revert to normal
and everyone can have fun again.
Kirito
406400901_46_a
Bingo. But we can fix this.
The Divine Object's the problem,
so if we can just find it and
Kirito
406400901_45_a
You're saying that Cardinal
auto-changed our regularly
scheduled Halloween event?
Asuna
406400901_44_a
Okay, let's put that in normal
person language.
Asuna
406400901_43_a
the Divine Object into the game,
but a tiny tweak to the Halloween
event let it justify the anomaly.
Kirito
406400901_42_a
But it's the only explanation.
The system was probably struggling
to find a way to integrate
Kirito
406400901_41_a
I find it hard to believe a
carefully planned seasonal event
could be corrupted like this...
Yui
406400901_40_a
Asuna
406400901_39_a
Kirito
406400901_38_a
Daddy... Is this even possible?
Yui
406400901_37_a
Eugeo
406400901_36_a
We don't have much time.
I request haste.
Alice
406400901_35_a
Alice
406400901_34_a
Alice and I are counting on you!
Eugeo
406400901_33_a
Asuna
406400901_32_a
We'll come up with a foolproof
plan, I promise you!
Kirito
406400901_31_a
So Alice, I'm saying so now.
Give us some time to think
of something.
Kirito
406400901_30_a
Asuna
406400901_29_a
Eugeo, Alice...
Thank you for believing in us.
Kirito
406400901_28_a
Alice
406400901_27_a
What she's trying to say is that
we trust you, and we'll follow
your lead.
Eugeo
406400901_26_a
Asuna
406400901_25_a
Alice...
Kirito
406400901_24_a
Eugeo
406400901_23_a
I will wait, if I must.
Alice
406400901_22_a
If you need time to formulate
a strategy, say so now.
Alice
406400901_21_a
I am well aware that we must rely
on your knowledge and wisdom to
lead us to victory this day.
Alice
406400901_20_a
I was not proposing we blindly
charge in.
Alice
406400901_19_a
Eugeo
406400901_18_a
...
Alice
406400901_17_a
Kirito
406400901_16_a
It's only the four of us.
We have to be careful,
and we need a plan.
Asuna
406400901_15_a
I mean, all the other pla-fairies
have run away because it was too
scary in there.
Asuna
406400901_14_a
Kirito
406400901_13_a
Alice, it's not going to be that
easy. These monsters... They're
like nothing we've fought before.
Asuna
406400901_12_a
Eugeo
406400901_11_a
We will reach the heart of this
fortress and seize the Divine
Object for our own. That is all.
Alice
406400901_10_a
Eugeo
406400901_9_a
Simple.
Our task here has not changed.
Alice
406400901_8_a
Asuna
406400901_7_a
That's the short of it, yeah.
Kirito
406400901_6_a
Alice
406400901_5_a
Well, the only way to fix it is to
make it to the center of the
castle and get that Divine Object.
Eugeo
406400901_4_a
So this castle's demons are slowly
being replaced by monsters from
within the Divine Object, huh?
Eugeo
406400901_3_a
Alice
406400901_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Interesting...
Eugeo
406400901_1_a
!/9
!/9
It seems so...
Asuna
406400801_25_a
!/9
The Halloween event is definitely
getting absorbed by the Divine
Object quest...
Kirito
406400801_24_a
!/9
Really?!
Kirito
406400801_23_a
!/9
All the casuals have long since
booked it. This isn't something
an average player can handle!
Player C
406400801_22_a
!/9
They're ridiculously strong,
and very, very angry...!
Player C
406400801_21_a
!/9
I-I've got no clue! Suddenly
the place was filled with types of
monsters we've never seen before!
Player C
406400801_20_a
!/9
Hey! What happened in there?!
What's going on?!
Kirito
406400801_19_a
!/9
Heeeeeelp!!
Player C
406400801_18_a
!/9
No, they're not...
Kirito
406400801_17_a
!/9
Kirito, these monsters aren't
Halloween-themed anymore...
Asuna
406400801_16_a
!/9
Asuna
406400801_15_a
!/9
Really?!
Kirito
406400801_14_a
!/9
Eugeo
406400801_13_a
!/9
It appears to be more closely
related to the normal monsters
we've fought in other places.
Alice
406400801_12_a
!/9
It seems far more fearsome than
those somewhat ridiculous demons
we fought here the other day.
Alice
406400801_11_a
!/9
Hey, over there! I've never seen
that type of monster before!
Eugeo
406400801_9_a
!/9
Alice
406400801_10_a
!/9
Kirito
406400801_8_a
!/9
Something's got these players
running scared!
Asuna
406400801_7_a
!/9
What's going on here?!
Kirito
406400801_6_a
!/9
Graaawr!!
Monster
406400801_5_a

S-Save us!!

bg_event_devil_castle_01
Gaaah!!
Player A
406400801_1_a
x66
Thank you, warriors, fairy and
human... The fate of the world
rests in your hands.
Urdr
406400701_53_a
Kirito
406400701_52_a
We can't risk monsters showing up
in Jotunheimr, so we'll hold onto
the ones we have for now.
Asuna
406400701_51_a
Asuna
406400701_50_a
You got it. Thank you, Urdr.
Hold on just a little longer.
We only need four more.
Kirito
406400701_49_a
Alice
406400701_48_a
We have to find all seven Divine
Objects, then seal these evil
beings back inside-for good.
Eugeo
406400701_47_a
I second Alice here. We know what
we have to do now, and we need to
double-time it.
Eugeo
406400701_46_a
Eugeo
406400701_45_a
The danger is negligible. I'm more
concerned that weaker warriors
than we may find them first.
Alice
406400701_44_a
z66
That is correct.
I have put you in great peril...
Urdr
406400701_43_a
Eugeo
406400701_42_a
Which means the more Divine
Objects we find, the greater
danger we're in.
Alice
406400701_41_a
y66
They were summoned to destroy the
Divine Objects, to release the
true power of the darkness inside.
Urdr
406400701_40_a
y66
The beasts you encountered were
servants of the dark beings still
trapped within the Divine Objects.
Urdr
406400701_39_a
Kirito
406400701_38_a
and Liz's magic evil-repelling
amulet did seem to work...
At least a little bit.
Asuna
406400701_37_a
Wait, it isn't? But powerful
monsters did appear around them,
Asuna
406400701_36_a
Asuna
406400701_35_a
So in other words, it's not really
a curse?
Kirito
406400701_34_a
z66
No longer linked, the power of the
seals began to fade, and the evil
within began to break free.
Urdr
406400701_33_a
z66
However, thieves snuck into the
temple and stole them, scattering
them to the four winds.
Urdr
406400701_32_a
y66
Enshrined within the Hill Giants'
ancient temple, their power united
to form an unbreakable seal.
Urdr
406400701_31_a
y66
The seven Divine Objects are holy
vessels, forged to imprison dark
and malevolent forces.
Urdr
406400701_30_a
z66
I apologize for keeping silent.
However, the curse you speak of
was a surprise even to us gods.
Urdr
406400701_29_a
Eugeo
406400701_28_a
Urdr, I beseech you. Tell us: why
did you not reveal the nature of
the Divine Objects' powers to us?
Alice
406400701_27_a
Eugeo
406400701_26_a
I see... Truth be told, I too am
curious to learn why so much was
left unsaid. The curse, for one.
Alice
406400701_25_a
Kirito
406400701_24_a
So Kirito thought we should ask
Urdr here to fill us in.
Asuna
406400701_23_a
Kirito
406400701_22_a
There is still so much we don't
know about the Divine Objects.
Asuna
406400701_21_a
Alice
406400701_20_a
The goddess...
Eugeo
406400701_19_a
x66
Brave warriors, I am happy to see
you here once more.
Urdr
406400701_18_a
Eugeo
406400701_17_a
Huh...?
Alice
406400701_16_a
Asuna
406400701_15_a
Is right over there.
Kirito
406400701_14_a
I need to know more about the
Divine Objects, and the lady who
knows the most about them...
Kirito
406400701_13_a
Kirito...
Asuna
406400701_12_a
I know this isn't exactly fair to
you, but I hope you forgive me.
Kirito
406400701_11_a
It's just... I can't really find
the words...
Kirito
406400701_10_a
Asuna
406400701_9_a
I'm sorry... It's not that I don't
want to tell you.
Kirito
406400701_8_a
Alice
406400701_7_a
I'm sure you have a reason for
this, but I'd very much appreciate
you keeping us in the loop.
Eugeo
406400701_6_a
They were trying to get their
hands on the Divine Object too,
and they were pushing hard.
Eugeo
406400701_5_a
I'm with Alice on this one. We ran
into another group of fairies in
there.
Eugeo
406400701_4_a
Why have we left the Dread Bastion
to return to this place?!
Alice
406400701_3_a
Eugeo
406400701_2_a
bg_event_urtharbrunnr
Kirito! Asuna!
I demand an explanation!
Alice
406400701_1_a
Y.9
Y.9
Maybe. I do know I've got a lot of
questions for her. What these
Divine Objects are, for starters.
Kirito
406400601_34_a
Y.9
You think we'll find Urdr there?
Asuna
406400601_33_a
Y.9
But I think we should go check
that area out, just in case.
Kirito
406400601_32_a
Y.9
Hmmm... Yeah, this might end up
being a big waste of time...
Kirito
406400601_31_a
Y.9
Let's hurry up and find the other
four.
Asuna
406400601_30_a
Y.9
Y-Yeah... Well, there are seven
Divine Objects, and we have three
now...
Asuna
406400601_29_a
Y.9
Well, remember. This is just a
wild guess. Let's not mention it
to them until we have proof.
Kirito
406400601_28_a
Y.9
We can't let that happen!
Asuna
406400601_27_a
Y.9
Yeah, I think so. If the process
goes far enough, they might never
be able to return home...
Kirito
406400601_26_a
Y.9
But... Isn't that dangerous for
them?
Asuna
406400601_25_a
Y.9
Perhaps the system is converting
their data. Turning them native,
so to speak.
Kirito
406400601_24_a
Y.9
The longer Alice and Eugeo are
here, the more entangled they
become with our world.
Kirito
406400601_23_a
Y.9
Changed? What do you mean?
Asuna
406400601_22_a
Y.9
Maybe the rules governing the
Divine Objects have changed
since Alice and Eugeo appeared?
Kirito
406400601_21_a
Y.9
Come to think of it, other players
were able to mess with our quest
in the Leprechaun territory too.
Kirito
406400601_20_a
Y.9
But if one of them is a public
event's reward, that shoots a big
fat hole in our theory, huh?
Asuna
406400601_19_a
Y.9
Yeah. We assumed that only people
partying with Alice and Eugeo-us-
could do Divine Object quests.
Asuna
406400601_18_a
Y.9
So isn't it strange that one is
now the Halloween event's unique
reward?
Kirito
406400601_17_a
Y.9
came here, and Cardinal tried to
cope by creating the Divine
Objects.
Kirito
406400601_16_a
Y.9
Our working theory right now is
that people from Alice's world
stressed the system when they
Kirito
406400601_15_a
Y.9
Hey, that's a good point!
Asuna
406400601_14_a
Y.9
Why is a Divine Object the reward
for the Halloween event in the
first place?
Kirito
406400601_13_a
Y.9
But there's something that bothers
me even more about all of this.
Kirito
406400601_12_a
Y.9
Yeah, that's what we thought,
but I guess it's run out of juice.
I don't think it's working.
Kirito
406400601_11_a
Y.9
I believe it was supposed to
weaken the curse's power.
Yui
406400601_10_a
Y.9
I have a question. Are you using
the amulet Liz gave you?
Yui
406400601_9_a
Y.9
I find it hard to believe it's
strong enough to summon a
whole castle out of thin air...
Asuna
406400601_8_a
Y.9
B-But...the curse usually just
summons hordes of powerful
monsters, right?
Asuna
406400601_7_a
Y.9
It's not one hundred percent
certain, but it is very likely.
Kirito
406400601_6_a
Y.9
The Divine Object's curse created
this whole castle, didn't it?
Asuna
406400601_5_a
Y.9
Hey Kirito... Now that Alice and
Eugeo aren't here, there's
something I want to talk about.
Asuna
406400601_4_a
Y.9
Yui
406400601_3_a
Y.9
Asuna
406400601_2_a

bg_event_devil_castle_01
...
Kirito
406400601_1_a
Uh...sure?
Good luck, and see you around.
Player
406400501_30_a
Understood.
You there. We apologize for taking
up your time. We will withdraw.
Alice
406400501_29_a
Yeah, I think that's wise. I bet
they would handle it better than
us, anyway.
Eugeo
406400501_28_a
Perhaps we should confer with
Kirito and Asuna before we take
any further action.
Alice
406400501_27_a
True... I agree that we should
avoid unnecessary contact
wherever possible.
Alice
406400501_26_a
What he says makes sense.
We're from another world, after
all. It could cause problems.
Eugeo
406400501_25_a
...Yes, you're right. But Kirito
told us we should try to avoid
talking to other fairies...
Eugeo
406400501_24_a
If we do, then perhaps they'll
give up trying to claim it.
Alice
406400501_23_a
You mean-
Eugeo
406400501_22_a
Yes, that is a relief. However...
I feel we should tell them what
we know of the Divine Objects.
Alice
406400501_21_a
Phew, that's a relief. It looks
like this time our information
is trustworthy.
Eugeo
406400501_20_a
I mean, it was an official
announcement. They don't
fake that stuff.
Player
406400501_19_a
The info on the reward?
Well, yeah... I'm pretty sure
it's legit.
Player
406400501_18_a
R-Right... Good thinking...
Eugeo
406400501_17_a
I trust Kirito. Nevertheless, our
enemies could be deceiving him
too. It's worth confirming.
Alice
406400501_16_a
A-Alice? But-
Eugeo
406400501_15_a
This tale of a great reward
awaiting he who cleanses this
castle... It IS true, right?
Alice
406400501_14_a
Divine Object...? You mean the
quest reward? Yeah, for sure.
It looks super rare.
Player
406400501_13_a
You plan on claiming the Divine
Object as your own?
Eugeo
406400501_12_a
We'll have to hurry up before
you beat us to the reward.
Player
406400501_11_a
Looks like you guys are making
pretty good progress yourselves.
Player
406400501_10_a
I remember you from before...
Alice
406400501_9_a
Hey, fancy seeing you two again.
Player
406400501_8_a
Yeah, that's a-huh?
Eugeo
406400501_7_a
Now, let's regroup with Kirito and
Asuna before we challenge the
next set of enemies.
Alice
406400501_6_a
Of course. No evil can withstand
my righteous wrath.
Alice
406400501_5_a
Alice
406400501_4_a
Alice, you finished over there?
Eugeo
406400501_3_a
Grrack!
Demon
406400501_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Hyaaah!
Alice
406400501_1_a
Come on! Let's get a move on!
Kirito
406400401_48_a
If someone beats us to the punch
like back in Leprechaun territory,
it'll be a big pain.
Kirito
406400401_47_a
Asuna
406400401_46_a
Most likely. It looks like we'll
have to pick up the pace.
Kirito
406400401_45_a
Eugeo
406400401_44_a
Do you think they're after the
Divine Object too?
Alice
406400401_43_a
Alice
406400401_42_a
They were fierce warriors,
and strong. We can't let ourselves
grow complacent.
Eugeo
406400401_41_a
Asuna
406400401_40_a
I can't believe another group
managed to make it this far
already.
Kirito
406400401_39_a
Asuna
406400401_38_a
Really?!
Kirito
406400401_37_a
Eugeo
406400401_36_a
We ran into another party.
They were fairies, like you.
Alice
406400401_35_a
Kirito
406400401_34_a
After what? What happened?
Asuna
406400401_33_a
Alice
406400401_32_a
Sorry, Alice. I'll be more serious
from here on out. Especially after
what just happened.
Eugeo
406400401_31_a
Asuna
406400401_30_a
Ha ha... Has he, now...?
Kirito
406400401_29_a
Eugeo
406400401_28_a
Please, can you talk some sense
into him? He's been acting like
this is for the past hour.
Alice
406400401_27_a
This might sound odd, but I'm
having fun! I feel like I see
something new around every corner!
Eugeo
406400401_26_a
Alice
406400401_25_a
Yeah, somehow. But wow...
There's a lot of strange and
surprising monsters in here, huh?
Eugeo
406400401_24_a
Kirito
406400401_23_a
Yup, Kirito and I handled it.
Everything okay over here?
Asuna
406400401_22_a
Eugeo
406400401_21_a
Is the left corridor clear?
Alice
406400401_20_a
Asuna
406400401_19_a
Guess what, Asuna?
I think I've figured out this
castle's dark secret...
Kirito
406400401_18_a
What is it, Kirito?
Asuna
406400401_17_a
Hmm... Hold up!
Kirito
406400401_16_a
Good idea. All the monsters here
are actually pretty tough.
Kirito
406400401_15_a
Y-Yeah... It's not scary, but
that doesn't mean it's not
a threat... I'll be more careful.
Asuna
406400401_14_a
Whoa! It may look cute, but its
attacks are nothing to laugh
about...
Kirito
406400401_13_a
Awaagh?!
Asuna
406400401_12_a
RRRWAAAAAAGHHHHHH!!!
Ghost
406400401_11_a
Hehe, yeah!
Asuna
406400401_10_a
Ha ha, yeah. It's good to know
that Halloween ghosts don't
trigger your phantom phobia!
Kirito
406400401_9_a
But I don't mind this ghost that
much. It's actually kind of cute!
Asuna
406400401_8_a
I just freaked out for a second
when this astral monster spawned,
that's all...
Asuna
406400401_7_a
Y-Yeah... I'm-
gulp
-fine...
Asuna
406400401_6_a
Asuna! Are you okay?!
Kirito
406400401_5_a
Wah!
Asuna
406400401_4_a
Kirito
406400401_3_a

Eugeo

Kirito, that goes for you too!
Stop fooling around and help me
cleanse the castle of these vermin!
Alice

Eugeo!
This is no time for laughter!
Alice
406400301_46_a

Alice
406400301_45_a

Ahahaha, this is great!
Eugeo
406400301_44_a
--9
Asuna
406400301_43_a
--9
It's called a werewolf!
Kirito
406400301_42_a
--9
Alice
406400301_41_a
--9
It's walking around like a human,
but it's all furry and looks like
a doggy!
Eugeo
406400301_40_a
--9
Ahh! Hey, Kirito?!
What's THIS thing?!
Eugeo
406400301_39_a

Eugeo
406400301_38_a

Alice
406400301_37_a

Awoooooo!!
Werewolf
406400301_36_a
--9
Asuna
406400301_35_a
--9
No, we definitely can't!
Kirito
406400301_34_a
--9
And we can't let that Divine
Object slip by!
Asuna
406400301_33_a
--9
But we don't have time to ease
them into this. The event's only
going on for so long...
Asuna
406400301_32_a
--9
But at this rate, I'll need to
keep coming up with ways to
explain all this ridiculousness.
Kirito
406400301_31_a
--9
I think they bought my explanation
earlier...
Kirito
406400301_30_a
--9
But I think Eugeo's starting to
suspect that something's not
quite normal here.
Asuna
406400301_29_a
--9
...I suppose Halloween has been
leaning towards the silly over
the scary lately...

Not unless I kill it first!
Hraaagh!
Eugeo
406400301_24_a

Eugeo

Repulsive. I shall cleanse this
world of its foul taint.

Asuna

Alice, meet vampire. Vampire,
Alice. Its hobbies include sucking
blood and hanging with bats.
Kirito

--9
Eugeo
406400301_19_a
--9
New enemy detected.
This one appears to have
the gift of speech.
Alice
406400301_18_a
--9
I vant to suck your blood!
Vampire
406400301_17_a
--9
I...have no words.
Alice
406400301_16_a
--9
You don't agree? Look at that
face! It's charming, isn't it?
Eugeo
406400301_15_a
--9
What's wrong with you? Just what
part of that thing is "cute"?
Alice
406400301_14_a
--9
Alice
406400301_13_a
--9
It's just not wicked enough.
It's kind of...cute.
Eugeo
406400301_12_a

Kirito
406400301_11_a
--9
But what, Eugeo?
Asuna
406400301_10_a
--9
Alice
406400301_9_a
--9
A demon, huh? It really looks like
something you'd see in the Forces
of Darkness, but...
Eugeo
406400301_8_a
--9
Asuna
406400301_7_a
--9
Classic demon.
They're a dime a dozen.
Kirito
406400301_6_a
--9
Alice
406400301_5_a
--9
Waagh! What is this thing?!
It looks human, but it's purple
and has bat wings!

Graaargh!
Demon
406400301_1_a
Yeah!
Kirito
406400201_58_a
Yeah, that wouldn't end well.
Now hurry up and smooth things
over so we can hit that castle!
Asuna
406400201_57_a
We can't really just say,
"It's just Halloween, guys!
You know, from the real world?"
Kirito
406400201_56_a
Don't worry about it, Yui.
I'll figure out some way to
change the subject.
Kirito
406400201_55_a
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to reveal
meta information and confuse them,
but it just slipped out...
Yui
406400201_54_a
Oh yeah, for sure.
Kirito
406400201_53_a
bg_17_swilvane_town
That reward's definitely a Divine
Object.
Asuna
406400201_52_a
Hey Asuna? Yui?
Can I borrow you for a sec?
Kirito
406400201_51_a
Yui
406400201_50_a
Kirito
406400201_49_a
I...don't think that's very
likely...
Asuna
406400201_48_a
Alice
406400201_47_a
Good point! The Forces of Darkness
wouldn't hesitate to spread lies
to further their own ends...
Eugeo
406400201_46_a
Eugeo
406400201_45_a
I see. Then we should consider the
possibility that this is another
falsehood spread by our foes.
Alice
406400201_44_a
Yui
406400201_43_a
Asuna
406400201_42_a
Er, well... You see...
Yui's...just...good at gathering
information? Aha. Ha ha.
Kirito
406400201_41_a
Eugeo
406400201_40_a
Then let me ask you this: how,
exactly, did your daughter come
by this information?
Alice
406400201_39_a
Kirito
406400201_38_a
Yui
406400201_37_a
That's right.
Asuna
406400201_36_a
Eugeo
406400201_35_a
You mentioned a "quest reward." So
we will receive this Divine Object
if we purge the castle, correct?
Alice
406400201_34_a
Alice
406400201_33_a
Hmm... That does look like the
other ones we've found so far.
Eugeo

Asuna
406400201_31_a
Kirito
406400201_30_a
item_event_sacred_treasure
That's right. Take a look!
Yui
406400201_29_a
S-Seriously?!
Kirito
406400201_28_a
It appears to be another one of
the Divine Objects that you've
been collecting.
Yui
406400201_27_a
Asuna
406400201_26_a
Kirito
406400201_25_a
Umm, sorry to ruin the mood, but
the quest reward's been announced
and I thought I'd share...
Yui
406400201_24_a
Eugeo
406400201_23_a
We have no choice if we
wish to recover our base of
operations.
Alice
406400201_22_a
Eugeo
406400201_21_a
Okay. It's regrettable that
we cannot continue seach of
the Divine Object though.
Alice
406400201_20_a
Yui
406400201_19_a
Asuna
406400201_18_a
Let's take a minute to get ready,
then bust into that bastion!
Kirito
406400201_17_a
Asuna
406400201_16_a
Yui
406400201_15_a
Yeah, it's gone. However, I bet if
we conquer that castle, Aincrad
will return safe and sound.
Kirito
406400201_14_a
Eugeo
406400201_13_a
Your home... It's gone...
Alice
406400201_12_a
Did they use some form of foul
sorcery to destroy Aincrad?!
Eugeo
406400201_11_a
What's going on?! Is this the work
of the Forces of Darkness or
their ilk?!
Eugeo
406400201_9_a
Alice
406400201_10_a
Kirito
406400201_8_a
Yui
406400201_7_a
But Halloween or not, how could
they just go and take away Aincrad
like that? Talk about rude...
Asuna
406400201_6_a
Okay, sure. I'm definitely getting
spooky Halloween vibes from
this place.
Kirito
406400201_5_a
Aincrad was replaced with another
floating castle, nicknamed the
"Dread Bastion."
Yui
406400201_4_a
Asuna
406400201_3_a
Kirito

That, everyone, is the latest
update! It's an all-new
Halloween-themed area!
Yui

Asuna

You can say that again...
But if it's not Aincrad,
what is it?
Kirito
406400101_36_a
e,9
Alice
406400101_35_a
e,9
It's too small, and something
about it's just...spooky.
Eugeo
406400101_34_a
e,9
Agreed. It's still far away,
and it's hard to make out
in this light...
Eugeo
406400101_33_a
e,9
Eugeo
406400101_32_a
e,9
It does appear to be a floating
castle, but it's not the one I am
familiar with.
Alice
406400101_31_a
e,9
Asuna
406400101_30_a
e,9
That's not Aincrad!
Kirito
406400101_29_a
e,9
Wait, what?!
Asuna
406400101_28_a
e,9
Kirito
406400101_27_a
e,9
Yeah, I'm with Eugeo here.
Look, we're almost back to Ainc-
Asuna
406400101_26_a
e,9
Alice
406400101_25_a
e,9
H-Hey, take it easy, Alice.
It's late, so can we go home?
Eugeo
406400101_24_a
e,9
Eugeo
406400101_23_a
e,9
Then I shall find these
blackguards and strike them down.
Evil will not be tolerated.
Alice
406400101_22_a
e,9
Asuna
406400101_21_a
e,9
Some of them are trustworthy,
but some of them spread false info
just for the laughs.
Kirito
406400101_20_a
e,9
Some people here make a living as
information brokers, and they buy
and sell rumors for cash.
Kirito
406400101_19_a
e,9
Asuna
406400101_18_a
e,9
Well, information has value.
Kirito
406400101_17_a
e,9
Eugeo
406400101_16_a
e,9
Spreading of falsehoods is a sin.
Why is sin so rampant in this
world?!
Alice
406400101_15_a
e,9
Kirito
406400101_14_a
e,9
But it wasn't a Divine Object.
It wasn't even rare.
The whole story was a fake.

We came here to find that "crazy
unique item near Arun," right?
Asuna
406400101_12_a

Kirito
406400101_11_a

He's talking about the bogus info
we got.
Asuna

Eugeo

Trolled?

Asuna

D-Don't let it bug you, okay?
It's not like this is the first
time we've been trolled.
Kirito

No. Should I be?

Woooooooo!!
Yuuki
406301201_27_a
You said it! Let's hit the water
and soak those cares away!
Asuna
406301201_26_a
Sounds awesome! Woohoo!
Finally, a relaxing hot bath!
Yuuki
406301201_25_a
So...you guys must be exhausted
from all that hard work! Why not
hit the hot springs?
Player B
406301201_24_a
Hehe, I almost forgot about the
safe zone problem with those apes
running amok.
Asuna
406301201_23_a
Asuna
406301201_22_a
I'm kinda amazed that we made a
town safe from monster attacks,
despite not being in a safe zone!
Yuuki
406301201_21_a
Leafa
406301201_20_a
And as a bonus, we get to help out
some surprisingly reasonable ape
monsters!
Silica
406301201_19_a
Leafa
406301201_18_a
Sinon
406301201_17_a
H-Hey, I barely did anything! I'm
just happy we were able to finish
our hot spring town!
Silica
406301201_16_a
Yuuki
406301201_15_a
It is hard to believe. We really
owe Silica for making it all
possible.
Asuna
406301201_14_a
Leafa
406301201_13_a
Those apes were giant smelly
headaches for so long, and now
they're selling this place.
Sinon
406301201_12_a
Hmph... Unbelievable.
Sinon
406301201_11_a
...just blissfully hanging out
taking a steamy bath!
Player C
406301201_10_a
Hahaha, bingo! People love
watching those normally terrifying
ape monsters...
Player C
406301201_9_a
Silica
406301201_8_a
Sinon
406301201_7_a
The monkey hot spring, right?
Leafa
406301201_6_a
Of course it is! Not only do we
have hot springs, but we have an
irresistible attraction to boot!
Player A
406301201_5_a
Hehe, it certainly seems popular.
Asuna
406301201_4_a
Yuuki
406301201_3_a
Asuna
406301201_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Hey there, heroes! The town's
hoppin' today, as always!
Player A
406301201_1_a
Yuuki
406301101_42_a
Sinon
406301101_41_a
Yeah!
Leafa
406301101_40_a
Let's head back and see what they
say!
Asuna
406301101_39_a
Silica
406301101_38_a
For sure! And I bet the others
will agree to their terms too!
Asuna
406301101_37_a
Sinon
406301101_36_a
Leafa
406301101_35_a
That's it? That's totally doable!
We made like a billion hot
springs, so we can give them one!
Yuuki
406301101_34_a
...they'll happily leave us alone.
Silica
406301101_33_a
They also told me that as long as
we reserve one of our springs
exclusively for them...
Silica
406301101_32_a
Silica
406301101_31_a
Ahaha... So those scary apes just
came for a relaxing bath? I never
would've guessed!
Asuna
406301101_30_a
Yeah, I've seen pictures. Those
snow monkeys are super cute.
Leafa
406301101_29_a
I've heard swarms of tourists
from all over the world come
to see it.
Sinon
406301101_28_a
There's a couple places where
you can go see snow monkeys
hanging out in them.
Sinon
406301101_27_a
Y-Yeah... Japan's kinda famous for
that.
Sinon
406301101_26_a
Yuuki
406301101_25_a
Sinon
406301101_24_a
Huh. I guess you do hear about
monkeys having a thing for hot
springs...
Leafa
406301101_23_a
Seriously?
That's why they attacked?
Asuna
406301101_22_a
They got so excited about having a
nice bath that they gathered all
their friends and came for a dip!
Silica
406301101_21_a
But when they saw that we'd made
a whole bunch of warm, comfy pools
of water...
Silica
406301101_20_a
Originally, they were just curious
as to what we were doing out here,
so they kept an eye on us.
Silica
406301101_19_a
No hard feelings about us invading
their land, either. Law of the
jungle and all that.
Silica
406301101_18_a
Asuna
406301101_17_a
They didn't attack us out of any
particular grudge or anything.
Silica
406301101_16_a
Leafa
406301101_15_a
Yuuki
406301101_14_a
So...what did they say?
Sinon
406301101_13_a
Yes, I did. It went very well.
Silica
406301101_12_a
Silica... Did you have a nice
chat?
Asuna
406301101_11_a
...
Silica
406301101_9_a
Asuna
406301101_10_a
Leafa
406301101_8_a
Sinon
406301101_7_a
Whoa! No way!!
They're just...leaving?!
Yuuki
406301101_6_a
Ook.
Ape
406301101_5_a
(Yes, I promise.)
Silica
406301101_4_a
Asuna
406301101_3_a
Silica
406301101_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Oook oook. Ooo ooo oooook. Ook.
Ape
406301101_1_a
So, uh... Guess we'll just be over
here. Sitting on our hands while
Silica talks to the nice monkeys.
Asuna
406301001_42_a
(I know. You were here before us.
We sincerely apologize for what
we did.)
Silica
406301001_41_a
Asuna
406301001_40_a
Silica
406301001_39_a
Ook. Oooooooook.
Ape
406301001_38_a
If you're going crazy, so am I...
Leafa
406301001_37_a
Yuuki
406301001_36_a
Leafa
406301001_35_a
Uh... Am I going crazy, or is
Silica really speaking to a monkey?
Sinon
406301001_34_a
(Y-Yes, that's right! We don't
want to fight you!)
Silica
406301001_33_a
Oook ooooook. Oook?
Ape
406301001_32_a
(Ah, yes! Thank you!)
Silica
406301001_31_a
Oook? Oook ook.
Oook ooo ook oook...
Ape
406301001_30_a
They...stopped attacking us?
Asuna
406301001_29_a
(Huh...?)
Silica
406301001_28_a
Oook...?
Ape
406301001_27_a
Asuna
406301001_26_a
P-Please! Just listen to me!
(LISTEN TO MEEEEEE!!!)
Silica
406301001_25_a
Leafa
406301001_24_a
OOOK OOOK OOOOOOK!!
Ape
406301001_23_a
Sinon
406301001_22_a
Yuuki
406301001_21_a
O-Okay, if you insist...!
Leafa
406301001_20_a
I get the feeling that if we hit
back, we'll lose any chance we
have to talk to them!
Asuna
406301001_19_a
Silica
406301001_18_a
No, Leafa, don't draw your sword!
Asuna
406301001_17_a
Uhhh... Guys? Can I fight them
now? Kinda freakin' out here!
Leafa
406301001_16_a
OOK OOK!!
Ape
406301001_15_a
Leafa
406301001_14_a
Sinon
406301001_13_a
Uh oh... It looks like they're
ready to fight, and there's WAY
more of them than us!
Yuuki
406301001_12_a
Asuna
406301001_11_a
I d-don't know!
Silica
406301001_10_a
Leafa
406301001_9_a
Yuuki
406301001_8_a
S-Silica? What are they saying?
Sinon
406301001_7_a
OOOK OOOK OOOK OOK!!
Ape
406301001_6_a
Mr. and Mrs. Monkeys!
Please, hear me out!
Silica
406301001_5_a
S-Silica?! They've spotted us!
Asuna
406301001_4_a
Silica
406301001_3_a
Asuna
406301001_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Oook oook!!
Ape
406301001_1_a
Yeah! Let's do it!
Silica
406300901_53_a
Silica
406300901_52_a
This is it! Let's take back our
town!
Asuna
406300901_51_a
Leafa
406300901_50_a
The place is crawling with apes...
They've certainly made themselves
at home in there.
Sinon
406300901_49_a
Leafa
406300901_48_a
Sinon
406300901_47_a
Look, guys! We've almost reached
town!
Yuuki
406300901_46_a
Well, you have my full support!
Asuna
406300901_45_a
Y-Yeah! I think! It was my idea
to begin with...so I'll do my
very best!
Silica
406300901_44_a
That means everything's riding on
you, Silica. You sure you're up
for it?
Asuna
406300901_43_a
Asuna
406300901_42_a
Yeah! Let's do it!
Silica
406300901_41_a
Sooo... Silica's now our official
negotiator! Let's talk to those
apes and figure something out!
Leafa
406300901_40_a
I hear that for players who use their taming skills regularly, taming skill level can affect how much they understand.
Sinon
406300901_39_a
Yuuki
406300901_38_a
Leafa
406300901_37_a
Nope. Never.
Sinon
406300901_36_a
Wow... Sinonon, have you ever
been able to understand monster
talk?
Asuna
406300901_35_a
Apparently, a few Cait Sith
players can do it. No one knows
how or why, though.
Silica
406300901_34_a
Yeah... I've seen people talking
about it on the ALO forums.
It's urban myth status there.
Silica
406300901_33_a
Silica
406300901_32_a
R-Really?!
Asuna
406300901_31_a
Sinon
406300901_30_a
Yuuki
406300901_29_a
Whoa!! Mind...blown!
Leafa
406300901_28_a
Actually... I, uh...can sometimes
kinda sorta understand what
monsters say.
Silica
406300901_27_a
That means that we have the
ability to understand monsters,
and even bond with them.
Silica
406300901_26_a
Asuna
406300901_25_a
Hehehe, okay... As you know,
Cait Siths are ALO's resident
monster taming specialists.
Silica
406300901_24_a
Leafa
406300901_23_a
Sinon
406300901_22_a
Come on, spill!
I can't take the suspense!
Yuuki
406300901_21_a
Asuna
406300901_20_a
Hehe, I should have known Sinon
would figure it out.
Silica
406300901_19_a
Leafa
406300901_18_a
Yuuki
406300901_17_a
Ahhh. So that's it. Interesting.
Sinon
406300901_16_a
What do you mean?
Asuna
406300901_15_a
Umm... I don't really know if it
will work, but I thought that this
might be a job for a Cait Sith...
Silica
406300901_14_a
Hehe, we're not teasing! Anyway,
let us in on your master plan
already! I'm dying to hear it!
Asuna
406300901_13_a
Asuna
406300901_12_a
O-Oh, stop teasing me, you guys!
Silica
406300901_11_a
Kinda, but Silica! You were
totally awesome back there!
Yuuki
406300901_9_a
Leafa
406300901_10_a
Sinon
406300901_8_a
Yuuki
406300901_7_a
Hehe, it was a little out of
character for you.
Leafa
406300901_6_a
Aha. Ha ha... Yeah, I guess I did
get a bit passionate...
Silica
406300901_5_a
You really saved the day. I don't
think I've ever seen you that
forceful, either!
Asuna
406300901_4_a
For what?
Silica
406300901_3_a
Silica
406300901_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Thank you, Silica...
Asuna
406300901_1_a
Yuuki
406300801_50_a
...
Asuna
406300801_49_a
Leafa
406300801_48_a
Thank you so much!
I guarantee you won't regret it!
Silica
406300801_47_a
But there's a time limit, okay?
Take too long, and we're calling
in the brute squad.
Player A
406300801_46_a
sigh
... Okay. We'll let you try
it your way.
Player A
406300801_45_a
Silica
406300801_44_a
Leafa
406300801_43_a
Silica isn't the type to bluff.
She's got a plan, and chances
are it'll work.
Sinon
406300801_42_a
Asuna
406300801_41_a
Please please please?!
With a cherry on top?!
Yuuki
406300801_40_a
Pleaaase? We'd reaaally appreciate
it!
Leafa
406300801_39_a
But I don't think you'll be able
to find a peaceful solution
here...
Player C
406300801_38_a
Hmm... We do owe you for all your
help...
Player C
406300801_37_a
Yeah! Let's do it!
Silica
406300801_36_a
You want us to hold off on calling
in a raid party to kill 'em?
Player B
406300801_35_a
Leafa
406300801_34_a
Sinon
406300801_33_a
Please, leave the apes to us.
Or at least give us a little
time to try to fix things...
Silica
406300801_32_a
Yuuki
406300801_31_a
We do?!
Asuna
406300801_30_a
Leafa
406300801_29_a
Sinon
406300801_28_a
...We have a plan.
Silica
406300801_27_a
That's true, but...
Asuna
406300801_26_a
Riiight... It's a nice sentiment,
but they're mobs. You can't sit
down with them for tea and a chat.
Player A
406300801_25_a
Wouldn't that be a much nicer way
to take back our town, rather
than by staining it in blood?
Asuna
406300801_24_a
Well... I was hoping we could live
together in peace, instead of
killing one another...
Asuna
406300801_23_a
Come on, they're just random NPC
monsters. What do you think
empathizing with them will get us?
Player C
406300801_22_a
Uhh... I guess?
Player B
406300801_21_a
It was us who invaded their home.
Not the other way around.
Asuna
406300801_20_a
I want to reclaim our town as much
as you do, but those monsters...
They were there first.
Asuna
406300801_19_a
Yeah? What's up?
Player A
406300801_18_a
Yuuki
406300801_17_a
Hey, guys?
Can I have a minute?
Asuna
406300801_16_a
Leafa
406300801_15_a
Sinon
406300801_14_a
Yeah... Those apes probably just
wanted to protect their home...
Silica
406300801_13_a
Asuna
406300801_12_a
Yeah, it's no fun...
But still...
Yuuki
406300801_11_a
And they have every right to be.
Our town's been occupied by a
bunch of monsters.
Leafa
406300801_10_a
Silica
406300801_9_a
Leafa
406300801_8_a
Everyone's seriously pissed.
Sinon
406300801_7_a
...
Asuna
406300801_6_a
But you saw how many there were,
right? We'll need a whole army
to take them on...
Player C
406300801_5_a
Agreed! We're not going to let
those dirty monkeys steal our
town!
Player B
406300801_4_a
Yuuki
406300801_3_a
Asuna
406300801_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
We need to form a raid party! Hire
dozens of elite players and scour
them from the face of the earth!
Player A
406300801_1_a
Leafa
406300701_55_a
Oh, you can bet on that!
Asuna
406300701_54_a
But we'll be back, monkeys!
Just you wait!
Yuuki
406300701_53_a
Sinon
406300701_52_a
Y-You're right...
Let's go.
Yuuki
406300701_51_a
Leafa
406300701_50_a
We're not abandoning it. But right
now, we can't hold it. We will be
back...with a plan.
Asuna
406300701_49_a
Sinon
406300701_48_a
Aww, really?! We just finished
building this town! I don't wanna
give up on it!
Yuuki
406300701_47_a
You're right... I hate to say
this, but we need to pull back.
Asuna
406300701_46_a
Asuna
406300701_45_a
Gah, I give up! There's no way we
can take on this many all by
ourselves!
Leafa
406300701_44_a
Yuuki
406300701_43_a
Those howls... Are they summoning
reinforcements?!
Sinon
406300701_42_a
OOK OOK OOK OOK!!
Ape
406300701_41_a
Leafa
406300701_40_a
They must have gathered their
simian hosts and planned to attack
right when we finished the town...
Asuna
406300701_39_a
Monkeys are crazy smart! I bet
they were watching us the whole
time, waiting for the right moment!
Yuuki
406300701_38_a
Yuuki
406300701_37_a
But why attack now?!
Sinon
406300701_36_a
Yeah, I know! We're in trouble!
There's just too many of them!
Leafa
406300701_35_a
I-I'm all right! But...
Asuna
406300701_34_a
Asuna!
Leafa
406300701_33_a
Ungh!
Asuna
406300701_32_a
Asuna
406300701_31_a

Oook oook OOK OOK OOK!!
Ape
406300701_29_a
Yuuki
406300701_28_a
G-Got it!
I'll do my best!
Silica
406300701_27_a
I want you to help everyone else
get out of there, okay?
Asuna

Yuuki
406300701_25_a
Silica
406300701_24_a
Silica! Only a few of the players
here are strong enough to take
those apes on!
Asuna
406300701_23_a
O-Oh yeah, I almost forgot...
Alright, move out, people!
We've got a town to save.
Sinon
406300701_22_a
That means monsters can wander
in and smash the place up!
Leafa
406300701_21_a
No, we're not safe, Sinon!
This town was built by players!
Leafa
406300701_20_a
Leafa
406300701_19_a
You've gotta be kidding. But we're
safe here. It's a town, monsters
can't-
Sinon
406300701_18_a
Yuuki
406300701_17_a
Run for your lives! We're under
attack by an army of crazy apes!
Silica
406300701_16_a
Silica?! What's wrong?!
Asuna
406300701_15_a
Yuuki
406300701_14_a
H-Help! Fire! Flood! Calamity!
Silica
406300701_13_a
Yuuki
406300701_12_a
Hmm... You know, I haven't seen
them around much lately...
Asuna
406300701_11_a
Now the only problem left to deal
with are those apes...
Leafa
406300701_10_a
Leafa
406300701_9_a
Let's hope our newly-built town
gets some foot traffic.
Sinon
406300701_8_a
Totally! I'm so glad we found that
spring! We'd never have finished
without it!
Yuuki
406300701_7_a
Everyone seems so happy...
Asuna
406300701_6_a
Yeah! For a while there it looked
grim, but we pulled through and
pulled it off!
Player C
406300701_5_a
It felt like it took ages, but
also like it was over in a flash.
I'm just glad we did it!
Player B
406300701_4_a
Yuuki
406300701_3_a
Asuna
406300701_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
We did it! Our hot spring resort
town's finished!
Player A
406300701_1_a
You said it!
Asuna
406300601_37_a
Asuna
406300601_36_a
Leafa
406300601_35_a
Now that we've found a good water
source, let's tell everyone! I bet
they'll be ecstatic!
Yuuki
406300601_34_a
Pina does like some tasty water,
and some tasty minerals!
Silica
406300601_33_a
Hehe, looks like that's a yes!
Silica
406300601_32_a
Chirp, chirp. CHIRP.
Pina
406300601_31_a
Maybe Pina sensed the minerals in
the water, and not the water
itself?
Sinon
406300601_30_a
Pina
406300601_29_a
Silica
406300601_28_a
Minerals... Hmm...
Sinon
406300601_27_a
Yay!
Asuna
406300601_26_a
The magical doohickey did its
magical work! The water's got tons
of minerals! So, hot spring it is!
Yuuki
406300601_25_a
That's right! All you have to do
is artificially heat the water,
and voila! Ooh, look!
Yuuki
406300601_24_a
Even pools of cold water are
considered "hot springs" if the
water has the right stuff in it.
Asuna
406300601_23_a
Leafa
406300601_22_a
Yuuki
406300601_21_a
Not always. There's actually a lot
of places in the real world where
they "make" hot springs.
Asuna
406300601_20_a
Pina
406300601_19_a
Silica
406300601_18_a
Minerals? I thought hot springs
were geothermally heated pools
of hot water?
Sinon
406300601_17_a
I'll do it! I just need to set up
this magical doohickey,
and...activate!
Yuuki
406300601_16_a
Leafa
406300601_15_a
Yuuki
406300601_14_a
No, that's not true. As long as
the water's got the right minerals
in it... Let's take a sample.
Asuna
406300601_13_a
Sinon
406300601_12_a
Pina
406300601_11_a
We can't use cold water for a hot
spring...
Silica
406300601_10_a
Yuuki
406300601_9_a
Asuna
406300601_8_a
Is definitely the opposite of hot.
I think it's just a normal spring.
Leafa
406300601_7_a
Ahaha, I think Pina was just
thirsty. But this water...
Silica
406300601_6_a
Nice going. Figures you'd have
the ability to detect water.
Sinon
406300601_5_a
Did you find something, Pina?!
Silica
406300601_4_a
Sinon
406300601_3_a
Silica
406300601_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Chiiirp!
Pina
406300601_1_a
Asuna
406300501_58_a
Let's go get ourselves in some
hot water!
Yuuki
406300501_57_a
Sinon
406300501_56_a
Silica
406300501_55_a
Yeah! Let's do it!
Leafa
406300501_54_a
Let's try to think of other ways
we can help out. Starting with
finding a hot spring!
Asuna
406300501_53_a
Yuuki
406300501_52_a
But you have a point, Leafa.
We're not doing any good here
right now.
Asuna
406300501_51_a
Sinon
406300501_50_a
Silica
406300501_49_a
Oh yeah...
Leafa
406300501_48_a
Most of the players here building
the town are Imps and Undine,
after all.
Asuna
406300501_47_a
But even if there was, I'm sure
someone would have already tried
it.
Asuna
406300501_46_a
Yuuki
406300501_45_a
Maybe? I've never heard of it.
Asuna
406300501_44_a
Leafa
406300501_43_a
There's magic for that?
Sinon
406300501_42_a
Hmm... No idea! Use Undine magic
to search for water, maybe?
Leafa
406300501_41_a
How do you propose we do that?
Silica
406300501_40_a
Hey, I have an idea! Let's put the
monster hunting on hold and help
find a hot spring!
Leafa
406300501_39_a
Sinon
406300501_38_a
Silica
406300501_37_a
Well, we still can't let the
building teams know we've got an
unsolvable problem over here.
Leafa
406300501_36_a
Yuuki
406300501_35_a
Yeah... It's pretty hard to put
effort in on this when you know
it's pointless...
Asuna
406300501_34_a
Leafa
406300501_33_a
Well, there's not much we can do.
Monsters are going to respawn.
It's just how it is.
Silica
406300501_32_a
Leafa
406300501_31_a
Silica
406300501_30_a
Sounds like we brought up
a sore subject, Yuuki.
Sinon
406300501_29_a
Aww...
Yuuki
406300501_28_a
We're not making much progress,
to be honest.
Player A
406300501_27_a
So, uh... Changing the subject!
How's the search for those hot
spring sources going?
Yuuki
406300501_26_a
S-Sure...
We'll do our best.
Asuna
406300501_25_a
We're counting on you.
Player A
406300501_24_a
Well, just keep at it, alright?
You're the only players on this
project who can handle 'em.
Player A
406300501_23_a
Ah, that's a shame. I guess it'll
be impossible to wipe 'em out
like you could in the real world.
Player A
406300501_22_a
Err...yes? Well... We've taken
out quite a few of them,
but there's still a lot left...
Asuna
406300501_21_a
You handled that pack of vicious
apes, right? Everything's fine?
Player A
406300501_20_a
Err...
Asuna
406300501_19_a
We're on the same page, then!
So, how'd the monster hunting go?
Player A
406300501_18_a
but I'd love a sort of old-Edo
Japanese vibe. Traditional inns,
the works!
Asuna
406300501_17_a
Hehe, for sure. You know, it may
sound weird for the sword and
sorcery ALO setting,
Asuna
406300501_16_a
Asuna
406300501_15_a
Ooh, I can't wait to see them!
Hot spring towns need a whole
lot of atmosphere!
Yuuki
406300501_14_a
Leafa
406300501_13_a
That sounds like so much fun!
Silica
406300501_12_a
...architect skill. They're
designing tons of templates
from the ground up for us.
Player A
406300501_11_a
Nah, that'd be boring, especially
for a tourist destination. We've
hired some players with the…
Player A
406300501_10_a
You're just using basic house
blueprints?
Sinon
406300501_9_a
Yeah. We're buying houses and
getting ready to lay 'em out.
Player A
406300501_8_a
Silica
406300501_7_a
Sinon
406300501_6_a
There's more than enough space
here to build a town now!
Leafa
406300501_5_a
Wow! You've made so much progress!
Asuna
406300501_4_a
Yuuki
406300501_3_a
Asuna
406300501_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
So, what d'ya think?
We're awesome, right?
Player A
406300501_1_a
Yuuki
406300401_56_a
Sounds like a plan.
Asuna
406300401_55_a
Silica
406300401_54_a
Sinon
406300401_53_a
Deal. We'll figure something out.
No need to trouble the others.
Leafa
406300401_52_a
And let's keep this a secret for
now. Deal?
Asuna
406300401_51_a
Okay, then. Let's try to think of
a more permanent solution for
these monsters.
Asuna
406300401_50_a
Yeah. We've got momentum!
We can't pump the brakes!
Yuuki
406300401_49_a
Yuuki
406300401_48_a
Maybe... I don't want to be a
killjoy either, especially now
that everyone's all fired up...
Asuna
406300401_47_a
Asuna, we sympathize with you,
but I don't think peaceful
coexistence is possible here...
Leafa
406300401_46_a
Silica
406300401_45_a
Leafa
406300401_44_a
Okay, I see your point...but no.
That sort of logic doesn't apply
here.
Sinon
406300401_43_a
Now I'm starting to feel bad about
attacking them in their home...
Asuna
406300401_42_a
Yuuki
406300401_41_a
If you think about it from the
apes' perspective, we're the
invaders here...
Asuna
406300401_40_a
Leafa
406300401_39_a
But...then we can't build a hot
spring town here, can we...?
Silica
406300401_38_a
So, wait... That means the
monsters here will keep appearing
for ever and ever?
Silica
406300401_37_a
Silica
406300401_36_a
Leafa
406300401_35_a
Double facepalm. Of course.
We can't just exterminate them
and move on, can we?
Sinon
406300401_34_a
Asuna
406300401_33_a
Facepalm. Monsters just respawn,
don't they?
Yuuki
406300401_32_a
Silica
406300401_31_a
Sinon
406300401_30_a
Huh? What do you-Ooooooh. Duh.
Leafa
406300401_29_a
Yuuki
406300401_28_a
Think about it. Even if we take
out a few monsters, we won't
solve the main problem here...
Asuna
406300401_27_a
Silica
406300401_26_a
Sinon
406300401_25_a
What is, Asuna?
Leafa
406300401_24_a
Yuuki
406300401_23_a
Yeah... But something's bothering
me...
Asuna
406300401_22_a
Leafa
406300401_21_a
I knew these monsters were scary,
but I didn't know they were smart
AND scary.
Silica
406300401_20_a
Leafa
406300401_19_a
Silica
406300401_18_a
Indeed. It's possible it feigned
retreat just to lure us to the
rest of its pack.
Sinon
406300401_17_a
Yuuki, don't chase it!
It could be a trap!
Asuna
406300401_16_a
Hey, it's running!
Yuuki
406300401_15_a
Oook ook OOK!!
Ape
406300401_14_a
Asuna
406300401_13_a
Ha ha, got it!
Now let's get fighting!
Yuuki
406300401_12_a
Leafa
406300401_11_a
Coordinated attacks? They must
be clever and dangerous foes.
No monkeying around today.
Sinon
406300401_10_a
Those monsters work in packs and
coordinate their attacks!
Silica
406300401_9_a
Leafa
406300401_8_a
Sinon
406300401_7_a
You're right...
Everyone, be careful!
Silica
406300401_6_a
I've seen that monster before...
It looks just like a Drunken Ape
from SAO!
Asuna
406300401_5_a
Look! There it is!
Hi monkey!
Yuuki
406300401_4_a
Asuna
406300401_3_a
Yuuki
406300401_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
Ooooook!
Oo oo oook!
Ape
406300401_1_a
Thanks, we appreciate it.
Good luck out there.
Player C
406300301_33_a
Yuuki
406300301_32_a
Right, got it. So we'll head out
to deal with these pesky monsters.
Asuna
406300301_31_a
Sinon
406300301_30_a
Silica
406300301_29_a
Yeah! This place is beautiful!
We can't just give up on it!
Leafa
406300301_28_a
I see what you're thinking. "Let's
not build next to death monsters."
But that'd be a waste, right?!
Player B
406300301_27_a
Yuuki
406300301_26_a
Oh... I didn't know there were
deadly monsters around here...
Asuna
406300301_25_a
Leafa
406300301_24_a
Our workers have already been
attacked several times. So, I
want you to go deal with them.
Player C
406300301_23_a
Thing is, there's a whole lot of
scary monsters in the mountains
'round here.
Player C
406300301_22_a
Umm... We're building a town,
right? Why do our adventurer
credentials matter?
Silica
406300301_21_a
Glad you asked! I've got a special
task in mind for you seasoned
adventurers...
Player B
406300301_20_a
Silica
406300301_19_a
Leafa
406300301_18_a
So, what do you need us to do?
Sinon
406300301_17_a
Hehe, thanks, Yuuki.
Asuna
406300301_16_a
Alright! It's all thanks to your
totally killer idea, Asuna!
Yuuki
406300301_15_a
That's great news!
Asuna
406300301_14_a
Now we just need to pick out teams
to handle each job and get to
working!
Player A
406300301_13_a
tons of people flocked in to help
us. We have more than enough
hands for the job now.
Player A
406300301_12_a
Nah, it'll be a breeze. The minute
we announced we were building a
hot spring resort,
Player A
406300301_11_a
It's gonna be a lot of work!
Yuuki
406300301_10_a
We'll need to clear these trees,
dig all over the place for water,
then put up buildings...
Yuuki
406300301_9_a
Yuuki
406300301_8_a
Hehe, I'm glad you like it, guys.
Now all we need is a hot spring...
Asuna
406300301_7_a
Leafa
406300301_6_a
Yeah, the air's so fresh! I just
know lots of people will visit
if we can find a hot spring!
Silica
406300301_5_a
Ahhh, look at all this virtual
nature! It feels great!
Leafa
406300301_4_a
Silica
406300301_3_a
Leafa
406300301_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
So this is where we're building our town.
Sinon
406300301_1_a
Hmm, your plan does have merit...
Player A
406300201_58_a
I love this idea! Come on,
let's start digging!
Yuuki
406300201_57_a
If we can dig one up, I bet our
town will get tons of tourists!
Asuna
406300201_56_a
That's right. I remembered that
story too, which is why I thought
the hot spring idea might work.
Asuna
406300201_55_a
And I heard that someone found a
hot spring source somewhere along
it once.
Player C
406300201_54_a
Wait a sec... An underground river
that feeds the Undine lands flows
through those mountains.
Player C
406300201_53_a
Uhh, keep dreaming. I doubt the
devs went and programmed in a
hot spring.
Player B
406300201_52_a
Eh, what was that? Did you say
"hot spring resort"?
Player A
406300201_51_a
I know I'm jumping aboard the
self-interest train here, but...
How about a hot spring resort?
Asuna
406300201_50_a
What's it, Asuna?
Yuuki
406300201_49_a
Yuuki
406300201_48_a
Things you want...? Oh, that's it!
Asuna
406300201_47_a
Leafa
406300201_46_a
N-No, I'm not! I think my idea's
a really good one! D-Don't you...?
Silica
406300201_45_a
Aha. Haha...
Leafa
406300201_44_a
Hold it right there, you two.
You're just suggesting things
YOU want, aren't you?
Sinon
406300201_43_a
No, no! A huuuge mountain stage
where people can hold concerts
and festivals!
Silica
406300201_42_a
Sinon
406300201_41_a
Silica
406300201_40_a
Wait, I've got it! How about some
awesome local gourmet specialty!
Leafa
406300201_39_a
Yuuki
406300201_38_a
So in other words, we need to
make a weird-looking building?
Asuna
406300201_37_a
Silica
406300201_36_a
Leafa
406300201_35_a
Like Tokyo's Skytree, Osaka's
Tsutenkaku, or Nagoya's castle,
right? Yeah, that could work.
Sinon
406300201_34_a
Asuna
406300201_33_a
Yeah... Hmm... Cool buildings get
a lot of tourists, right? Maybe we
need one as a town symbol?
Yuuki
406300201_32_a
Leafa
406300201_31_a
If you're making a tourist
destination, you need something
unique to pull people in.
Sinon
406300201_30_a
Leafa
406300201_29_a
Silica
406300201_28_a
Ah. Good call.
Sinon
406300201_27_a
Everyone agrees we need some sort
of zazz to sell it and get people
coming... But what would work?
Yuuki
406300201_26_a
Asuna
406300201_25_a
Not if we want people in it.
We're building it way up here in
the middle of nowhere.
Yuuki
406300201_24_a
Sinon
406300201_23_a
Silica
406300201_22_a
What sort of town? Like, can't we
just make, you know...a town?
Leafa
406300201_21_a

406300201_20_a
I think that's part of it, but the
real problem is nobody can agree
on what sort of town to build...
Asuna
406300201_19_a
Leafa
406300201_18_a
I guess...not many people were
interested in a player-run event?
Silica
406300201_17_a
And where is everyone?
There's almost nobody here...
Silica
406300201_16_a
Sinon
406300201_15_a
Silica
406300201_14_a
Did...I miss something? We haven't
even started yet, and everyone's
in gloom and doom mode.
Leafa
406300201_13_a
Yuuki
406300201_12_a
Oh, hey girls...
Thanks for coming...
Asuna
406300201_11_a
Leafa
406300201_9_a
Hey, you two. Sorry we're late.
Sinon

Yuuki
406300201_7_a

Asuna
406300201_6_a
What a world.
A cruel, non-town building world.
Player C
406300201_5_a
Yeaaah. Saw this coming. This
is what happens when you try 
to build a town with no plan.
Player B

...
Player A
406300201_1_a
You said it!
Asuna
406300101_22_a
It'll be a breeze compared to
doing this stuff in the real
world. But the more the merrier!
Yuuki
406300101_21_a
I'll message everyone and see if
they're interested too. This is
going to be a big job!
Asuna
406300101_20_a
You betcha!
Yuuki
406300101_19_a
you and me just have to
participate! Isn't that right?
Asuna
406300101_18_a
If we've got a player-run event
going down in the land between
our territories,
Asuna
406300101_17_a
I knew it! But I'm still happy to
help, Yuuki.
Asuna
406300101_16_a
Hahaha, you got me figured out!
Yuuki
406300101_15_a
Hehe, you're even more excited
now, aren't you? You're all about
the thrills.
Asuna
406300101_14_a
Oh, I totally didn't even think
about that! Guess I'll sleep with
one eye open there! Hahaha!
Yuuki
406300101_13_a
That means monsters can attack
and hurt people. Are you still
okay with this idea?
Asuna
406300101_12_a
it may look like a town, but the
system won't recognize it as a
safe zone.
Asuna
406300101_11_a
But there's one big problem:
even if we clear the land and
put up buildings,
Asuna
406300101_10_a
I have heard about small towns
trying to rebrand themselves as
tourist destinations...
Asuna
406300101_9_a
So I guess someone got the idea
into their head to do that here
in VR too!
Yuuki
406300101_8_a
Yeah! Lots of people are trying to
revitalize the countryside in the
real world...
Yuuki
406300101_7_a
That sounds like a fun idea!
It's like being a pioneer!
Asuna
406300101_6_a
So someone thought, "Hey! Let's
build a town up there, see what
happens!"
Yuuki
406300101_5_a
There aren't many great quests or
rare items to find up there, so
not many people go out that way...
Yuuki
406300101_4_a
Yeah, that's what I hear. Know
those mountains between
Undine and Imp territory?
Yuuki
406300101_3_a
Yuuki
406300101_2_a
bg_21_alne
There's a player-run event to
build a town?
Asuna
406300101_1_a
Thank you both. That means a lot.
Arianrhod
406201201_30_a
So am I!
Asuna
406201201_29_a
I'm here for you.
Kirito
406201201_28_a
I see what you mean. Let us
know if there's anything we
can do to help with that.
Kirito
406201201_27_a
He trained me and gave me courage.
I feel I should carry on the positive
aspects of his legacy.
Arianrhod
406201201_26_a
The world that literally grew
from the seed he provided...
That's enough for me.
Arianrhod
406201201_25_a
As long as people are enjoying
themselves in the world Kayaba
created...
Arianrhod
406201201_24_a
And it wouldn't deter me from
doing what I feel I must.
Arianrhod
406201201_23_a
I'm so sorry...
Asuna
406201201_22_a
Ha ha! I don't mind either way.
Praise now won't change what
came before.
Arianrhod
406201201_21_a
Isn't it equally possible he
wanted to see how strong his
student had become? Hmm?
Asuna
406201201_20_a
I think you're selling Arianrhod
a bit short here, Kirito.
Asuna
406201201_19_a
It would've been incredibly easy
for him to slip into an avatar he
helped train.
Kirito
406201201_18_a
That's possible. Not to mention
you were his pupil.
Kirito
406201201_17_a
Isn't it possible he chose my
avatar to possess because it's
closest to what he played?
Arianrhod
406201201_16_a
Heh, you're right about that.
But if you think about it...
Arianrhod
406201201_15_a
That was pretty standard SAO
difficulty, though, wasn't it?
Asuna
406201201_14_a
Ha ha, it's not a bad idea, but I
think you're getting into
conspiracy theory territory.
Asuna
406201201_13_a
As a way to jolt us out of the
stupor all the easy quests had
lulled us into?
Kirito
406201201_12_a
You don't think he whipped that
whole quest up for us, do you?
Kirito
406201201_11_a
Come to think of it, the admins
never made an announcement about
SAO monsters appearing, did they?
Kirito
406201201_10_a
Maybe that's why he felt he had
to come back. To push people to
the next level.
Arianrhod
406201201_9_a
On the one hand, that's obviously
because it's not a battle between
life and death anymore.
Arianrhod
406201201_8_a
Nobody's really aiming as high
as they could.
Arianrhod
406201201_7_a
And players are kind of in a rut
at the moment.
Arianrhod
406201201_6_a
He's right, though. The stakes
aren't as high in ALO.
Arianrhod
406201201_5_a
He sounded rather satisfied
in the end.
Asuna
406201201_4_a
Asuna
406201201_3_a
Kirito
406201201_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Ah, I see...
Arianrhod
406201201_1_a
Of course not.
Kirito
406201101_19_a
Would you mind telling me what
he said to you?
Arianrhod
406201101_18_a
That's certainly what it felt
like to me.
Kirito
406201101_17_a
You said it seemed like Heathcliff
possessed me, or something?
Arianrhod
406201101_16_a
I'd like to ask you something
about that battle the other day.
Arianrhod
406201101_15_a
Thank you, Kirito.
Arianrhod
406201101_14_a
That...he wasn't just the mad
scientist most of the world
thinks he was.
Kirito
406201101_13_a
I feel the same way about Kayaba.
Kirito
406201101_12_a
I'll never know whether that was
true, of course, but it helps me
sleep at night.
Arianrhod
406201101_11_a
Some part of him wanted out.
Wanted to end the world he'd
created.
Arianrhod
406201101_10_a
He built me up so I could have
a hand in ending that death game.
Arianrhod
406201101_9_a
But it's more complicated than
that, too.
Arianrhod
406201101_8_a
I'm so sorry...
Asuna
406201101_7_a
That the one person I trusted
in that world was the same one
who imprisoned me in it.
Arianrhod
406201101_6_a
I returned to the real world only
to be shocked by the revelation
that Kayaba was Heathcliff.
Arianrhod
406201101_5_a
I was off completing quests on my
own when I got the message that
the game had been beaten.
Arianrhod
406201101_4_a
Kirito
406201101_3_a
Asuna
406201101_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
That was the last time I saw him.
Arianrhod
406201101_1_a
Yes.
Arianrhod
406201001_36_a
Now then, shall we head back?
Heathcliff 
406201001_35_a
Ha ha, you certainly have a way
with words.
Heathcliff 
406201001_34_a
Like you're some sort of admin
or something.
Arianrhod
406201001_33_a
You just speak as though you can
see everything that's going on
in this place.
Arianrhod
406201001_32_a
What is the matter?
Heathcliff 
406201001_31_a
Heh...
Arianrhod
406201001_30_a
Your presence would be most
appreciated on quests that large
parties cannot complete.
Heathcliff 
406201001_29_a
There are several more mini-quests
and other missions that also need
to be completed.
Heathcliff 
406201001_28_a
Advancing through the floors isn't
just about fighting on the front
lines.
Heathcliff 
406201001_27_a
&XK
The Assault Team wouldn't accept
me if I joined now.
Arianrhod
406201001_26_a
&XK
I've already been branded
a coward.
Arianrhod
406201001_25_a
You've been a valuable asset to
the Assault Team, and you should
keep fighting to complete SAO.
Heathcliff 
406201001_24_a
Nothing at all. I am delighted
with your progress.
Heathcliff 
406201001_23_a
What?
Arianrhod
406201001_22_a
Though I did fear all was lost...
Heathcliff 
406201001_21_a
Ha ha, just as I anticipated.
Heathcliff 
406201001_20_a
I-I'm not sure. I was too
focused on the attack.
Arianrhod
406201001_19_a
Ari, did you just...cancel
your stagger?
Heathcliff 
406201001_18_a
I-I did it!

end for me.
Heathcliff

E"6
Whether you believe it or not,
I wouldn't lie to you.
Heathcliff 
406200901_29_a
E"6
How can you be so sure?!
Arianrhod
406200901_28_a
E"6
Ha ha. That won't be a problem.
I guarantee it.
Heathcliff 
406200901_27_a
E"6
How could I ever forgive myself if
I was the reason we lost you?
Could I even face the others?
Arianrhod
406200901_26_a
E"6
Which means any failure of mine
would endanger you too.
Arianrhod
406200901_25_a
E"6
You're not asking me to fight for
myself anymore. You want my help.
Arianrhod
406200901_24_a
E"6
How so?
Heathcliff 
406200901_23_a
E"6
But the fear hasn't gone away.
It's just changed.
Arianrhod
406200901_22_a
E"6
and gained the tools necessary
to make it out of here alive.
Arianrhod
406200901_21_a
E"6
Thanks to you, I've learned how
to fight through my fear
Arianrhod
406200901_20_a
E"6
Look, I thank you for all the
training and guidance...
Arianrhod
406200901_19_a
E"6
Yes.
Heathcliff 
406200901_18_a
E"6
And I take it you want me to join
you on this quest?

Arianrhod
406200901_15_a
E"6
It shall be completed by tomorrow
afternoon. Don't you worry.
Heathcliff 
406200901_14_a
E"6
Are you sure? I certainly don't
mind, but...
Asuna
406200901_13_a
E"6
I have someone in mind.
Leave this quest to me, Asuna.
Heathcliff 
406200901_12_a
E"6
Tanks? Hmm... Meaning you with
the power of the Divine Blade,
and...who else?
Asuna
406200901_11_a
E"6
They wouldn't take any damage from
the monsters' quick-but-weak
attacks.
Heathcliff 
406200901_10_a
E"6
I think this would be best suited
for two tanks with high defense.
Heathcliff 
406200901_9_a
E"6
But with my high agility...
Asuna
406200901_8_a
E"6
Taking them out one by one would
be a risky and life-threatening
task. They'll chip away at our HP.
Heathcliff 
406200901_7_a
E"6
No. This area will spawn a lot of
fast-moving monsters.
Heathcliff 
406200901_6_a
E"6
I think that leaves us no choice
but to complete this quest
together. What do you say?
Asuna
406200901_5_a
E"6
But the party size is capped at
two players.
Asuna
406200901_4_a
E"6
So it would seem. Defeating these
monsters weakens the boss.

Commander, this mini-quest may not
appear related to completing the
game, but it cannot be ignored.
Asuna
406200901_1_a
Parting words...
Asuna
406200801_22_a
I got very much the same sense
from his parting words to me.
Arianrhod
406200801_21_a
He kind of did, didn't he?
Asuna
406200801_20_a
He sounded strangely...fulfilled.
Kirito
406200801_19_a
I mean, I can't claim to
understand Kayaba completely,
but when it was all over...
Kirito
406200801_18_a
You do?
Asuna
406200801_17_a
I think I see where she's
coming from.
Kirito
406200801_16_a
Why would he want to train someone
who could destroy it?
Asuna
406200801_15_a
I mean, he built that entire
world.
Asuna
406200801_14_a
Doesn't that go against everything
he stood for?
Asuna
406200801_13_a
...
Kirito
406200801_12_a
You can't be serious!
Asuna
406200801_11_a
I think he wanted to train those
of us with the potential to
best him.
Arianrhod
406200801_10_a
Thinking back on it, Heathcliff-
Kayaba, I mean-was choosing
the strongest among us.
Arianrhod
406200801_9_a
And given the way he spoke about
it, I likely wasn't the only one.
Arianrhod
406200801_8_a
All that time he must have been
training you.
Asuna
406200801_7_a
Come to think of it, after a while
there were times when he'd seem
to just disappear.
Asuna
406200801_6_a
I had no idea he did that.
Kirito
406200801_5_a
His sword and large shield matched
my style, and I learned much from
him in the end.

specifically. I just want people

Arianrhod

I would have intervened at once.
Heathcliff

What would you have done if things
hadn't gone my way?
Arianrhod
406200701_9_a

I didn't need to. You defeated it
handily. See? You have the skills.
Doesn't that inspire confidence?
Heathcliff 
406200701_8_a

Wh-Why would you lie?!
And why didn't you lift a finger
when I'm supposedly your backup?
Arianrhod

Come again?! You said it would
be a total pushover, even at my
level!
Arianrhod
406200701_6_a

a monster most would need another
five levels to defeat.

After all, if not for the threat
of death,
Heathcliff 
406200601_28_a
And, of course, you want the
rules changed.
Heathcliff 
406200601_27_a
You know why. You just need a
little confidence. You must prove
to yourself that you can survive.
Heathcliff 
406200601_26_a
Why are you pushing me to fight?

Heathcliff 
406200601_22_a
Ah, you need not concern yourself
with him.
Heathcliff 
406200601_21_a
Who?
Arianrhod
406200601_20_a
There are those who flourish
outside guilds too. One young
man comes to mind.
Heathcliff 
406200601_19_a
What?
Arianrhod
406200601_18_a
Not exactly, no.
Heathcliff 
406200601_17_a
I get it! You want me in your
guild!
Arianrhod
406200601_16_a
And it breaks my heart whenever
I see a gamer shut themselves away
in a safe zone.
Heathcliff 
406200601_15_a
But I know you have the skill.
I can tell you're a gamer.
Heathcliff 
406200601_14_a
Urgh...
Arianrhod
406200601_13_a
Keep believing you're not worthy,
and you'll fall behind the others.
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Heathcliff 
406200601_12_a
Oh!
Arianrhod
406200601_11_a
That tells me you want to get
out there.
Heathcliff 
406200601_10_a
You wouldn't spend your nights
training out of view if that were
true.
Heathcliff 
406200601_9_a
I have a hard time believing that.
Heathcliff 
406200601_8_a
Well, I don't want you to get the
wrong idea about me. I'm a coward,
plain and simple.
Arianrhod
406200601_7_a
Yeah, I know what you want.
You want me to join your guild,
is that right?
Arianrhod
406200601_6_a
Heh, how cold. And here I was just
making the rounds, checking on my
front-line soldiers.
Heathcliff 
406200601_5_a
You again...
You're incorrigible.
Arianrhod
406200601_4_a
Hmm, I'd like to see a little more
dexterity from a tank.
Heathcliff 
406200601_3_a
huff

Yes, sir!

406200501_15_a
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
Best of luck with your mission.
Heathcliff 
406200501_14_a
Wh-What's so funny, Commander?
Asuna
406200501_13_a
Ha ha!
Heathcliff 
406200501_12_a
I'll contact him, but I can't make
any guarantees. He marches to
the beat of his own drum.
Asuna
406200501_11_a
Have you persuaded the Black
Swordsman to join you?
Heathcliff 
406200501_10_a
Heh. I should have known you'd be
so prepared.
Heathcliff 
406200501_9_a
The solo players and members who
belong to other guilds have given
me their consent.
Asuna
406200501_8_a
The list has been uploaded.
I just need your approval.
Asuna
406200501_7_a
I've already chosen my candidates.
Asuna
406200501_6_a
Very well. I shall leave the
party's composition up to you.
Heathcliff 
406200501_5_a
I would like to lead a party into
battle against the boss.
Asuna
406200501_4_a
Right. We have located the field
boss we must defeat in order
to open the floor boss's dungeon.
Asuna
406200501_3_a
I had some minor business to
attend to. What's your status?
Heathcliff 
406200501_2_a

Q 6
You shall see me again.
Heathcliff 
406200401_37_a
Q 6
I'm afraid I must take my leave.
Urgent business with the council.
Heathcliff 
406200401_36_a
Q 6
Oh!
Heathcliff 
406200401_35_a
Q 6
Why?
Arianrhod
406200401_34_a
Q 6
Perceptive, I see.
Yes, I've been evaluating
you for the last few days.
Heathcliff 
406200401_33_a
Q 6
So what does a guild commander
want with me? From the way you
talk, you've seen me practice.
Arianrhod
406200401_32_a
Q 6
Yes, I'm sure you've heard the
name. I've been working hard
to promote it.
Heathcliff 
406200401_31_a
Q 6
Knights of the... You mean the
guild dedicated to beating SAO?
Arianrhod
406200401_30_a
Q 6
You may call me Heathcliff.
I command the guild known as
the Knights of the Blood Oath.
???
406200401_29_a
Q 6
Who are you, anyway?! What do
you gain by provoking me?
Arianrhod
406200401_28_a
Q 6
I find that to be a waste of your
gaming talents.
???
406200401_27_a
Q 6
But I cannot put myself in such
danger until I am ready.
Arianrhod

I-I know that!
Arianrhod
406200401_25_a

You should fight mobs if you
wish to grow stronger.

406200401_24_a
Q 6
Oh!
Arianrhod
406200401_23_a
Q 6
Though I should warn you that
training alone inside the safe
zone won't earn you experience.
???
406200401_22_a
Q 6
Training when most people
are sleeping. That's serious
dedication.
???
406200401_21_a
Q 6
Hm?! Wh-Who are you?!
Arianrhod
406200401_20_a
Q 6
Well fought. You've got heart.

Asuna
406200401_14_a
Q 6
Not long after that was when
I met him.
Arianrhod
406200401_13_a
Q 6
Not being able to use any of that
skill when it mattered most was
what hurt the worst. I was weak.
Arianrhod
406200401_12_a
Q 6
But my reputation preceded me.
I had worked hard to achieve what
I did.
Arianrhod
406200401_11_a
Q 6
Nobody could blame you.
You certainly weren't alone
in being paralyzed by fear.
Kirito
406200401_10_a
Q 6
I'd been all but forgotten within
the first few weeks of SAO.
Arianrhod
406200401_9_a
Q 6
I crashed to the ground as quickly
as I'd risen to the top. My fans
started leaving.
Arianrhod
406200401_8_a
Q 6
The only move I could make was
to turn and run.
Arianrhod
406200401_7_a
Q 6
But I was utterly paralyzed with
fear in my very first battle.

It's true.
Arianrhod

Anyway, I don't think you'll get
very far with her on your side.
Better give up, guys.
Player C
406200301_21_a
Has SAO exposed you for the
gutless little wimp you really
are?
Player C
406200301_20_a
This isn't just a game anymore.
Player C
406200301_19_a
Say what?! The strongest tank
player cut and run from her first
real fight?!
Player B
406200301_18_a
&XK
...
Arianrhod
406200301_17_a
Are you serious?
Player B
406200301_16_a
And then she panics and runs from
her very first fight!
Player C
406200301_15_a
This savior of yours got
everyone's hopes up as soon as we
heard this was a death game...
Player C
406200301_14_a
You mean you haven't heard?
Player C
406200301_13_a
Hm? What's the problem?
Player A
406200301_12_a
No way, guys. Stop right there.
Player C
406200301_11_a
&XK
No, I can't...
Arianrhod
406200301_10_a
Lucky us, we've found a savior!
We'd love to form a party with
you! Please!
Player A
406200301_9_a
I didn't expect to see you in SAO!
Oh man, we'll be unstoppable with
you in our party!
Player B
406200301_8_a
Yeah! Everyone says she's the
strongest female tank player in
every single MMORPG!
Player B
406200301_7_a
You mean THE Arianrhod?
Player A
406200301_6_a
Wait a minute! Isn't that
Arianrhod, the famous
MMO player?
Player B
406200301_5_a
I, um...
Arianrhod
406200301_4_a
Want to form a party with us and
level up some?
Player A
406200301_3_a
Hey, you look pretty tough.
Player A
406200301_2_a
bg_02_alley
...
Arianrhod
406200301_1_a
It was just a few days after we
all knew we'd been trapped inside
SAO.
Arianrhod
406200201_22_a
Allow me to start from the
beginning.
Arianrhod
406200201_21_a
I see. You two had a rather
complicated relationship with
him, didn't you?
Arianrhod
406200201_20_a
But when I saw you fight for the
first time, I thought he'd come
back from the dead.
Kirito
406200201_19_a
I've been wondering that myself.
If it's an homage to the former
KoB guild, that's fine.
Kirito
406200201_18_a
...
Arianrhod
406200201_17_a
I believe you have your reasons,
and I'd like to know what they
are.
Asuna
406200201_16_a
Aside from the fact that you're
a woman, of course! I just...
It's not a coincidence, is it?
Asuna
406200201_15_a
Oh!
Arianrhod
406200201_14_a
You look a lot like Heathcliff.
Asuna
406200201_13_a
Your fighting style, your armor,
your avatar... It's all modeled
on the former commander.
Asuna
406200201_12_a
Go ahead, Asuna.
Arianrhod
406200201_11_a
May I ask you a question,
Arianrhod?
Asuna
406200201_10_a
...
Asuna
406200201_9_a
Yeah, that's fair. I think you
made the right call.
Kirito
406200201_8_a
and I'm not about to heap needless
responsibility and stress on SAO
survivors.
Arianrhod
406200201_7_a
Everyone had been playing ALO with
their own friends before I found
them,
Arianrhod
406200201_6_a
The guild was hastily formed and
did what it set out to do. I saw
no reason to keep it running.
Arianrhod
406200201_5_a
There were some disappointed
faces, but most were
understanding.
Arianrhod

Arianrhod
406200201_3_a

Did any of the other members
object to disbanding the guild?
Kirito
406200201_1_a
Thank you, that would be lovely.
Arianrhod
406200101_28_a
I was just about to make some tea.
I'll pour you some if you'd like.
Asuna
406200101_27_a
Yeah, it got pretty messy.
Please, come in!
Asuna
406200101_26_a
You were by my side the entire
time, but I hardly had a chance
to speak with you.
Arianrhod
406200101_25_a
I'm visiting today to thank you,
and also to apologize.
Arianrhod
406200101_24_a
I see...
Kirito
406200101_23_a
And to that end, the KoB fulfilled
its purpose, so I disbanded it.
Arianrhod
406200101_22_a
Thanks to your efforts, we
defeated the SAO monsters that ran
amok in ALO's recreated Aincrad.
Arianrhod
406200101_21_a
Really?
Asuna
406200101_20_a
After all, I am no longer the
commander.
Arianrhod
406200101_19_a
Ha ha, pardon my intrusion.
And please, drop the formalities.
Arianrhod
406200101_18_a
Asuna
406200101_17_a
Arianrhod
406200101_16_a
Who was-whoa! The new commander
of the Knights of the Blood Oath?!
Kirito
406200101_15_a
Arianrhod
406200101_14_a
N-No, not at all!
Please come in.
Asuna
406200101_13_a
I'd heard your house was around
here, so I thought I'd stop in.
Is that a problem?
Arianrhod
406200101_12_a
C-Commander Arianrhod?!
Asuna
406200101_11_a
Hey there.
Arianrhod
406200101_9_a
Asuna

Coming!
Asuna

Sounds like someone's at the door.
Kirito
406200101_6_a
Hm? What was that?
Asuna

Hmm, okay.

Kirito

I'd call it more of a hunch...
Asuna

I suspect it's due to the immense
power they contain, but perhaps
you have a different theory?
Eugeo

Why do Urdr's Divine Objects
attract these monsters?

they speak the truth.

Rain
406001201_10_a
That is rather incontrovertible
proof.
Leprechaun B
406001201_8_a
It was then that I saw monsters
crawling up from the swamp as
light emanated from the Object.
Leprechaun A
406001201_7_a
She could have easily left me to
die and made off with the Object,
but she saved me instead.
Leprechaun A
406001201_6_a
I did.
Leprechaun A
406001201_5_a
So you saw monsters spawning in
response to the Object's power
when Alice saved your life?

as we have described?

We wish to further research the
Divine Object ourselves.
Leprechaun B
406001101_26_a
If not, then I'm afraid we shall
be forced to cease negotiating.
Leprechaun B
406001101_25_a
Do you have any proof that you are
not deceiving us? Or anyone who
will vouch for your bold claims?
Leprechaun B
406001101_24_a
Hmph! B-But
Leprechaun C

Of course, you'll also run the
risk of sustaining heavy
casualties...
Kirito

Monsters like the ones you just
saw will continue to spawn here.

If it's proof you want, then leave
the Divine Object here.

406001101_16_a
Kirito and his friends would do
no such thing!
Rain
406001101_15_a
This could all be an elaborate
hoax meant to trick us into
turning it over!
Leprechaun C
406001101_14_a
Just a moment! We have not
definitively proven that the
Object is the cause!
Leprechaun C
406001101_13_a
Rain
406001101_12_a
You're right. That's why we should
hand the Divine Object over to
Liz
406001101_11_a
Asuna
406001101_9_a
We must protect the lord
at all costs!
Leprechaun B
406001101_8_a
Eugeo
406001101_10_a
That would be most troubling.
It's so close to the lord's estate!
Leprechaun B
406001101_7_a
I'm confident that monsters of
that caliber will spawn here as
long as you hold the Object.
Kirito
406001101_6_a
Certainly something caused them to
appear. We've never seen monsters
like that before.
Leprechaun C
406001101_5_a
Eugeo
406001101_4_a
Asuna
406001101_3_a
Kirito
406001101_2_a
bg_event_corridor
Hmm, so the Divine Object caused
those monsters to appear...
Leprechaun B
406001101_1_a
Eugeo
406001001_61_a
Kirito
406001001_60_a
We're counting on you, Liz!
Asuna
406001001_59_a
Rain
406001001_58_a
Agreed. I'll pitch it to the
higher-ups and see what
they say!
Liz
406001001_57_a
Yeah, that's great leverage!
We should try again!
Rain
406001001_56_a
Rain
406001001_55_a
Good point... We might be able to
work that angle!
Liz
406001001_54_a
Eugeo
406001001_53_a
Asuna
406001001_52_a
Do you really want to hold onto
the Divine Object at the risk of
more monster attacks?
Kirito
406001001_51_a
Eugeo
406001001_50_a
Asuna
406001001_49_a
So what do you say? Can we revisit
our negotiations based on this new
information?
Kirito
406001001_48_a
Rain
406001001_47_a
...
Liz
406001001_46_a
Asuna
406001001_45_a
Kirito
406001001_44_a
I think so. We've seen it each and
every time on our quest to collect
them.
Eugeo
406001001_43_a
Rain
406001001_42_a
So whoever has a Divine Object
attracts this nasty-looking horde
of monsters?
Liz
406001001_41_a
Eugeo
406001001_40_a
Asuna
406001001_39_a
That's what Eugeo thinks,
and I'm pretty sure he's right.
Kirito
406001001_38_a
Liz
406001001_37_a
Hm?
Rain
406001001_36_a
Eugeo
406001001_35_a
Kirito
406001001_34_a
Liz, Rain. We think the appearance
of these monsters might be related
to the Divine Objects!
Asuna
406001001_33_a
Eugeo
406001001_32_a
Asuna
406001001_31_a
I see...
Kirito
406001001_30_a
Rain
406001001_29_a
We marshaled our best soldiers
when we moved to protect the vault,
but this is on another level!
Liz
406001001_28_a
Rain
406001001_27_a
We're in total disarray!
Liz
406001001_26_a
Eugeo
406001001_25_a
Kirito
406001001_24_a
How are the Leprechauns doing?
Asuna
406001001_23_a
Eugeo
406001001_22_a
Asuna
406001001_21_a
No problem!
Kirito
406001001_20_a
Liz
406001001_19_a
Yeah! Thanks for helping us take
out these monsters!
Rain
406001001_18_a
Eugeo

Kirito
406001001_16_a
Are you guys okay?

Eugeo

H-Here it comes!
Leprechaun A
406000901_27_a
GRAAAAAHHHH!
Monster
406000901_26_a
At last, I can move as I please!
Alice
406000901_25_a
Whew...
Alice
406000901_24_a
O-Okay! I suppose I am left
with no choice!
Leprechaun A
406000901_23_a
Quickly!
Alice
406000901_22_a
Growwwlll!
Monster
406000901_21_a
Erm, well...
Leprechaun A
406000901_20_a
You're a Leprechaun, are you not?
Surely you can unlock them!
Alice
406000901_19_a
Free me from these chains
if you wish to live!
Alice
406000901_18_a
Hm?
Leprechaun A
406000901_17_a
You there! Leprechaun!
Alice
406000901_16_a
...
Alice
406000901_15_a
Graaaah!
Monster
406000901_14_a
Urgh!
Leprechaun A
406000901_13_a
It's now or never!
Alice
406000901_12_a
Could this Divine Object be
calling forth the Forces of
Darkness?
Alice
406000901_11_a
What the
! What are monsters
doing here?!
Leprechaun A
406000901_10_a
GRAAAAWRRRR!
Monster
406000901_9_a
What is this light emanating from
the Divine Object?
Alice
406000901_8_a
Hm?
Alice
406000901_7_a
Curses! They found me.
Alice
406000901_6_a
You there! What are you doing!
Leprechaun A
406000901_5_a
item_event_sacred_treasure
I must get to the vault and secure
the Divine Object!
Alice
406000901_4_a
The Forces of Darkness have thrown
this place into chaos, meaning the
guards have left their posts...
Alice
406000901_3_a
There's no way I can call Amayori
in this weather either... But it
looks like I was right.
Alice
406000901_2_a
bg_event_corridor
Urgh... Huff... It's so hard
to move in these chains...
Alice
406000901_1_a
R-Right!
Rain
406000801_26_a
We can find out why later!
We've got people to defend!
Liz
406000801_25_a
Good question! There's got to be
a reason.
Liz
406000801_24_a
What are these things?!
And why are they spawning here?!
Rain
406000801_23_a
Wh-What the heck?
Liz
406000801_22_a
Graaawwwrrr!

406000801_16_a
Ha ha, glad to hear it!
Kirito
406000801_15_a
Heh, you don't have to tell me
twice! I wasn't cut out to be a
thief, anyway!
Eugeo
406000801_14_a
I'm right there with you.
Give us a hand, Eugeo!
Kirito
406000801_13_a
Enemies or not, we can't just
leave them to die!
Asuna
406000801_12_a
We've got to help the Leprechauns!
Asuna
406000801_11_a
Looks like you were onto
something...
Kirito
406000801_10_a
The Divine Object's power must be
attracting them!
Eugeo
406000801_9_a
The premises of a lord's estate
are usually safe zones...
Which means
Kirito
406000801_8_a
I thought Liz said monsters
hardly ever spawn here!
Asuna
406000801_7_a
Monsters are coming out of
the swamp!
Kirito
406000801_6_a
Augh!
Leprechaun
406000801_5_a
Eugeo
406000801_4_a
Kirito

bg_event_swamp
Graaaaaagh!
Monster
406000801_1_a
Oh?
Liz
406000701_26_a
We've got a problem!
Leprechaun
406000701_25_a
Yep! Here we are...
What's going on?
Liz
406000701_24_a
Liz
406000701_23_a
Rain
406000701_22_a
There you are!
Leprechaun
406000701_21_a
...
Alice
406000701_20_a
We'll think of a way out of this.
Oh, and keep quiet!
Rain
406000701_19_a
Just stay here, Alice!
Don't move a muscle!
Rain
406000701_18_a
Oh, shoot! Someone's coming!
Liz
406000701_17_a
Lisbeth! Rain! Are you there?
Leprechaun
406000701_16_a
Heh, I thought as much.
Rain
406000701_15_a
I make no guarantees.
Alice
406000701_14_a
Hah! Only if you promise not to
raise hell when we do.
Rain
406000701_13_a
You may start by releasing me from
these chains!
Alice
406000701_12_a
But we're still Leprechauns, so we
have to make it look like we're
still on their side.
Liz
406000701_11_a
...It is indeed.
Alice
406000701_10_a
It's important to you and Eugeo,
isn't it?
Liz
406000701_9_a
Well, you're not. We really do
want you to have the Divine
Object.
Liz
406000701_8_a
You speak as though I am not
entirely your enemy...
Alice
406000701_7_a
You're right about that...
Liz
406000701_6_a
That'll make it even harder for
Kirito and the others to get the
Divine Object.
Rain
406000701_5_a
If the other Leprechauns find out
we captured Alice, they'll use
her as a bargaining chip.
Rain
406000701_4_a
Alice
406000701_3_a
Liz
406000701_2_a
bg_event_corridor
So... What's the plan now, Liz?
Rain
406000701_1_a
It works as intended, yes.
You Leprechauns are quite
powerful.
Alice
406000601_44_a
Hehe, pretty handy, huh?
It's a true Leprechaun original!
Rain
406000601_43_a
I can't use Enhance Armament
or any of the Sacred Arts...
Alice
406000601_42_a
These chains are keeping my powers
at bay, aren't they?
Alice
406000601_41_a
we're all at war with each other.
We can't start playing favorites.
Liz
406000601_40_a
So aside from the fact that every
race in the game is after these
Divine Objects,
Liz
406000601_39_a
You know we can't do that, Alice.
We may be Kirito's friends, but
we're still Leprechauns.
Liz
406000601_38_a
What good fortune is there in
being captured?! Release these
chains right this instant!
Alice
406000601_37_a
Just consider yourself lucky that
Liz and I were the ones to find
you!
Rain
406000601_36_a
Bingo!
Liz
406000601_35_a
So, that strange force that
captured me was fairy magic!
Alice
406000601_34_a
You're strong, Alice, I'll give you
that. But you don't get Alfheim's
magic. That's your Achilles heel.
Liz
406000601_33_a
Well well, looks like we caught
ourselves an Alice!
Liz
406000601_32_a
Rain
406000601_31_a
Liz
406000601_30_a
bg_event_corridor
Ungh...
Alice
406000601_29_a
Hm, you may have a point there...
Kirito
406000601_28_a
If only we could prove it, I can't
imagine they'd insist on holding
onto the Divine Object.
Eugeo
406000601_27_a
That's my theory, yes.
Eugeo
406000601_26_a
Eugeo, are you suggesting the
power of the Divine Objects
attracts monsters?
Kirito
406000601_25_a
Yeah, the enemies from Jotunheimr
are tough. And let's not forget
the whale creature we fought!
Asuna
406000601_24_a
What!
Kirito
406000601_23_a
or what you call monsters,
mobilize when our battles
involve the Divine Objects.
Eugeo
406000601_22_a
We've seen the awful power of the
Forces of Darkness,
Eugeo
406000601_21_a
We've acquired two Divine Objects
thus far, and in both fights we've
come to understand their power.
Eugeo
406000601_20_a
It's possible...
Kirito
406000601_19_a
They'd have no choice but to hand
it over. Right?
Eugeo
406000601_18_a
but suppose we could get them
to see how dangerous it is.
Eugeo
406000601_17_a
It was. So I understand that the
Leprechauns don't want to give
it away because it's valuable,
Eugeo
406000601_16_a
Eugeo, you were about to say
something earlier. Was it related
to securing the Divine Object?
Kirito
406000601_15_a
...
Kirito
406000601_14_a
I understand.
Eugeo
406000601_13_a
Exactly.
Kirito
406000601_12_a
I'm worried about her too,
but we need a plan.
Asuna
406000601_11_a
Kirito's right. We'll get caught
for sure if we go looking for her.
I'm sorry.
Asuna
406000601_10_a
Eugeo, wait! I know how you feel,
but don't jump into the fire when
we've just escaped the frying pan!
Kirito
406000601_9_a
We must have split up in the
scramble to escape. We have
to find her!
Eugeo
406000601_8_a
Did we lose Alice?!
Asuna
406000601_7_a
What is it? Hey, where's Alice?
Kirito
406000601_6_a
That we did... Wait a minute.
Eugeo
406000601_5_a
I don't know how, but we got away.
Asuna
406000601_4_a
Eugeo
406000601_3_a
Asuna
406000601_2_a
bg_event_swamp
Whew...
Kirito
406000601_1_a
Alice
406000501_30_a
G-Got it!
Eugeo
406000501_29_a
Asuna
406000501_28_a
Hold that thought, Eugeo!
We've gotta run!
Kirito
406000501_27_a
They found us!
Asuna
406000501_26_a
There they are! I've found the
intruders!
Leprechaun
406000501_25_a
Asuna
406000501_24_a
What about?
Kirito
406000501_23_a
Alice
406000501_22_a
You know, I've been wondering...
Eugeo
406000501_21_a
Alice
406000501_20_a
...
Eugeo
406000501_19_a
Asuna
406000501_18_a
And once they've acquired a rare
new item, their pride kicks in and
keeps them from giving it up.
Kirito
406000501_17_a
It's kind of their thing.
Kirito
406000501_16_a
Asuna
406000501_15_a
Well, either way, the Leprechauns
seem particularly obsessed with
acquiring items and weapons.
Kirito
406000501_14_a
Eugeo
406000501_13_a
I'm sorry to say only a fool would
be unaware of that fact.
Alice
406000501_12_a
Which is precisely why we cannot
let it fall into the hands of
the weak.
Alice
406000501_11_a
Then there is no doubt that it
contains the goddess's awesome
power.
Alice
406000501_9_a
Eugeo
406000501_10_a
Kirito
406000501_8_a
They've got a fair number of
patrols out. They really want to
hold onto this Divine Object...
Asuna
406000501_7_a
Asuna
406000501_6_a
Argh, they found us sooner than
I'd hoped they would...
Kirito
406000501_5_a
They can't have gone far!
Search the area!
Leprechaun
406000501_4_a
Asuna
406000501_3_a
Kirito
406000501_2_a
bg_event_corridor
Intruders! They've come to steal
our Divine Object!
Leprechaun
406000501_1_a
Quiet! There's a patrol right
Alice
406000401_62_a
Alice
406000401_61_a
Indeed, I see what you mean.
Eugeo
406000401_60_a
Asuna
406000401_59_a
so if anyone planned to steal
theirs, they'd realize it was us
anyway.
Kirito
406000401_58_a
But I figured Liz and the other
Leprechauns already know we
want the Divine Objects,
Kirito
406000401_57_a
Sure, part of me would love to
play by the rules all the time.
Kirito
406000401_56_a
Asuna
406000401_55_a
Ha ha, you're starting to figure
me out, Eugeo.
Kirito
406000401_54_a
Alice
406000401_53_a
But that's not really your style,
is it?
Eugeo
406000401_52_a
Alice
406000401_51_a
I'm beginning to suspect it would
be better not to have told them
we're coming...
Eugeo
406000401_50_a
Asuna
406000401_49_a
Yeah, I expect they'll have more
patrols than usual. Maybe even
some with reveal magic.
Kirito
406000401_48_a
They'll probably be expecting us
to sneak in, though.
Asuna
406000401_47_a
Asuna
406000401_46_a
It should, yeah.
Kirito
406000401_45_a
Eugeo
406000401_44_a
Will this shadow magic allow you
to sneak into the vault undetected
by the enemy?
Alice
406000401_43_a
Eugeo
406000401_42_a
Are you two truly okay with
this plan?
Alice
406000401_41_a
Asuna
406000401_40_a
bg_event_corridor
...
Kirito
406000401_39_a
Oh...
Kirito
406000401_38_a
I'm pretty sure even Alice and
Eugeo can feel that too.
Asuna
406000401_37_a
Ha ha! Your love of battle is just
so...un-Spriggan of you.
Asuna
406000401_36_a
Asuna
406000401_35_a
Huh? Why'd you all go quiet?
Kirito

Alice
406000401_30_a
Asuna
406000401_29_a
We should split up and infiltrate
their territory at night, which
is my strong suit as a Spriggan.
Kirito
406000401_28_a
Of course not.
Kirito
406000401_27_a
Kirito
406000401_26_a
We don't have the numbers to
attack them head on, though,
do we?
Asuna
406000401_25_a
Eugeo
406000401_24_a
As long as you are comfortable
with the decision, I have no
objections.
Alice
406000401_23_a
Alice
406000401_22_a
I see. So stealing is prohibited
here as well...
Eugeo
406000401_21_a
Asuna
406000401_20_a
It's not sneaky thievery so much
as it is a declaration of war.
We know what we're getting into.
Kirito
406000401_19_a
Besides, they knew this was one
possible outcome when they agreed
to negotiate.
Kirito
406000401_18_a
Asuna
406000401_17_a
Well, we've already told them
we're going to steal it, if that
helps.
Kirito
406000401_16_a
Alice
406000401_15_a
I must admit I don't relish
the idea of playing a thief.
Eugeo
406000401_14_a
Asuna
406000401_13_a
We take it by force.
Get ready to break
into their vault.
Kirito
406000401_12_a
So we take it by force?
Asuna
406000401_11_a
It seems she's already told them
how we intend to respond.
Kirito
406000401_9_a
Asuna
406000401_10_a
Eugeo
406000401_8_a
So? What do we do now?
Alice
406000401_7_a
Asuna
406000401_6_a
Seems they also said any trade of
rare items is also off the table.
Kirito
406000401_5_a
Negotiations failed, just as we
expected they would.
Kirito
406000401_4_a
And? What does it say?
Asuna
406000401_3_a
Asuna
406000401_2_a
bg_event_swamp
I just got a message from Liz.
Kirito
406000401_1_a
I wouldn't get your hopes up,
though.
Liz
406000301_50_a
Thanks!
Kirito
406000301_49_a
Okay, I'll talk to the higher-ups
and see what I can do.
Liz
406000301_48_a
sigh
... Yeah, I hear you.
Liz
406000301_47_a
I'm sorry, Liz.
It's nothing personal.
Asuna
406000301_46_a
Geez, you guys aren't messing
around... I expected that from
Kirito, but not the rest of you...
Liz
406000301_45_a
If the negotiations fall apart,
we'll say that we are prepared
to take it by force.
Kirito
406000301_44_a
Asuna
406000301_43_a
Liz
406000301_42_a
Well, there's no harm in
negotiating. Let's start there.
Kirito
406000301_41_a
Eugeo
406000301_40_a
Alice
406000301_39_a
Believe me, I want to just hand it
over to you guys, but you see the
position we're in...
Rain
406000301_38_a
Kirito
406000301_37_a
Asuna
406000301_36_a
Watch it, Kirito! We're
Leprechauns too, in case
you've forgotten!
Liz
406000301_35_a
Asuna
406000301_34_a
Liz
406000301_33_a
Well, when you put it that way...
It's never totally off the table,
but...
Kirito
406000301_32_a
Rain
406000301_31_a
Eugeo
406000301_30_a
Is battle not an option when
negotiations break down?
Alice
406000301_29_a
Rain
406000301_28_a
Eugeo
406000301_27_a
I'm sorry, is there a truce I am
unaware of? Are the factions of
this world not at war?
Alice
406000301_26_a
Liz
406000301_25_a
Kirito
406000301_24_a
Wait, what?!
Asuna
406000301_23_a
Rain
406000301_22_a
Eugeo
406000301_21_a
Well then. Should negotiations
fail, I suppose you'll not object
to us taking it by force?
Alice
406000301_20_a
Kirito
406000301_19_a
Asuna
406000301_18_a
It's easy for you to say that,
but I can't think of another
item as rare as this one.
Liz
406000301_17_a
Rain
406000301_16_a
Eugeo
406000301_15_a
Suppose we find an item equal in
value and arrange a trade?
Alice
406000301_14_a
Yeah, I don't think you have that
kind of money.
Rain
406000301_13_a
Alice
406000301_12_a
Rain
406000301_11_a
Not even if we give you a bunch of
money? You call it Yuld, right?
Eugeo
406000301_10_a
Kirito
406000301_9_a
Asuna
406000301_8_a
So we won't just hand it over.
Liz
406000301_7_a
Kirito
406000301_6_a
Asuna
406000301_5_a
Well, you see, Alice, we
Leprechauns are really, really
glad we have this thing.

What's so bad about safeguarding
that which is yours? Surely we can
negotiate.
Alice

I know...

Asuna
406000201_59_a

And all they ever say is how
unique and incredible it must be.
Rain
406000201_54_a
Kirito
406000201_53_a
Asuna
406000201_52_a
Especially when they're all anyone
can talk about, like these Divine
Objects.

Eugeo
406000201_50_a

to items and materials.
Rain
406000201_48_a
Eugeo
406000201_47_a
Alice
406000201_46_a
Remember, we're widely known
as a race of blacksmiths...
Rain
406000201_45_a
Asuna
406000201_44_a
Liz
406000201_43_a
I'd ask how tightly it's being
guarded, but I think I already
know the answer...
Kirito
406000201_42_a
Asuna
406000201_41_a
Liz
406000201_40_a
Basically that someone else beat
us to the Divine Object in this
territory.
Kirito
406000201_39_a
Rain
406000201_38_a
Eugeo
406000201_37_a
What does she mean by that?
Alice
406000201_36_a
Kirito
406000201_35_a
Asuna
406000201_34_a
In a way, this might be your
toughest challenge yet.

406000201_33_a
Oh no is right...

Oh no...

406000201_27_a
Alice
406000201_26_a
It's in a vault on the Leprechaun
lord's premises.

Asuna
406000201_24_a

That'd be great.
Kirito

Now, let's ditch the formalities
so I can show you around our
home turf as a friend!

Oh, please! It's the least we

this way.

Heeeey! Kiritoooo!

406000101_26_a
Asuna
406000101_25_a
I was simply saying that I cannot
abide this place.
Alice
406000101_24_a
W-Well, I didn't quite mean it
like that...
Alice
406000101_23_a
I'm just glad to hear you say you
want to go back to the house...
Asuna
406000101_22_a
What has come over you, Asuna?
Alice
406000101_21_a
Hehehe.
Asuna
406000101_20_a
Asuna
406000101_19_a
Let us find this Divine Object
with all haste so we may leave
this infernal place.
Alice
406000101_18_a
Eugeo
406000101_17_a
Sounds good.
Kirito
406000101_16_a
Asuna
406000101_15_a
I shall permit Amayori to rest,
seeing as we've arrived at our
destination.
Alice
406000101_14_a
Asuna
406000101_13_a
Seems we're not the only ones
who find this place unbearable.
Alice
406000101_12_a
Eugeo
406000101_11_a
Grrrr...
Amayori
406000101_10_a
Yeah, that's true.
Kirito
406000101_9_a
But we're closing in on a Divine
Object, so it's not all bad.
Eugeo
406000101_8_a
Bad weather, high humidity...
It's not an easy place to live.
Kirito
406000101_7_a
Eugeo
406000101_6_a
I'm afraid so. Leprechauns built
their territory in a swamp, after
all.
Kirito
406000101_5_a
Asuna
406000101_4_a
Is the climate in this region
always so oppressive?

Alice

Ha ha, I wouldn't dream of it.
I'll follow your lead, master!
Kirito
405901201_59_a
You're right. And we shouldn't
rest on our laurels now either.
Asuna
405901201_58_a
The most important thing is that
we showed him that we're still
improving.
Kirito
405901201_57_a
Heh heh, everyone's saying the
same thing.
Asuna
405901201_56_a
Ha ha, they really came alive in
the heat of the moment! Heck, that
was my first success with it too.
Kirito
405901201_55_a
I hope so. I'm still in shock that
everyone was able to pull it off
at the last minute!
Asuna
405901201_54_a
He called this game child's play,
but I think our technique showed
him we're still top-tier players.
Kirito
405901201_53_a
It had to be.
He hasn't changed a bit.
Kirito
405901201_52_a
Hey, Kirito... What happened
to Arianrhod back there...
That was him, wasn't it?
Asuna
405901201_51_a

Asuna
405901201_50_a
I see...
Kirito
405901201_49_a
Just as we thought, she has no
memory of the fight.
Asuna
405901201_48_a
Thanks. Arianrhod's finally awake.
Asuna
405901201_47_a
Same to you, Asuna.

Are you sure?!

Formulating a strategy, are we?

Kirito
405901201_17_a
Perfect! Thank you!
Asuna
405901201_16_a
I'll gather the members who have
learned the technique! The greater
the number, the better the odds!
Player C
405901201_15_a
As you wish, Lady Asuna!
We'll do our best!
Player D
405901201_14_a
Imagine you're showing Heathcliff,
our former commander, how powerful
you've become!
Asuna
405901201_13_a
We need all of you to give the
technique another shot!
Asuna

405901201_11_a
Well, you better learn if you

Player D
405901201_9_a
What? Are you going to use the
technique you were trying to teach
us?
Player C
405901201_8_a
We need your help! Watch what
we're about to do and see if you
can copy it!
Kirito
405901201_7_a
Commander Arianrhod isn't herself!
Player D
405901201_6_a
Lady Asuna! What in the
world is going on?!
Player C
405901201_5_a
We have to try again! It's the
only attack that's got a shot at
landing!
Kirito
405901201_4_a
B-But it got blocked last time!
Asuna
405901201_3_a

Asuna
405901101_55_a
Whoa!
Kirito
405901101_54_a
Now then! My turn. See if you can
handle this!
Arianrhod
405901101_53_a
Asuna
405901101_52_a
Urgh!
Kirito
405901101_51_a
Heh, I should have expected as
much from you two. But you've
yet to land the killing blow.
Arianrhod
405901101_50_a
with which you unleash
simultaneous attacks. Difficult
to time, but worth the effort.
Arianrhod
405901101_49_a
thereby taking advantage of the
reduced recovery time the lag in
this world affords you,
Arianrhod
405901101_48_a
Ah, a switching technique where
the player who stepped back then
returns to the fore,
Arianrhod
405901101_47_a
Kirito
405901101_46_a
It got blocked?!

Yes! Now get ready to use that
technique of yours!
Kirito
405901101_33_a
Kirito
405901101_32_a
Kirito, is that who I think it is?
Asuna
405901101_31_a
I see. Indeed, it registers only
as a physical attack. You'll need
more than that to stop me!
Arianrhod
405901101_30_a
Yeah, Skill Connect! But it has
no magic, so it's only half as
effective!
Kirito
405901101_29_a
Is this the technique you came up

YAAAAAAH!
Kirito
405901101_25_a
Kirito, no!
Asuna
405901101_24_a
Asuna
405901101_23_a
RRRRAAAAAAAGH!
Kirito
405901101_22_a
I'm only here to push you.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Arianrhod
405901101_21_a
I mean, honestly, what more is
there to say?
Arianrhod
405901101_20_a
Care to have a little battle?
Arianrhod
405901101_19_a
Asuna
405901101_18_a
It is you!
Kirito
405901101_17_a
Asuna
405901101_16_a
No way...!
Kirito
405901101_15_a
The awful past bleeds once more
into the present, where your
commander betrays you anew...
Arianrhod
405901101_14_a
As you see these fools on the
verge of death, you turn to me
and you begin to remember...
Arianrhod
405901101_13_a
Heh. So that's how it is.
Arianrhod
405901101_12_a
Kirito
405901101_11_a
You have to help us defeat them!
Isn't that why you created the
Knights in the first place?
Asuna
405901101_10_a
Especially when there are
monsters left to kill!
Asuna
405901101_9_a
Graaaaah!
Monster
405901101_8_a
Why are you turning on your own
guild members?
Asuna
405901101_7_a
Kirito
405901101_6_a
What are you talking about,
Commander Arianrhod?
Asuna
405901101_5_a
I simply couldn't help myself!
I had to wake them.
Arianrhod
405901101_4_a
Hah! Just think of this as me
poking around because the ghosts
of this place were far too quiet.
Arianrhod
405901101_3_a
Asuna
405901101_2_a
bg_13_boss
I-It has...
Kirito
405901101_1_a
Ah, hello, you two. It's been
quite a while, hasn't it?
Arianrhod
405901001_26_a
Kirito
405901001_25_a
Why are you doing this, Arianrhod?
Asuna
405901001_24_a
Asuna
405901001_23_a
What the hell?!
Kirito
405901001_22_a
Arianrhod
405901001_21_a
HRRRGH!
Player F
405901001_20_a
Arianrhod
405901001_19_a
Hmph!
Arianrhod
405901001_18_a
What are you talking about?
Player F
405901001_17_a
Never forget that.
Arianrhod
405901001_16_a
Yes, "trust us because we're your
allies." That kind of thinking put
people through two years of hell.
Arianrhod
405901001_15_a
W-We're members of the Knights
of the Blood Oath! We're your
allies!
Player F
405901001_14_a
Get a grip, Commander Arianrhod!
Player F
405901001_13_a
...
Arianrhod
405901001_12_a
Asuna
405901001_11_a
That's not Arianrhod!
Kirito
405901001_10_a
C-Commander! What are you doing?!
Player E
405901001_9_a
HNRK! Wh-Why...?!
Player E
405901001_8_a
How could they have broken through
Arianrhod's shield?!
Kirito
405901001_7_a
A scream from the front lines!
Maybe the monsters got someone!
Asuna
405901001_6_a
Say what?!
Kirito
405901001_5_a
Augh!
???
405901001_4_a
I-I can't hear anything.
Are you okay?!
Asuna
405901001_3_a
Asuna
405901001_2_a
bg_13_boss
I just heard someone talking!
Kirito
405901001_1_a
Kirito, what's going on with you?
Asuna
405900901_34_a
What the
?! I know that voice!
Kirito
405900901_33_a
Ask yourself: Are you two truly
happy in this game? Going soft
with this child's play?
???
405900901_32_a
Think of it as your latest
challenge. It'll be entertaining!
???
405900901_31_a
Come, take my hand. Let us wander
the graveyard of your past
misdeeds, so that you may learn...
???
405900901_30_
I... I don't have a good answer
for that.
Kirito
405900901_29_a
Laugh? Who would be laughing in
the middle of a battle?
Asuna
405900901_28_a
Did you hear someone laugh?
Kirito
405900901_27_a
What's wrong, Kirito?
Asuna
405900901_26_a
Huh?
Kirito
405900901_25_
Heh.
???
405900901_24_a
That is pretty nice...
Kirito
405900901_23_a
It reminded me of everything they
taught me in SAO... It was really
touching.
Asuna
405900901_22_a
It gave them a hard time, but they
were determined to master it.
Asuna
405900901_21_a
Yesterday I even tried to teach
a few members my new technique.
Asuna
405900901_20_a
Me too.
Kirito
405900901_19_a
They've taken only the best parts
of the old KoB's culture. That's
something I can get behind.
Asuna
405900901_18_a
It feels like they really want to
help players who are struggling
with ALO.
Asuna
405900901_17_a
Asuna...
Kirito
405900901_16_a
That's why I was hesitant to join.
But being in the heat of battle
with them feels...good, I think.
Asuna
405900901_15_a
Yeah. At first I wasn't sure if I
wanted to re-open the door to all
those memories, good or bad.
Asuna
405900901_14_a
She must really have a strong
connection with them.
Kirito
405900901_13_a
I can't believe she earned the
trust of former KoB members too.
Kirito
405900901_12_a
And more importantly, she seems to
have the respect of her members.
Asuna
405900901_11_a
Arianrhod's leading the guild
flawlessly.
Asuna
405900901_10_a
Aye-aye, Commander!
Players
405900901_9_
Do so! Hold the line, tanks! Don't
let a single one of them through!
Arianrhod
405900901_8_a
Got it! We'll hang back and heal!
Kirito
405900901_7_a
I'll repel every last one of these
attacks, you'll see!
Arianrhod
405900901_6_a
Heh heh, I'm a tank! Surely the
shield gave that much away!
Arianrhod
405900901_5_a
What about you, Arianrhod?!
Asuna
405900901_4_a
Kirito
405900901_3_a
Asuna
405900901_2_a
bg_13_boss
Brace for impact!
Stand back, both of you!
Arianrhod
405900901_1_a
Absolutely. That's why we're here.
Kirito
405900801_39_a
Will you join us?
Arianrhod
405900801_38_a
Indeed! We're on the hunt for
SAO monsters.
Arianrhod
405900801_37_a
Is something happening?
Asuna
405900801_36_a
Please, just call me Arianrhod.
Arianrhod
405900801_35_a
Commander Arianrhod.
Kirito
405900801_34_a
Thank you for your service,
Commander!
Player D
405900801_33_a
C-Commander!
Player C
405900801_32_a
Asuna
405900801_31_a
Could that be me you were
speaking of?
Arianrhod
405900801_30_a
Hehe, I know.
Asuna
405900801_29_a
Having said that, we can assure
you that the new commander is
just and fair.
Player D
405900801_28_a
We have since heard what the
commander did to us, and we
won't stand for it.
Player D
405900801_27_a
Lady Asuna...
Player C
405900801_26_a
Under the commander's guidance...
Asuna
405900801_25_a
I remember when we donned our red
and white outfits and swore we
would beat SAO.
Asuna
405900801_24_a
Thank you. Your manner of speaking
certainly takes me back.
Asuna
405900801_23_a
That's a blood oath!
Player D
405900801_22_a
Your secret is safe with us.
Player D
405900801_21_a
It would cause pandemonium if
people found out you were here!
Player D
405900801_20_a
I feel the same! You two are quite
famous among the SAO survivors.
Player D
405900801_19_a
As you wish, Lady Asuna!
I wouldn't dream of trampling
on the trust we've built!
Player C
405900801_18_a
Please don't go spreading that
around, though. I don't even want
my presence advertised, really...
Asuna
405900801_17_a
Yeah.
Kirito
405900801_16_a
Y-You came to ALO?
Player D
405900801_15_a
Yes! This is Kirito, the Black
Swordsman himself.
Asuna
405900801_14_a
Lady Asuna, could this dark-haired
youngster be...?
Player C
405900801_13_a
Oh come on, quit building walls
around yourself!
Asuna
405900801_12_a
Nah, I'm good. The KoB members
never really liked me that much,
anyway.
Kirito
405900801_11_a
Come over here and talk with
everyone, Kirito.
Asuna
405900801_10_a
...
Kirito
405900801_9_a
Nor did I!
Asuna
405900801_8_a
I'm thrilled! I never thought we
would fight alongside one another
again.
Player D
405900801_7_a
Oh, but I insist on it!
Player D
405900801_6_a
I believe you outrank me now,
after all.
Asuna
405900801_5_a
And you as well, ha ha!
But please, drop the "Lady"!
Asuna
405900801_4_a
Kirito
405900801_3_a
Asuna
405900801_2_a
bg_12_bi_palace
Lady Asuna! How good to see you!
Player C
405900801_1_a
Thanks, everyone!
Asuna
405900701_30_a
Me three, me three! Keep me in
mind if you ever need one more
for a raid!
Yuuki
405900701_29_a
I'm in your corner too!
Just let me know what
I can do to help!
Silica
405900701_28_a
That's a good point. And if that's
what you want, then I can't stop
you!
Liz
405900701_27_a
I'm starting to wonder if I might
be able to accomplish more
fighting with the KoB.
Asuna
405900701_26_a
Given that not a lot of progress
is being made in the game and my
new technique isn't catching on,
Asuna
405900701_25_a
So what're you gonna tell them?
Leafa
405900701_24_a
It felt like a reunion, in a way.
Asuna
405900701_23_a
No, she wasn't. But I recognized
a number of the other members.
Asuna
405900701_22_a
I mean, it kinda makes sense. She's
an SAO survivor, right? Was she
one of the original Knights?
Liz
405900701_21_a
And the way she cut down an
army of monsters in an instant...
It all reminded me of him.
Asuna
405900701_20_a
I know for a fact the Divine Blade
doesn't exist in ALO, but her
sword and shield were so close...
Asuna
405900701_19_a
She's that good, huh?
Sinon
405900701_18_a
I know. She really made me think
that Heathcliff had come back
to life.
Asuna
405900701_17_a
Arianrhod is already pretty strong
on her own.
Kirito
405900701_16_a
Heh, a part of me also wants to
see who else they've got fighting
for them.
Kirito
405900701_15_a
Never thought I'd hear a solo
player like you say that!
Liz
405900701_14_a
Getting a bunch of experienced
players to work together will make
everything move quickly.
Kirito
405900701_13_a
I'll follow Asuna's lead, but
recruiting SAO players for
their guild was the right call.
Kirito
405900701_12_a
What are your plans, Kirito?
Sinon
405900701_11_a
Whew... You had me going there
for a minute!
Yuuki
405900701_10_a
Ha ha, easy, Yuuki. I'm not going
anywhere. They just want me to
join them temporarily.
Asuna
405900701_9_a
Say what?!
Yuuki
405900701_8_a
So you're leaving the Sleeping
Knights?
Silica
405900701_7_a
Yes... Along with Kirito.
Asuna
405900701_6_a
Whoa, really?
Leafa
405900701_5_a
You got invited to join the new
Knights of the Blood Oath, didn't
you?
Liz
405900701_4_a
Asuna
405900701_3_a
Leafa
405900701_2_a
bg_21_alne
Asuna! I heard all about it!
Liz
405900701_1_a
Of course. I wouldn't want you to
make a decision under duress.
Arianrhod
405900601_21_a
May I have a little more time to
think about it?
Asuna
405900601_20_a
...is that you join us until we
defeat the monsters and return
ALO to normal.
Arianrhod
405900601_19_a
But I want you to understand that
this is by no means a lifelong
commitment. All I ask...
Arianrhod
405900601_18_a
...
Asuna
405900601_17_a
I would be especially honored if
Asuna, already a revered name in
the guild, would join us.
Arianrhod
405900601_16_a
In short, that is why I sought
out players of your caliber.
Arianrhod
405900601_15_a
I see I won't need to explain
everything. Good.
Arianrhod
405900601_14_a
You formed a brand new Knights of
the Blood Oath to take on a brand
new Aincrad.
Kirito
405900601_13_a
That's why I have assembled a
group of fighters I believe are
capable of beating this challenge.
Arianrhod
405900601_12_a
The extra-high difficulty runs
the risk of pushing players away.
Arianrhod
405900601_11_a
Event or not, I don't want this
to go on in ALO for too long.
Arianrhod
405900601_10_a
Precisely.
Arianrhod
405900601_9_a
And then there are players who
have been made complacent by
the recent run of easy quests.
Asuna
405900601_8_a
I can't say I disagree...
Unless, of course, they cut their
teeth on combat as tough as SAO's.
Kirito
405900601_7_a
The fight is now hopeless, and
ALO has become a hellscape.
Arianrhod
405900601_6_a
To hear the weaker ALO players
tell it, flight and magic
their
only powers
have been stolen!
Arianrhod
405900601_5_a
Yes.
Asuna
405900601_4_a
Asuna
405900601_3_a
Kirito
405900601_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
I assume you've heard about the
new Aincrad, SAO monster spawns,
and expanding restriction zones?
Arianrhod
405900601_1_a
I'd be glad to.
Arianrhod
405900501_21_a
Care to explain your guild in a
little more detail while we're
on the subject?
Kirito
405900501_20_a
I'd expect nothing less from the
former vice-commander. That's
why I need you in my guild.
Arianrhod
405900501_19_a
Yes, I was about to say that.
I remember the names and faces
of all those under my command.
Asuna
405900501_18_a
I am. Though as I'm sure you've
realized by now, I was not a
member of the original KoB.
Arianrhod
405900501_17_a
So you're an SAO survivor?
Asuna
405900501_16_a
And congratulate you on completing
the death game that was SAO.
Arianrhod
405900501_15_a
A fact of which I'm well aware.
Surely I may still thank you for
coming?
Arianrhod
405900501_14_a
Ah, just so we're clear, our
coming to meet with you doesn't
mean we're going to join.
Kirito
405900501_13_a
Thank you again for coming.
Arianrhod
405900501_12_a
...
Asuna
405900501_11_a
You don't work your way up the
ranks by being dainty!
Arianrhod
405900501_10_a
Don't worry about it. After all,
the commander of the Knights
should look valiant!
Arianrhod
405900501_9_a
I-I didn't mean to imply anything!
Asuna
405900501_8_a
I have been told I look rather
valiant in battle.
Arianrhod
405900501_7_a
So my fighting style is rather
masculine when viewed from afar?
Arianrhod
405900501_6_a
Ah... He was a she... Ahem...
Asuna
405900501_5_a
Greetings, Commander Arianrhod.

Red armor... A large shield...

We've got to save
huh?
Asuna
405900401_18_a
Kirito, that guy's been
surrounded! He's in real
trouble!
Asuna
405900401_17_a
How many monsters are there?!
And how did they get into the
training grounds?!

Please make your way there!
Player B
405900401_10_a
And we have passed that message
along. The commander awaits you
at the training grounds!
Player A
405900401_9_a
Same here.
Kirito
405900401_8_a
We simply wish to speak with
your commander.
Asuna
405900401_7_a
Forgive me for being blunt, but
we have not decided to join you
just yet.
Asuna

Asuna
405900301_30_a
I think I'd like to find out.
Kirito
405900301_29_a
so the question is, who would take
on the role of commander after
hearing that story?
Kirito
405900301_28_a
I'm sure the original members told
the others about Kayaba disguising
himself as Heathcliff,
Kirito
405900301_27_a
But I know there's no way he could
lead this new group, so it must be
his successor...
Kirito
405900301_26_a
Me too, given the last person to
lead the guild was Kayaba, the
developer of SAO, in disguise.
Kirito
405900301_25_a
Though I'm curious to see who the
new commander is, I suppose.
Asuna
405900301_24_a
I'm not so sure... I don't have
much desire to join them,
honestly.
Asuna
405900301_23_a
So what're you gonna do?
Yuuki
405900301_22_a
...
Asuna
405900301_21_a
Yes! We insist that you meet!
Just once!
Player B
405900301_20_a
Commander, you say?
Asuna
405900301_19_a
We'd love to have you meet our
commander!
Player A
405900301_18_a
Ha ha, easy, guys...
Kirito
405900301_17_a
They've told us all about your
heroic exploits!
Player B
405900301_16_a
Asuna's not the only former KoB
member we count among our ranks!
Player A
405900301_15_a
You were part of the legendary
group that saved everyone,
weren't you?
Player B
405900301_14_a
Heh, well...
Kirito
405900301_13_a
I presume you are one of Asuna's
frien
? N-No way! Are you the
Black Swordsman?!
Player A
405900301_12_a
Would you mind if we took some
time to think about it today?
Kirito
405900301_11_a
I mean, there aren't any rules
against joining more than one
guild...
Kirito
405900301_10_a
Asuna's already a part of our
guild! The Sleeping Knights!
Didn't think about that, did you?
Yuuki
405900301_9_a
I'm hearing an awful lot about
you guys in this conversation!
Yuuki
405900301_8_a
the mysteriously expanding areas
that restrict flight and magic. We
need a former KoB member's skill!
Player B
405900301_7_a
We're facing SAO monsters that
have reappeared in ALO's version
of Aincrad and working to beat
Player B
405900301_6_a
Well...
Asuna
405900301_5_a
Kirito
405900301_4_a
Yuuki
405900301_3_a
Asuna
405900301_2_a
bg_10_field
We would be honored if you would
join our ranks, Asuna.
Player A
405900301_1_a
I'm sure we'll learn a lot more
real soon.
Liz
405900201_16_a
That's highly likely, especially
if they're already such a big
deal.
Liz
405900201_15_a
They might reach out to Asuna
as well.
Silica
405900201_14_a
Rumor has it that the guild counts
some of the original KoB members
among its ranks.
Silica
405900201_13_a
I could see some idiots doing it
as a joke, though...
Liz
405900201_12_a
I hope that's the only reason.
It's a pretty famous name.
Liz
405900201_11_a
Maybe just out of respect?
Some sort of homage to the
original guild?
Sinon
405900201_10_a
They must have chosen that name
on purpose. But why?
Silica
405900201_9_a
They did more to end the death
game than any other guild.
Liz
405900201_8_a
Yeah, and the most powerful one,
to boot.
Liz
405900201_7_a
Which is the guild Asuna belonged
to in SAO.
Sinon
405900201_6_a
KoB for short.
Silica
405900201_5_a
N-No! They're calling themselves
the Knights of the Blood Oath.
Silica
405900201_4_a
Sinon
405900201_3_a
Silica
405900201_2_a
bg_event_field
Wait, are you joking?
Liz
405900201_1_a
What?!
Asuna
405900101_38_a
KoB... That sounds familiar,
now that I think about it...
Leafa
405900101_37_a
I think they called themselves
the, uh...KoB, was it?
Leafa
405900101_36_a
Yeah. They're using cooperation
as a rallying cry, trying to get
players to fight as a unit.
Leafa
405900101_35_a
A whole guild, just for that?
Kirito
405900101_34_a
Oh, did I mention the new guild
that popped up to combat all the
SAO monsters?
Leafa
405900101_33_a
I wish I could explain it better.
Asuna
405900101_32_a
Oh, I wasn't blaming you for
anything. In fact, I'm sorry I
haven't been a better teacher.
Asuna
405900101_31_a
Sorry. I wish I had mastered it
by now as well...
Kirito
405900101_30_a
Hahaha! You would phrase it that
way, Asuna.
Yuuki
405900101_29_a
I think it needs a little more
time in the oven.
Asuna
405900101_28_a
True, though not even Kirito has
fully mastered it yet...
Asuna
405900101_27_a
Theoretically anyone can pull it
off, so it should help some people
out, right?
Yuuki
405900101_26_a
It shouldn't be too bad as long as
we keep spreading the word about
Asuna's new technique.
Yuuki
405900101_25_a
Well, they don't call it a "spike"
for nothing.
Leafa
405900101_24_a
Are we sure this isn't a case of
people whining because of the
new quest's difficulty spike?
Kirito
405900101_23_a
ALO's quests have been pretty
easy, though, haven't they?
Kirito
405900101_22_a
It sounds like everyone has
similar concerns.
Asuna
405900101_21_a
We're basically stuck relying on
switches now. Sounds like it'll
be tough.
Leafa
405900101_20_a
It also seems like the areas that
prevent flight and magic use are
expanding.
Leafa
405900101_19_a
Gotcha. So it's happening
everywhere, not just in the
dungeon we explored.
Kirito
405900101_18_a
It looks like classic SAO monsters
are still spawning all over the
place.
Leafa
405900101_17_a
I've been gathering info on how
to beat SAO's floors.
Leafa
405900101_16_a
What's up, Leafa?
Kirito
405900101_15_a
Asuna
405900101_14_a
Hey guys!
Leafa
405900101_13_a
You've almost got the timing down,
Kirito.
Asuna
405900101_12_a
Asuna
405900101_11_a
It is. I just can't seem to pull
it off like Asuna does...
Kirito
405900101_10_a
This must be really tough if
Kirito's struggling with it!
Yuuki
405900101_9_a
Oops. Another failure.
Asuna
405900101_8_a
bg_10_field
AUGH!
Kirito

Yuuki

HRRRAAAH!

One step back...before
the big slash forward!
Kirito

Kirito
405900101_3_a
Got it!
Asuna
405900101_2_a
bg_10_field
Asuna! Switch!
Kirito
405900101_1_a
...
???
405801201_48_
But... It looked like...
Asuna
405801201_47_
Kirito
405801201_46_
Leafa
405801201_45_
Y-Yeah, I guess so.
Asuna
405801201_44_
Maybe you just imagined it?
Liz
405801201_43_
Sinon
405801201_42_
Silica
405801201_41_
Really? I didn't see anyone.
Yuuki
405801201_40_
I could've sworn I just saw
someone standing over there...
Asuna
405801201_39_
Something up, Asuna?
Kirito
405801201_38_
Huh?
Asuna
405801201_37_
Asuna
405801201_36_
...
???
405801201_35_
Kirito
405801201_34_
Leafa
405801201_33_
Yeah! Let's get back to playing!
Asuna
405801201_32_
Sinon
405801201_31_
Silica
405801201_30_
So anyway, let's get a move on!
I want to keep plowing through
this floor!
Yuuki
405801201_29_
Fine, I get it. I'll try to be a
better teacher. Sheesh.
Kirito
405801201_28_
Kirito
405801201_27_
Asuna
405801201_26_
Definitely. He's terrible. He just
goes on and on about "feeling
it." Not helpful.
Leafa
405801201_25_
Silica
405801201_24_
Sinon
405801201_23_
I'm pretty sure you'll be a way
better teacher than Kirito, too.
Liz
405801201_22_
Leafa
405801201_21_
Kirito
405801201_20_
Yeah, I can guarantee that.
Besides, I'll help you guys
with it as much as I can!
Asuna
405801201_19_
Silica
405801201_18_
Liz
405801201_17_
At least it's more realistic than
predicting bullet lines or any of
Kirito's other inhuman feats.
Sinon
405801201_16_
Hehehe... Theoretically, yeah.
Theoretically.
Asuna
405801201_15_
Kirito
405801201_14_
Asuna
405801201_13_
Yeah, that was beyond belief...
But seriously...can anyone besides
Asuna pull that off?
Leafa
405801201_12_
It was ridiculously powerful,
stronger than any other technique
I've ever seen!
Yuuki
405801201_11_
Yeah! I could feel the shockwave
all the way across the room!
Yuuki
405801201_10_
Sinon
405801201_9_
Silica
405801201_8_
Asuna! You just blew my mind!
Switching will never be the same!
Liz
405801201_7_
You were amazing, Asuna!!
Kirito
405801201_6_
I did it...
I DID IT!!

Asuna

All I have to do is wait for the
perfect moment, and...STRIKE!!
Asuna
405801101_43_
I can hear the creak of their
armor and feel the wind from their
blades... I can sense it all...
Asuna
405801101_42_
We know each other. VRMMO or not,
I can feel the way they breathe,
sense the beat of their hearts...
Asuna
405801101_41_
I can do this... Kirito, me, all
of us, we've fought side by side
for so long now.
Asuna
405801101_40_
Hraaaaaagh!!
Kirito

Nice parry, Asuna!

Hyaaa!!
Asuna

Asuna

We got more incoming!

405801101_26_
Sinon
405801101_25_
Graaargh!!
Monster
405801101_24_
Right! Asuna, I got your back!
Let's do this!
Kirito
405801101_23_
You two have the best chance of
pulling it off!
Leafa
405801101_22_
Kirito, partner up with her! You
guys have the best teamwork
out of all of us!
Leafa
405801101_21_
But let's give it our best shot!
Asuna
405801101_20_
R-Right! We still only manage to
get it right one out of every
five times...
Asuna
405801101_19_
Leafa
405801101_18_
Asuna
405801101_17_
Then it's time to test our new
technique! Asuna, let's do it!
Kirito
405801101_16_
Y-Yeah, the monsters here are too
tough for us to take out with our
normal strategy...
Yuuki
405801101_15_
I'll provide some support fire
too, but...
Sinon
405801101_14_
Chiiirp!
Pina
405801101_13_
Pina, back them up!

405801101_1_
Yeah! Let's get back to playing!
Asuna
405801001_32_
Ha ha, great! Let's get back to
it, then! Practice makes perfect!
Kirito
405801001_31_
So of course I'm excited about it!
Asuna
405801001_30_
Come to think of it, this might
be the first technique I've come
up with.
Asuna
405801001_29_
Hmm... Hehe, I guess you're right!
Asuna
405801001_28_
It always seemed like you were
having too much fun to bother.
Kirito
405801001_27_
On the other hand, you never
seemed to focus too much on
planning and strategy in ALO.
Kirito
405801001_26_
I guess that's true...
Asuna
405801001_25_
Yeah. Back in SAO, you didn't
smile that much when fighting. You
were always cool and collected.
Kirito
405801001_24_
Really?
Asuna
405801001_23_
Ha ha, it's just that I rarely
get to see you this excited about
working out a new strategy.
Kirito
405801001_22_
Hey, what are you laughing for?!
Asuna
405801001_21_
Ha ha ha.
Kirito
405801001_20_
Kirito, let's give it one more
shot!
Asuna
405801001_19_
Yeah, I think that'll help a lot!
Asuna
405801001_18_
Asuna...
Kirito
405801001_17_
Hmm... Let's try to spread our
attacks out a bit more, and focus
less on getting crits.
Asuna
405801001_16_
Yeah, but targeting the enemy's
weak spot makes the most sense
if we want to maximize damage.
Kirito
405801001_15_
Maybe the problem is that we're
both targeting the same spot?
Asuna
405801001_14_
Even using our most precise
attacks doesn't help that much.
Kirito
405801001_13_
Y-Yeah, I'm fine. But I guess
it really is hard not to get in
each other's way.
Asuna
405801001_12_
Asuna
405801001_11_
Are you okay, Asuna?
Kirito
405801001_10_
Silica
405801001_9_
Sinon
405801001_8_
Oof... Looks like you bumped into
each other again...
Leafa
405801001_7_
Ahhh!
Asuna
405801001_6_
Wha
Kirito
405801001_5_
A quick dodge back, and then...
Attack!!
Asuna
405801001_4_
On it!
Kirito
405801001_3_
Kirito
405801001_2_
bg_09_dungeon_safety
Kirito! Switch!
Asuna
405801001_1_
Yui
405800901_66_
Kirito
405800901_65_
Thanks, everyone!
Asuna
405800901_64_
Silica
405800901_63_
Yuuki
405800901_62_
Good idea.
Sinon
405800901_61_
Let's practice Asuna's technique
until we all get the hang of it!
Kirito
405800901_60_
I know we're all eager to keep
going, but I say we stop here
for a bit.
Kirito
405800901_59_
Yeah! Let's get back to playing!
Asuna
405800901_58_
So rather than focus on individual
skill, we're counting on teamwork
to get us through this. I'm game.
Kirito
405800901_57_
Asuna
405800901_56_
Yui
405800901_55_
Asuna's nothing if not thorough.
I'm sure she thought all of this
out before talking to us about it.
Kirito
405800901_54_
Silica
405800901_53_
Sinon
405800901_52_
Wow! I guess Asuna looked into
that ahead of time too, huh?
Planning, woo!
Yuuki
405800901_51_
But right now, there's a good
chance that Mommy's plan will
work.
Yui
405800901_50_
Kirito
405800901_49_
Asuna
405800901_48_
Yup! There's already talk of it
being fixed in the next patch.
Yui
405800901_47_
Silica
405800901_46_
Sinon
405800901_45_
Really?
Yuuki
405800901_44_
However, in the latest ALO update,
some people have noticed a shorter
delay after parrying.
Yui
405800901_43_
As Yuuki observed, the parrying
player will be frozen briefly
after their initial action.
Yui
405800901_42_
Oh, sure. By all means.
Asuna
405800901_41_
I hope you don't mind if I cut in
for a moment. I've been listening
to your conversation.
Yui
405800901_40_
Oh! Hi, Yui!
Asuna
405800901_39_
Yuuki?
Yui
405800901_38_
Kirito
405800901_37_
Leafa
405800901_36_
Well...
Asuna
405800901_35_
But will the parrying player
really be able to pull off a
second attack that soon?
Yuuki
405800901_34_
Of course, everyone's able to
switch out, and some people
recover quicker than others...
Yuuki
405800901_33_
Sinon
405800901_32_
Silica
405800901_31_
The monster's basically stunned
while it's recovering, but so is
the player who parried, right?
Yuuki
405800901_30_
Kirito
405800901_29_
Leafa
405800901_28_
Sure, shoot.
Asuna
405800901_27_
Sinon
405800901_26_

405800901_25_
Hey, can I offer up a small
observation?

Leafa
405800901_23_
Kirito
405800901_22_
Guys... Thanks...

Sinon
405800901_20_
Liz
405800901_19_
Y-Yeah! I'll give it a try too!
At the very least, it sounds
easier than Kirito's techniques!
Silica
405800901_18_
Still, if we practice hard,
I'm sure we'll all get the
hang of it.
Leafa

Kirito
405800901_16_
Asuna
405800901_15_
Count me in! Well, I say that,
but I get the feeling only Asuna
can make it work right now.
Leafa
405800901_14_
Yeah, it won't be easy, but it's
definitely worth a shot.
Sinon
405800901_13_
I just want to say that if Asuna's
the one who's got my back,
I think we can pull it off.
Liz
405800901_12_
The hardest part of the technique
she's thought up is working in
perfect unison with your partner.
Liz
405800901_11_
I have no doubt she's able to read
the battlefield better than anyone
else here.
Liz
405800901_10_
Silica
405800901_9_
Sinon
405800901_8_
Asuna's been an incredible

Kirito

Asuna
405800901_4_
Silica
405800901_3_
Sinon
405800901_2_
bg_12_bi_palace
But that doesn't mean we can't
try!
Liz
405800901_1_
I know it won't be easy...
Asuna
405800801_52_
Not only would they need insane
reflexes, but they'd need a keen
sense of their surroundings too.
Kirito
405800801_51_
But for someone to parry,
fall back, then immediately
leap forward and attack...
Kirito
405800801_50_
I'm not saying it's impossible.
The enemy's recovering, so
theoretically it should work.
Kirito
405800801_49_
The concept of switching was
invented to eliminate that risk.
Asuna
405800801_48_
I know. A lot of times, you just
get in each other's way.
Asuna
405800801_47_
but techniques like switching were
made because simultaneous attacks
can cause lots of problems.
Kirito
405800801_46_
Asuna, this is par for the course
with most games, so I'm sure you
know it already,
Kirito
405800801_45_
...
Kirito
405800801_44_
But if they could pull it off,
the damage multiplier would
be huge.
Asuna
405800801_43_
Yeah. The first person has to
cancel their action quick enough
to strike
and time it just right.
Asuna
405800801_42_
Kirito
405800801_41_
Asuna
405800801_40_
But isn't that putting a lot of
pressure on one person?
Leafa
405800801_39_
Liz
405800801_38_
Silica
405800801_37_
A simultaneous strike, huh?
Sinon
405800801_36_
If they move fast enough, they can
hit the enemy at the same time as
their partner.
Asuna
405800801_35_
Leafa
405800801_34_
Kirito
405800801_33_
Yeah, well... I started thinking...
What if the person who switches
out leaps back in?
Asuna
405800801_32_
Liz
405800801_31_
Sinon
405800801_30_
That's pretty much it!
It's basically a two-person
combo attack.
Silica
405800801_29_
another person darts in and hits
it with a sword skill. Right?
Asuna
405800801_28_
So to perform a switch, one person
parries, then while the monster is
recovering,
Asuna
405800801_27_
Leafa
405800801_26_
Kirito
405800801_25_
Anyway, it's kinda like an
advanced version of the switch.
Or a more efficient version?
Asuna
405800801_24_
Sinon
405800801_23_
Silica
405800801_22_
Ha ha, sorry, Asuna! Keep going.
Liz
405800801_21_
Leafa
405800801_20_
Kirito
405800801_19_
H-Hey, come on, Liz...
I don't even know if it's
possible yet...
Asuna
405800801_18_
Sinon
405800801_17_
Silica
405800801_16_
Oooh, gather 'round! Asuna's
about to blow our minds!

405800801_15_
Leafa
405800801_14_
Kirito
405800801_13_
Well, this is something I thought
up back during SAO...
Asuna
405800801_12_
Okay, I follow!
So, what's the plan?
Yuuki
405800801_9_
Sinon
405800801_11_
Silica
405800801_10_
At this rate, I don't think
switches alone will get us
through this.
Asuna
405800801_8_
But as you all pointed out,
the difficulty is only going
to ramp up from here.
Asuna
405800801_7_
I think our only chance to make it
through is to play like we did in
SAO and use switches.
Asuna
405800801_6_
If we're right, and this whole
area is running on the original
SAO's rules...
Asuna
405800801_5_
Yeah, what is it?
Kirito
405800801_4_
Leafa
405800801_3_

Hey, can I have a minute?
I have an idea.
Asuna
405800801_1_
...
Asuna
405800701_35_
Ahaha, I guess not, huh?
Leafa
405800701_34_
Oh come on! I can't just pull
these things out of a hat!
Kirito
405800701_33_
Asuna
405800701_32_
Kirito
405800701_31_
Yeah! Kirito, think of something!
Leafa
405800701_30_
Sinon

Silica
405800701_28_
So, someone want to come up with
a super powerful unique skill and
save the day? Anyone?

Leafa
405800701_26_
Asuna
405800701_25_
Yeah...
Kirito
405800701_24_
For sure. The monsters are sure to
get stronger the farther in we go.
Sinon
405800701_23_
That means we'll have to rely on
switching to get us through this
one. We'll have to be careful.
Yuuki
405800701_22_
Yeah, these monsters aren't here
by accident. They even set it so
we have to play like it was SAO.
Silica
405800701_21_
I think it's pretty obvious that
this blast-from-the-past was done
on purpose.
Liz
405800701_20_
Sinon
405800701_19_
Silica
405800701_18_
Yeah, I'm with you there.
It's like a retro SAO monster
party down here.
Liz
405800701_17_
I don't think that was the last
SAO mob we'll see on this floor.
The place is crawling with them.

I've got a plan, people! Follow
my orders, and we'll make it

Asuna
405800601_58_
We can use switches to maximize
our damage output!
Kirito
405800601_57_
Good thinking, Asuna! Without
magic, our options are limited.
Kirito
405800601_56_
Everyone, listen up! Focus
on switching! It's our most
effective weapon now!

Yuuki
405800601_33_
Sinon
405800601_32_
Yuuki
405800601_31_
So in other words, our sword
skills and your Skill Connect are
going to be a lot weaker!
Silica
405800601_30_
That means we're not going to get
any of those magical buffs...
Kirito
405800601_29_
Worse, normally sword skills in
ALO are enhanced by magic.
But we can't use magic here.
Kirito
405800601_28_
Leafa
405800601_27_
Asuna
405800601_26_
N-No, Liz. My Skill Connect has
nothing to do with ALO. It's just
timing and talent.
Kirito
405800601_25_
The Black Swordsman over here
can use his Skill Connect. Thus,
still ALO!

No flight, no magic...
It's just like SAO.

No way! There are a lot of places

Waaah! Mine isn't working either!

No, she's right! Something's
wrong! My magic isn't working!
Asuna
405800601_11_
You mean the fact that we can't
fly because there's no sunlight?
Kirito

Wait! There's something weird

lead a huge guild
the KoB.

Ahahaha, no I didn't!
Just your imagination!
Leafa
405800501_43_
Hey, Sugu. You just basically
called me a crazy idiot.
Kirito
405800501_42_
Asuna
405800501_41_
Kirito
405800501_40_
Yeah. I shudder at the thought

405800501_37_
Yeah, I'm with you there. We're a
party. We all have our roles and

But I don't think everyone needs
to emulate his style of fighting.
Asuna

405800501_30_
Huh? What do you mean?

But his Skill Connect and
Spellcutter Strike don't really
fit me...
Asuna

be nice to have some cool moves
like he does.

Yeah, don't forget half of them
are Kirito-only uber moves,
like your Skill Connect.
Liz
405800501_14_
I guess so. We have a lot more
options now, and can use them
to pull off unreal stunts.
Kirito
405800501_13_
So in other words, this is proof
that ALO does a lot more to
empower players than SAO did.
Leafa
405800501_12_
Even with that many people, it was
a close thing. It's a miracle we
beat it with a party this size.
Kirito
405800501_11_
You know, I fought that thing in

whole raid party to take it down.

405800401_10_
Flight and magic, obviously,
but they've even added sword
skills and OSSs recently too!
Leafa
405800401_9_
But hey! This is ALO, right?
There's all sorts of cool powers
we have besides sword skills!
Leafa
405800401_8_
I didn't know that...
Kirito
405800401_7_
But after a lot of looking,
I couldn't find anything that
might compare to the Divine Blade.
Asuna
405800401_6_
I was determined to learn one that
could be a game-changer.
Asuna
405800401_5_
Y-Yeah... After that, I went to
an info broker to learn everything
I could about extra skills.
Asuna
405800401_4_
Leafa
405800401_3_
Asuna
405800401_2_
bg_10_field
Kayaba said that, huh?
Kirito
405800401_1_
That's a good point. Thank you
for the advice, Commander.
Asuna
405800301_27_
Asking someone to teach you how
to master it would be the shortest
route to greater power.
Heathcliff 
405800301_26_
I would recommend that you search
for an extra skill that suits you.
Heathcliff 
405800301_25_
Exactly. So if you truly wish to
grow stronger...
Heathcliff 
405800301_24_
The only difference is that we
know how to gain extra skills,
but not unique skills. Right?
Asuna
405800301_23_
However, I don't believe extra
skills are stronger than unique
skills, or vice versa.
Heathcliff 
405800301_22_
Many of them are much more
powerful than your average
sword skill.
Heathcliff 
405800301_21_
Correct. Extra skills like katana
mastery can only be earned through
experience and hard work.
Heathcliff 
405800301_20_
Are you talking about extra
skills?
Asuna
405800301_19_
Unique skills are powerful.
But remember: they are not the
only path to strength, Asuna.
Heathcliff 
405800301_18_
I cannot deny that my Divine Blade
is one of the few unique skills
that exist in SAO.
Heathcliff 
405800301_17_
I guess you're right...
Asuna
405800301_16_
Ah, I see. You wish to become
stronger to protect your comrades
and conquer Aincrad. Correct?
Heathcliff 
405800301_15_
would make a huge difference
against tough enemies like those
we faced today.
Asuna
405800301_14_
I was just thinking that having
an ace up my sleeve, like your
Divine Blade,
Asuna
405800301_13_
Why do you ask that?
Heathcliff 
405800301_12_
Do you think I'll ever be able to
learn a unique skill like you,
Commander?
Asuna
405800301_11_
Yes?
Heathcliff 
405800301_10_
Well... It's nothing, it's just...
Asuna
405800301_9_
You don't sound very happy.
What's wrong?
Heathcliff 
405800301_8_
I guess you're right...
Asuna
405800301_7_
Ha ha, think nothing of it.
We're the Knights of the Blood
Oath. We look after our own.
Heathcliff 
405800301_6_
If your Divine Blade hadn't been
there today to bail us out...
Asuna
405800301_5_
No, we owe our victory to you.
Your party held off that wave of
reinforcements that spawned.
Asuna
405800301_4_
That we did. Good work out there
today, Asuna. Your quick thinking
saved the lot of us.
Heathcliff 
405800301_3_
Heathcliff 
405800301_2_
bg_08_dungeon_normal
Looks like we made it back in one
piece, Commander.
Asuna
405800301_1_
You know, a long time ago, I had
a very similar conversation with
the commander
with Heathcliff.
Asuna
405800201_34_
Asuna...
Kirito
405800201_33_
Leafa
405800201_32_
Kirito
405800201_31_
This conversation's bringing back
all sorts of memories...
Asuna
405800201_30_
That's right...
Silica
405800201_29_
Or rather, they were our only
hope for survival.
Liz
405800201_28_
Sword skills were everything to
us in SAO. They were our ultimate
techniques...
Liz
405800201_27_
Sinon
405800201_26_
Silica
405800201_25_
That pretty much sums it up.
ALO's got sword skills now too,
but it's not the same.
Liz
405800201_24_
You also had to be able to stay
cool in the face of death and
know how to work as a team.
Kirito
405800201_23_
Yeah. Sword skill proficiency was
critical to get on the Assault
Team. General gaming skills too.
Kirito
405800201_22_
That's why sword skills were so
important to us. We didn't have
many other tools to work with.
Asuna
405800201_21_
Leafa
405800201_20_
Asuna
405800201_19_
Not really. We had a few, like
chakrams and boomerangs,
but swords were the standard.
Kirito
405800201_18_
Silica
405800201_17_
Liz
405800201_16_
There weren't many ranged weapons
either, right?
Sinon
405800201_15_
Asuna
405800201_14_
Kirito
405800201_13_
Wow, I guess ALO abilities really
do make a big difference. Combat
in SAO must've been real tough.
Leafa
405800201_12_
Yeah, they do seem much easier
than before.
Silica
405800201_11_
We couldn't do that back in SAO.
Plus, we have magic now!
Magic makes everything easier!
Liz
405800201_10_
Sinon
405800201_9_
Silica
405800201_8_
Well, at least we can fly.
We can get in their blind spots
and whack 'em good.
Liz
405800201_7_
Leafa
405800201_6_
Kirito
405800201_5_
Yeah...
Asuna
405800201_4_
Sinon
405800201_3_
Silica
405800201_2_
bg_10_field
This area is seriously swarming
with original SAO monsters...
Liz
405800201_1_
Leafa
405800101_52_
Asuna
405800101_51_
...
Kirito
405800101_50_
It would be reasonable to assume
they're just reusing old game
resources.
Sinon
405800101_49_
Relax, people. It's a Seed world,
and it is Aincrad
new or not.
Sinon
405800101_48_
Supposedly! But then why are we
seeing monsters from the original
SAO here?!
Yuuki
405800101_47_
I thought all the monsters in this
version of Aincrad were brand-new!
Silica
405800101_46_
Sinon
405800101_45_
Silica
405800101_44_
Wait, really?!
What's it doing here?!
Liz
405800101_43_
Yeah, it's a Frenzy Boar!
It's from the original SAO!
Asuna
405800101_42_
Hey! I've seen this thing before!
Kirito
405800101_41_
Leafa
405800101_40_
Asuna
405800101_39_
Kirito
405800101_38_
bg_event_dungeon_sao
Graaawr!!
Monster
405800101_37_
Roger that.
Kirito
405800101_36_
Let's get moving already.
We can strategize on the way.
Asuna
405800101_35_
Leafa
405800101_34_
Asuna
405800101_33_
Good points all around. We should
come up with a solid strategy for
our current party makeup.
Kirito
405800101_32_
My sniping tends to draw a lot of
aggro, so I should be able to throw
the enemy into utter disorder.
Sinon
405800101_31_
Without a solid tank, we should
focus on maxing our DPS to take
baddies out quick.
Silica
405800101_30_
Sinon
405800101_29_
Silica
405800101_28_
I messaged the other Sleeping
Knights, but none of them can
make it either.
Yuuki
405800101_27_
Asuna
405800101_26_
Kirito
405800101_25_
Ouch, losing Agil's tanking and
Klein's DPS will hurt.
Leafa
405800101_24_
Silica
405800101_23_
Sinon
405800101_22_
Hehe, that is true. By the way,
it looks like Klein and Agil
aren't joining us today, huh?
Liz
405800101_21_
Leafa
405800101_20_
Asuna
405800101_19_
Liz, that sort of overconfidence
will get you killed. The devs have
been cranking up the difficulty.
Kirito
405800101_18_
We've got our ALO magic now, not
to mention we can FLY! This'll be
a cakewalk.
Liz
405800101_17_
Sinon
405800101_16_
Silica
405800101_15_
Hehe, stop brandishing your
bloodlust, guys. You don't have
to get that excited about this.
Liz
405800101_14_
It's time we got back to clearing
Aincrad!
Asuna
405800101_13_
You bet we are! We've been getting
too sidetracked with all those fun
event quests lately.
Asuna
405800101_12_
bg_11_starting_city
Alright! Aincrad, here we come!
We're going to focus on beating
you for good this time!
Kirito
405800101_9_
Leafa
405800101_11_
Asuna
405800101_10_
Very well, I'll bite. I am curious
to see what sort of lives they're
living now, after all.
???
405800101_8_
A security hole that's simply
begging to be exploited. An
invitation, or a trap?
???
405800101_7_
Oh.
???
405800101_6_
The world they are in now appears
to be one of fairies and magic.
???
405800101_5_
...What's this?
???
405800101_4_
To think the Seed Nexus would
grow so large, so fast. So many
possibilities...
???
405800101_3_
Hmm...
Fascinating.
???
405800101_2_
bg_black
...
???
405800101_1_
Asuna, not you too!
I'm coming! Wait for me!!
Sinon
405701201_44_a
Yeah, Sinonon! Enjoy the view...
From last place!
Asuna
405701201_43_a
It's been ages since we flew...
Why not go slow and enjoy it?
Sinon
405701201_42_a
sigh
... I know you're excited
to have your wings back,
but take it down a notch...
Sinon
405701201_41_a
Just try and beat me!
Yuuki
405701201_40_a
Yuuki
405701201_39_a
Sinon

Arrrgh! Wait up, you big jerk!
Leafa

Three-two-one-GO!
Kirito
405701201_36_a

Last one there's a rotten egg!

Leafa
405701201_33_a

Guys, I've spotted Alfheim!
Sinon
405701201_31_a
Leafa
405701201_30_a
Sinon
405701201_29_a
Yeah!
Yuuki
405701201_28_a
I'd love to go back and visit them
sometime.
Kirito
405701201_27_a
Asuna
405701201_26_a
Yeah! It just goes to show that
even pirates have their own sort
of honor... They were a good crew.
Kirito
405701201_25_a
Sinon
405701201_24_a
Yuuki
405701201_23_a
I didn't know how I'd cope without
my wings at first, but I ended up
having a great time!
Leafa
405701201_22_a
Kirito
405701201_21_a
Haha, yeah! We got to do all kinds
of things we'd never get the
chance to in Alfheim!
Asuna
405701201_20_a
Leafa
405701201_19_a
Sinon
405701201_18_a
That. Was. AWESOME!!

Finally, we're almost back.
Sinon
405701201_14_a
Thank you all!
Remember not to pick up any more
suspicious shiphikers!
Kirito
405701201_13_a
So long, fairies! Don't forget
the salt and the sea!
Captain
405701201_12_a
Aye-aye, cap'n!
Crew Members
405701201_11_a
We've moved all the
loot aboard. Time to set sail!
Captain
405701201_10_a
And it was fun while it lasted.
Kirito
405701201_9_a
But it's thanks to you that we got
rid of that spy and got our hands
on the treasure!
Captain
405701201_8_a
Sorry, cap'n.
Kirito
405701201_7_a
So I guess this is goodbye
and
just when you landlubbers were
starting to show real promise...
Captain
405701201_6_a
Ha ha!
I'm sorry we kept it from you.
Kirito
405701201_5_a
So the legends were true!
Captain
405701201_4_a
Kirito
405701201_3_a
Asuna
405701201_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
I had a hunch there was something
different about you guys...
Captain
405701201_1_a
Yuuki
405701101_23_a
Leafa
405701101_22_a
Ahh, of course. The "artifact" on
this island was the key to
changing us back.
Sinon
405701101_21_a
Our wings!
They grew back?!
Kirito
405701101_20_a
Kirito
405701101_19_a
What's wrong, Leafa?
Wait...AHH! Guys, look!
Asuna
405701101_18_a
Sinon
405701101_17_a
Yuuki
405701101_16_a
Wow... It looks magical!
...Eeep!
Leafa
405701101_15_a
Asuna
405701101_14_a
It's a bas-relief...
Of winged fairies!
Kirito
405701101_13_a
Leafa
405701101_12_a
Sinon
405701101_11_a
Hey, guys! What's this thing
on the wall for?
Yuuki
405701101_10_a
We did it! We routed the enemy,
got tons of treasure, and got out
of there in one
Leafa
405701101_9_a
Yuuki
405701101_8_a
Leafa
405701101_7_a
Guys, follow me! I found a pathway
that'll get us out of here!
Sinon
405701101_6_a
You can practically hear
the "cha-ching!" noises!
Asuna
405701101_5_a
Whoa...
There's so much gold!
It's just like in the movies!
Kirito
405701101_4_a
Kirito
405701101_3_a
Asuna
405701101_2_a
bg_event_remains
Hooo-eee!
Now that's a treasure hoard!
Crew
405701101_1_a
There is?! Awesome!
Kirito
405701001_81_a
Asuna
405701001_80_a
Kirito
405701001_79_a
There's a hidden passageway here,
built into the wall!
Captain
405701001_78_a
Sinon
405701001_77_a
Yuuki
405701001_76_a
Isn't this path a dead end?
Leafa
405701001_75_a
Where are we going?
Kirito
405701001_74_a
Everyone! Follow me!!
I've got a trick up my sleeve,
and I intend to use it!
Captain
405701001_73_a
It was too risky to say when I
feared we had a spy, but with that
rat-fink gone...
Captain
405701001_72_a
And sure enough it wasn't one of
my own! I can still trust my crew!
Captain
405701001_71_a
Captain...
Kirito
405701001_70_a
But what kind of a captain
would doubt his own men?
Captain
405701001_69_a
You did?
Kirito
405701001_68_a
If you wanna know the truth of it,
part of me figured we had a spy
aboard.
Captain
405701001_67_a
Well, that's only if we manage to
make it out of this pickle with
our skins intact...
Kirito
405701001_66_a
At least we don't have to worry
about these guys ambushing
us again.
Captain
405701001_65_a
Captain
405701001_64_a
Haha! That's one way to look at
it. Well, the spy's been dealt
with, but we're still in trouble.
Kirito
405701001_63_a
Leafa
405701001_62_a
Sinon
405701001_61_a
And got the drop on us with a
parrot! That is the most pirate-y
pirate that ever pirated!
Yuuki
405701001_60_a
Leafa
405701001_59_a
Yuuki
405701001_58_a
So an enemy disguised himself
knowing we'd pick him up from
that desert island...
Sinon
405701001_57_a
Let him go!
Chasing him won't change anything!
Captain
405701001_56_a
Captain
405701001_55_a
Kirito
405701001_54_a
Captain!
Should we follow him?!
Crew
405701001_53_a
Hey! He's getting away!
Asuna
405701001_52_a
Captain
405701001_51_a
Kirito
405701001_50_a
Bah! I've been foiled!
Castaway
405701001_49_a
he let Squawkers there loose to
carry the message to his
heavily-armed buddies.
Kirito
405701001_48_a
He must've trained his parrot real
well. Once he figured out where
we were headed,
Kirito
405701001_47_a
...
Castaway
405701001_46_a
He used the PARROT!
Kirito
405701001_45_a
If he's been aboard the whole
time, how'd he tell the enemies
about our movements?
Captain
405701001_44_a
Captain
405701001_43_a
Yeah, I know.
That's what I'm doing.
Kirito
405701001_42_a
Yuuki
405701001_41_a
Sinon
405701001_40_a
His AI is pretty basic.
You probably need to use simpler
words...
Leafa
405701001_39_a
Leafa
405701001_38_a
Yuuki
405701001_37_a
But Kirito, are you sure that's
going to make sense to an NPC
like the captain?
Sinon
405701001_36_a
Huh...
The timing does work out.
Asuna
405701001_35_a
Captain
405701001_34_a
The ambushes only started after
we let this guy on board.
Kirito
405701001_33_a
The CASTAWAY is a SPY?
What proof have you?
Captain
405701001_32_a
...
Castaway
405701001_31_a
Captain
405701001_30_a
Him!
That so-called CASTAWAY is a SPY!
Kirito
405701001_29_a
Leafa
405701001_28_a
Sinon
405701001_27_a
Kirito? What's going on?!
Yuuki
405701001_26_a
What?!
A SPY? In my crew?!
Captain
405701001_25_a
There's a SPY aboard this SHIP.
Kirito
405701001_24_a
What ho, sharkbait?
Captain
405701001_23_a
Captain
405701001_22_a
Captain!
Kirito
405701001_21_a
Asuna
405701001_20_a
Well, more or less...
Kirito
405701001_19_a
Leafa
405701001_18_a
Sinon
405701001_17_a
Say what?!
Did you figure it out?!
Yuuki
405701001_16_a
Well, I thought I'd tell our
pirate buddies how the enemy has
been tracking us.
Kirito
405701001_15_a
Kirito...?
What are you planning?
Asuna
405701001_14_a
Alright! I think it's about time
for us to get a bit dramatic.
Kirito
405701001_13_a
Asuna
405701001_12_a
...
Kirito
405701001_11_a
Yuuki
405701001_9_a
It's like they're using a tracing
searcher spell, but I don't think
humans can cast fairy spells...
Leafa
405701001_8_a
Sinon
405701001_10_a
Sooner or later, there won't
be a "next time."
Sinon
405701001_7_a
Yuuki
405701001_6_a
Leafa
405701001_5_a
No matter where we run,
they're always a step ahead of us.
Sinon
405701001_4_a
How do they keep working out
our position?!
Captain
405701001_3_a
Look at how many there are...
I think they mean to finish us off
once and for all.
Crew
405701001_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_sao
Bilgerats! They've got us totally
surrounded!
Captain
405701001_1_a
Wait... That's it!
Kirito
405700901_54_a
Aaand there goes our resident
mystery man, slinking off again...
Asuna
405700901_53_a
...
Castaway
405700901_52_a
You...
Kirito
405700901_51_a
Asuna
405700901_50_a
Kirito
405700901_49_a
...
Castaway
405700901_48_a
Oh no!
Not this again!
Captain
405700901_47_a
Asuna
405700901_46_a
What?!
Kirito
405700901_45_a
Captain
405700901_44_a
Captain, emergency!
We're under attack!
Crew
405700901_43_a
Asuna

Kirito
405700901_41_a
Yuuki
405700901_40_a
Leafa
405700901_39_a
That's the castaway's parrot,
isn't it? I guess he gives the
little guy room to roam.
Sinon
405700901_38_a
Yuuki
405700901_37_a
Sinon
405700901_36_a
There's that creepy bird again...
Leafa
405700901_35_a
Asuna
405700901_34_a
What's up, Sugu?
Kirito
405700901_33_a
Yuuki
405700901_32_a
Sinon
405700901_31_a
Hmm...
Leafa
405700901_30_a
Yuuki
405700901_29_a
Sinon
405700901_28_a
That'll be nice...
Aaah, I can't wait to feel the
breeze under my wings again!
Leafa
405700901_27_a
Yeah!
Asuna
405700901_26_a
This quest probably ends when we
make landfall, so it won't be long
now!
Kirito
405700901_25_a
Asuna
405700901_24_a
According to this map, we're not
all that far from Alfheim now.
Kirito
405700901_23_a
Yuuki
405700901_22_a
Sinon
405700901_21_a
Yeah... I miss flying.
It feels like ages since the last
time we hit the sky.
Leafa
405700901_20_a
I'm enjoying it more than I
expected, too. But isn't anyone
else yearning for their wings?
Sinon
405700901_19_a
Every day's a new adventure!
Yuuki
405700901_18_a
Sinon
405700901_17_a
Leafa
405700901_16_a
I know, right! Getting to do all
this pirate stuff is like a dream
come true!
Yuuki
405700901_15_a
The crew's kinda rowdy, but nice
when you get to know them.
I'm starting to like it here!
Kirito
405700901_14_a
It took a while, but I'm getting
used to the pirate life.
Kirito
405700901_13_a
Haha! You're finally finding your
sea legs, Kirito!
Asuna
405700901_12_a
Captain
405700901_11_a
Aye-aye, cap'n!
Kirito
405700901_10_a
I got high hopes for you newbies!
You better come back with some
good loot!
Captain
405700901_9_a
Mysterious magic artifact, huh?
Kirito
405700901_8_a
You know it! And enchanted booty
is the quickest way to make bank!
Har har har!!
Captain
405700901_7_a
Ain't there s'posed to be a
mysterious magic artifact on this
island too, Cap?
Crew
405700901_6_a
There's supposed to be a hoard
the size of a mountain buried
somewhere here.
Captain
405700901_5_a
We've got one job on this island:
find treasure!
Captain
405700901_4_a
Asuna

Ready, men!
Prepare to cast anchor!

Yeah. That's the castaway
we picked up...
Leafa
405700801_35_a
Kirito
405700801_34_a
Sinon
405700801_33_a
Who is he?
Another sailor?
Asuna

Asuna
405700801_31_a
Kirito
405700801_30_a
What's with that guy?
Yuuki apologized for bumping him,
but he didn't even react.
Sinon
405700801_29_a
...
???
405700801_28_a
Ouch! Oops...
S-Sorry about that, mister...
Yuuki

Oof!

Yeah!

Asuna
405700801_19_a
S-Sir, yes, sir!
All right, guys, let's roll!
Kirito
405700801_18_a
Hey you! Newbies!
Quit gawking and get ready
to defend the ship!
Captain
405700801_17_a
Sinon
405700801_16_a
Asuna
405700801_15_a
Maybe...
Kirito
405700801_14_a
Yuuki
405700801_13_a
That's the pirate's life, I guess.
They must spend a lot of time
stealing treasure back and forth.
Leafa
405700801_12_a
Seriously?
That's like, fifty times now...
Asuna
405700801_9_a
Kirito
405700801_11_a
Sinon
405700801_10_a
It sounds like those rival pirates
the good cap'n told us about
ambushed us again.
Kirito
405700801_8_a
Asuna
405700801_7_a
What's going on?
Sinon
405700801_6_a
Bah! They must be guessing where
we're headed somehow!
Captain
405700801_5_a
Again?! No matter where we go,
they hound us! How do they keep
finding us?!
Captain
405700801_4_a
Kirito
405700801_3_a
Captain
405700801_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
Captain, emergency!
We've been ambushed!
It's them!
Crew
405700801_1_a
Err, it's nothing.
Just thought the parrot was
a bit on the nose...
Kirito
405700701_45_a
Kirito
405700701_44_a
What's wrong, Kirito?
Asuna
405700701_43_a
Yuuki
405700701_42_a
Sinon
405700701_41_a
Well, just one human...
But he's got a pet parrot!
Leafa
405700701_40_a
Asuna
405700701_39_a
Hmm, cool. Just one castaway?
Kirito
405700701_38_a
Yuuki
405700701_37_a
Sinon
405700701_36_a
The captain is letting him stay
on board until they reach port.
Leafa
405700701_35_a
Yuuki
405700701_34_a
Sinon
405700701_33_a
Turns out they saved the castaway
just in time.
Leafa
405700701_32_a

Kirito
405700701_31_a
Kirito
405700701_30_a
Yeah, for sure!
Asuna
405700701_29_a
Sinon
405700701_28_a
Leafa
405700701_27_a
Heheh! The captain's a pretty
nice guy after all.
Yuuki
405700701_26_a
Aye-aye!
Crew
405700701_25_a
They must be a castaway!
We gotta help 'em!
Captain

Someone's collapsed over there!

You were right, Sinonon!
Your eyes are amazing!

I bet that's your Cait Sith
eyesight kicking in, Sinon.
Leafa

Asuna

Huh? I can't see anything...
Kirito
405700701_10_a
Leafa
405700701_9_a
Yuuki
405700701_8_a
Uh, hey...guys?
Why's there a little boat beached
on that sandbar?
Sinon
405700701_7_a
Right, men!
Prepare for landing!
Captain
405700701_6_a
Wow... Amazing!
Those islands look like the ruins
of an ancient civilization!

Land ho! Islands off the port bow!

They're demons who attack
innocents without mercy!
You won't soon forget 'em!
Captain
405700601_30_a
The blood-thirstiest sea dogs
this side of the blue!
Captain
405700601_29_a
We are? How bad are these pirates?
Kirito
405700601_28_a
We're headed straight into
enemy pirate territory.
Captain
405700601_27_a
Huh? What do you mean?
Kirito
405700601_26_a
But the next battle won't
be such a cakewalk.
Captain
405700601_25_a
Th-Thank you very much!
Kirito
405700601_24_a
Asuna

You guys weren't half-bad!
Beginner's luck, huh?
Captain

Yuuki
405700601_20_a
Sinon
405700601_19_a
Yeah! A little rough around the
edges, but definitely not
cold-blooded killers.
Leafa
405700601_18_a
at least the pirates are
chaotic-good.
Sinon
405700601_17_a
Leafa
405700601_16_a
Yuuki
405700601_15_a
Heheh! Agreed. If we absolutely
have to join a pirate crew for
this event,
Sinon
405700601_14_a
Asuna
405700601_13_a
Aye
er, I mean, yes, sir.
I guess there's more to these
pirates than meets the eye...
Kirito

AYE-AYE, CAP'N!!
Yuuki

Grab what booty you can,

Leafa
405700501_37_a
Sinon
405700501_36_a
Let's help them, Kirito!
I want to put a stop to those
evil nobles too!
Yuuki
405700501_35_a
Yeah, I stand corrected!
Kirito
405700501_34_a
Kirito! These guys aren't thieves:
they're heroes!
Asuna
405700501_33_a
You still wanna let 'em get away?
Captain
405700501_32_a
They're slavers?!
And they kidnap kids?!
Kirito
405700501_31_a
We're just taking back
what's ours. It's what's right!
Captain
405700501_30_a
And if that ain't bad enough,
some of 'em even steal kids for
the slave trade!
Captain
405700501_29_a
That ship's full of the nobles
that have starved and oppressed
the people for generations.
Captain
405700501_28_a
Lemme fill you in.
Captain
405700501_27_a
Urk, busted...
Uh... I mean, no, sir!
Kirito
405700501_26_a
Don't tell me you're trying your
hand at mutiny on your first day?
Captain
405700501_25_a
Hey, you!
You look rebellious!
Captain
405700501_24_a

Look alive, sharkbait!
I said, take arms!
Captain
405700501_21_a

Even if it's part of the script,
I don't want to hurt anyone...

Yuuki

I told you!
They're going to plunder it!
Sinon
405700501_13_a

405700501_12_a
Erm... Do we?
Kirito
405700501_11_a
ARRRRRRRRR!!

Captain

Ship sighted sou'-sou'-west !
And you know what that means!
Captain
405700501_8_a
Kirito
405700501_7_a
It must be some kind of meeting?
Asuna
405700501_6_a

What's all this about?
Kirito

Aye-aye, cap'n!

On deck, you lily-livered
muck-snipes! Assemble!
Captain
405700501_1_a
Kirito
405700401_49_a
That's a good point.
Now I'm getting worried...
Asuna
405700401_48_a
Yuuki
405700401_47_a
Leafa
405700401_46_a
sigh
I guess...
Let's just hope they don't get us
mixed up in their dirty deeds.
Sinon
405700401_45_a
Asuna
405700401_44_a
Either way, if we want to get home
our only choice is to keep
following the script.
Kirito
405700401_43_a
Sinon
405700401_42_a
Yuuki
405700401_41_a
Heheh, well, that's one way
of looking at it... But I'm sure
there are some nice ones!
Leafa
405700401_40_a
You know...bad guys? I'm not
sure joining this crew was
such a good idea.
Sinon
405700401_39_a
Well, they're pirates. Scoundrels.
The scum of the sea.
Sinon
405700401_38_a
I'm no neat freak, but I've never
seen anyone as messy as these
guys!
Yuuki
405700401_37_a
Yeah... I bet these guys haven't
even heard of the word "hygiene."
Or bathing, either. Yuck.
Yuuki
405700401_36_a
Seafaring bandits aren't exactly
known for their excellent hygiene.
Leafa
405700401_35_a
I took a look for myself and it
was even filthier than out here.
Sinon
405700401_34_a
Leafa
405700401_33_a
Yuuki
405700401_32_a
That just leaves tidying the
inside of the ship.
Unfortunately...
Sinon
405700401_31_a
Kirito
405700401_30_a
Phew! Now that's
one swabbed deck.
Asuna
405700401_29_a
Sinon
405700401_28_a
Yuuki
405700401_27_a
This must be the "tight ship"
he was talking about.
Leafa
405700401_26_a
Sinon
405700401_25_a
Leafa
405700401_24_a
Aww! Seriously?
Yuuki

Denied!!
Grab a mop and get to work!
Captain

Sinon
405700401_21_a
Leafa
405700401_20_a
Cap'n! Permission to steer
the ship, sir!
Yuuki
405700401_19_a
Asuna
405700401_18_a
You've got to start somewhere.
Kirito
405700401_17_a
Leafa

Yuuki
405700401_15_a
So we're stuck doing chores?
Sinon
405700401_14_a
Kirito
405700401_13_a
Phew... I was worried about
getting chewed out...
Asuna
405700401_12_a
You're new, so start off
by swabbing the decks.
Captain
405700401_11_a
Eep... Yes, Mr. Captain, sir!
Asuna
405700401_9_a
Kirito

Hey you! Sharkbait!
Get to work!

405700301_40_a
Leafa
405700301_39_a
For sure! I wanna find treasure
and have wild adventures like
the pirates on TV!
Yuuki
405700301_38_a
Yui
405700301_37_a
Kirito
405700301_36_a
Haha! You're really getting
into this, Yuuki.
Asuna
405700301_35_a
Yeah! It'd be a cinch if we
could fly, but this way we get
to live like real pirates!
Yuuki
405700301_34_a
Sinon
405700301_33_a
Yuuki
405700301_32_a
It all makes sense now!
That was the event theme
all along
pirates!
Leafa
405700301_31_a
That forces you to start the
event's main quest by joining up
with a band of scurvy sea dogs.
Kirito
405700301_30_a
Yui
405700301_29_a
Asuna
405700301_28_a
Yeah. Without wings, there's
no way to get home other
than navigate the seas.
Kirito
405700301_27_a
Sinon
405700301_26_a
Yuuki
405700301_25_a
I think I get it now...
This must be why the event
was set up so far away!
Leafa
405700301_24_a
Kirito
405700301_23_a
Yui
405700301_22_a
I-It's okay, Sinonon...
Just think of it as role-playing?
This is an RPG, after all...
Asuna
405700301_21_a
Leafa
405700301_20_a
Yuuki
405700301_19_a
Yeah, but that doesn't mean we
have to become a bunch of lousy
sea bandits...
Sinon
405700301_18_a
so we need to earn our keep along
the way by helping the NPCs.
Kirito
405700301_17_a
Yui
405700301_16_a
Asuna
405700301_15_a
It's our only shot!
Nobody said this would be a
luxury cruise ship,
Kirito
405700301_14_a
When is becoming a pirate
EVER a good idea?!
Sinon
405700301_13_a
Yuuki
405700301_12_a
Leafa
405700301_11_a
Hold up, Kirito!
Are you sure this is the best
way get back home?
Sinon
405700301_10_a
Yui
405700301_9_a_2
Asuna
405700301_9_a_1
Aye-aye, captain!
Kirito
405700301_9_a
But get ready to work!
I run a tight ship!
Captain
405700301_8_a
Especially since the last young
blood that signed on ended up
all over the foredeck! Har har!
Captain
405700301_7_a
Why not! We could use
some young blood!
Captain
405700301_6_a
Yui
405700301_5_a
Asuna
405700301_4_a
Y-Yeah, we want to be pirates...?
Kirito
405700301_3_a
Heh heh! You don't know what
you're getting yourselves into...
Captain
405700301_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
No fooling? You guys seriously
wanna join MY crew?!
Captain
405700301_1_a
Tell us more!
Kirito
405700201_32_a
to go looking for treasure in
that fairy-land of yours.
Harbor Town NPC
405700201_31_a
I hear they got it into their
crazy heads...
Harbor Town NPC
405700201_30_a
Pirates?!
Kirito
405700201_29_a
Ya didn't hear it from me, but
we got some pirates docked
in this harbor!
Harbor Town NPC
405700201_28_a
Yeah?
Kirito
405700201_27_a
Ah! Now that you mention it...
Harbor Town NPC
405700201_26_a
Yeah...
Asuna
405700201_25_a
Still, they always end up having
something to do with gods and
myths...
Kirito
405700201_24_a
ALO events are usually fantasy
takes on a seasonal theme, even if
they are sometimes a bit forced.
Kirito
405700201_23_a
...
Kirito
405700201_22_a
Correct. It only said that we
needed to fly here.
Yui
405700201_21_a
Kirito
405700201_20_a
Yui
405700201_19_a
Now you mention it, this time
the event information was
really unclear.
Asuna
405700201_18_a
I still haven't worked out the
theme of this event...
Leafa
405700201_17_a
There's gotta be a reason for
that... But what?
Leafa
405700201_16_a
I'm pretty sure the NPCs
are programmed to give
that as a stock response.
Leafa
405700201_15_a
What's up, Leafa?
Yuuki
405700201_14_a
Sinon
405700201_13_a
Yuuki
405700201_12_a
Yeah... But still...
Leafa
405700201_11_a
The humans here don't know
about Alfheim, so they think
we're talking about myths.
Asuna
405700201_10_a
I see...
So we're out of luck.
Kirito
405700201_9_a
But there ain't a captain alive
fool enough to try to take
you 'cross the ocean.
Harbor Town NPC
405700201_8_a
Welp, if it's boats you want,
you're in the right place...
Harbor Town NPC
405700201_7_a
Ah, haha...
Right...
Kirito
405700201_6_a
That's nothin' but a myth!
You guys are pretty kooky!
Harbor Town NPC
405700201_5_a
Yui
405700201_4_a
Asuna
405700201_3_a
Kirito
405700201_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
So lemme get this straight...
You wanna get to a fairy-land
far across the sea?
Harbor Town NPC
405700201_1_a
Hey there!
You guys all right?
Harbor Town NPC
405700101_47_a
No way...
Asuna
405700101_46_a
Yui
405700101_45_a
Asuna
405700101_44_a
So that means... This is how
the event starts?
Kirito
405700101_43_a
I don't think it's a glitch,
either...
Sinon
405700101_42_a
Wh-What do we do?
If we can't fly here, how are we
supposed to get home?!
Leafa
405700101_41_a
Sinon
405700101_40_a
Leafa
405700101_39_a
Whoa, you're right!
They're gone!
Yuuki
405700101_38_a
Look, I'll try to open them...
But nothing happens!
Kirito
405700101_37_a
Yui
405700101_36_a
Asuna
405700101_35_a
I don't think so. Normally,
we'd be able to feel our wings,
but I can't sense them at all!
Kirito
405700101_34_a
A-And we're sure we didn't just
accidentally put them away all
at once?
Yuuki
405700101_33_a
Leafa
405700101_32_a
Yuuki
405700101_31_a
And not just Kirito! You guys
have all lost your wings too!
Sinon
405700101_30_a
Yui
405700101_29_a
Kirito
405700101_28_a
Kirito, your wings!
They're disappearing!
Asuna
405700101_27_a
Sinon
405700101_26_a
Yuuki
405700101_25_a
What's wrong?
Wait...no way!
Leafa
405700101_24_a
Asuna
405700101_23_a
Yui
405700101_22_a
Huh?
My back feels strange...
Kirito
405700101_21_a
Yui
405700101_20_a
Asuna
405700101_19_a
Yep! Who knows what we're
gonna run into on this quest?
I can't wait!
Kirito
405700101_18_a
There's plenty of other fantasy
folk around, though! Like wizards
and giants and stuff.
Yuuki
405700101_17_a
We've only met other fairies here
in Alfheim too, right? Outside of
event quests, anyway.
Sinon
405700101_16_a
Yuuki
405700101_15_a
Leafa
405700101_14_a
Land of Men, huh?
I'd feel excluded, but I guess
we aren't human here.
Sinon
405700101_13_a
Kirito
405700101_12_a
Asuna
405700101_11_a
Yes. They call it "Midgard,"
the land of men.
Yui
405700101_10_a
Sinon
405700101_9_a
Yuuki
405700101_8_a
I hear the setting's meant to be
in human territory, so it's a long
way from Alfheim.
Leafa
405700101_7_a
But I bet this new campaign
quest will be worth it!
Asuna
405700101_6_a
Right. The journey over the sea
to get here took ages...
Asuna
405700101_5_a
Yes. In fact, this must be
the furthest we've been
from Alfheim proper.
Yui
405700101_4_a
Asuna
405700101_3_a
Yui
405700101_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
Phew! We finally made it...
Kirito
405700101_1_a
I cannot wait to have more fun.
Premiere
405501201_21_a
Sure! We'll be looking forward
to it.
Liz
405501201_20_a
I wish I could go, but I still
have stuff to do... I'll catch
up with you guys later!
Strea
405501201_19_a
I will follow your lead, Liz.
Premiere
405501201_18_a
Oh... Of course.
Premiere
405501201_17_a
We've only been able to enjoy
the Bon dance and this quest
so far, after all!
Liz
405501201_16_a
Let's look around the festival
some more!
Liz
405501201_15_a
But the day isn't done yet,
Premiere!
Liz
405501201_14_a
Aww, even Strea's getting
emotional!
Liz
405501201_13_a
You're showing real growth! I'm
so happy for you, as a fellow
NPC!
Strea
405501201_12_a
And that last quest... I think
I like myself a bit more than
before now.
Premiere
405501201_11_a
I was able to experience so many
things today.
Premiere
405501201_10_a
Yes. Thank you, Liz.
Premiere
405501201_9_a
Well, Premiere? Do you feel more
confident in yourself now?
Liz
405501201_8_a
Hehe, congratulations on beating
the quest!
Strea
405501201_7_a
We...did indeed.
Premiere
405501201_6_a
Yay, we did it!
Liz
405501201_5_a
Grawwrrrghhh!
Evil Soul
405501201_4_a
Strea
405501201_3_a
Liz
405501201_2_a
bg_event_festival
Yah!
Premiere
405501201_1_a
Sure! This'll be fun!
Strea
405501101_19_a
You help too, Strea!
Liz
405501101_18_a
Good work, Premiere! Now, let's
kick its ghostly butt!
Liz
405501101_17_a
Liz! The evil soul has appeared!
Premiere
405501101_16_a
gasp
Premiere
405501101_15_a
Premiere
405501101_14_a
Graaarrghh!!
???
405501101_13_a
Liz
405501101_12_a
Mm-hmm. Don't let your guard down.
The enemy's almost here...
Strea
405501101_11_a
So in other words...
Liz
405501101_10_a
Yup. Good job for figuring out the
trick to this mini-quest, Liz.
Strea
405501101_9_a
Strea! Were you watching this
whole time?
Liz
405501101_8_a
Hehe, it's to be expected. She's
got the highest learning ability
of any NPC I've seen.
Strea
405501101_7_a
I told her to imitate the others,
but she's doing it way better than
anyone else...
Liz
405501101_6_a
Wow... Premiere is doing amazing.
She's so elegant and ethereal...
Liz
405501101_5_a
Premiere
405501101_4_a
Yeah, it's so solemn,
yet graceful...
???
405501101_3_a
That girl's kagura is really
beautiful.
???
405501101_2_a
bg_event_festival
...
Premiere
405501101_1_a
It+
It+
Okay... I would like to test the
extent of my abilities.
Premiere
405501001_17_a
It+
...
Premiere
405501001_16_a
It+
Just imitate the others. See?
There's people dancing over
there.
Liz
405501001_15_a
It+
But I am unfamiliar with the
nuances of this dance...
Premiere
405501001_14_a
It+
Mm-hmm.
Liz
405501001_13_a
It+
You think the evil soul will
appear if a goddess dances the
kagura?
Premiere
405501001_12_a
It+
Well, goddesses are totally holy,
right? So I have a feeling this
quest is perfect for you.
Liz
405501001_11_a
It+
Kirito told me you kept your
goddess status when you converted
over to ALO.
Liz
405501001_10_a
It+
But why do you believe that I
should undertake this quest?
Premiere
405501001_9_a
It+
Defeat the soul to complete it.
Liz
405501001_8_a
It+
In this quest, an evil soul is
supposed to appear in front of
whoever dances it well.
Liz
405501001_7_a
It+
It's a holy dance that helps
bring peace to the souls of the
dead.
Liz
405501001_6_a
It+
What is a kagura...?
Premiere
405501001_5_a
It+
It's called the "Kagura Dance."
Liz
405501001_4_a
It+
We're inside the shrine grounds.
Strea told me there was going to
be a mini-quest here.
Liz
405501001_3_a
It+
Liz
405501001_2_a
It+
bg_event_festival
Liz... What is this place?
Premiere
405501001_1_a
Hmm?
Premiere
405500901_22_a
Goddesses aren't useless. In
fact, I bet this quest will prove
that's not the case.
Liz
405500901_21_a
Premiere...
Liz
405500901_20_a
But me? I have no special talents
to contribute to this festival.
Premiere
405500901_19_a
Liz, you are a great multitasker.
Strea is extremely intelligent.
Agil and Klein can play the drums.
Premiere
405500901_18_a
But that title has no meaning
here.
Premiere
405500901_17_a
You're a Goddess of Ainground,
after all.
Liz
405500901_16_a
Well, she's a bit of a special
case. Then again, so are you.
Liz
405500901_15_a
I am extremely impressed that
Strea was able to organize and
manage this entire event.
Premiere
405500901_14_a
Speaking of complicated, a lot
of tasks today were difficult
for me.
Premiere
405500901_13_a
...People are complicated.
Premiere
405500901_12_a
We can't mope around and put her
kindness to waste. The best way
to repay her is to have fun!
Liz
405500901_11_a
I do feel a little bad, but Strea
said it was okay.
Liz
405500901_10_a
Liz, was it morally correct for us
to leave in the middle of helping
Strea?
Premiere
405500901_9_a
...
Premiere
405500901_8_a
I love that anyone can
participate! It's easy enough
to learn on the spot, too.
Liz
405500901_7_a
Very much so.
Premiere
405500901_6_a
Premiere
405500901_5_a
How's your first Bon dance,
Premiere? Having fun?
Liz
405500901_4_a
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Agil
405500901_3_a
Agil
405500901_2_a
bg_event_festival
Yah! BOOM!
Klein
405500901_1_a
Liz, please slow down...
Wait for me...
Premiere
405500801_33_a
Come on! Let's go, Premiere!
Liz
405500801_32_a
Hehe, if you insist! Thank you!
Liz
405500801_31_a
You were both super helpful,
so I'm sure I can handle the rest.
Strea
405500801_30_a
Actually, why don't you two go
together? You've done enough.
Strea
405500801_29_a
Don't worry about it! I want you
to enjoy your first summer
festival!
Liz
405500801_28_a
But...
Premiere
405500801_27_a
I'll stay and help, and work
hard enough for two people!
Liz
405500801_26_a
Aww... I wish you'd told me
earlier! Sure she can go!
Strea
405500801_25_a
Liz...
Premiere
405500801_24_a
But I really want her to get a
chance to enjoy the festival's
main event.
Liz
405500801_23_a
but it was hard to ask for free
time when everything's so busy...
Liz
405500801_22_a
I wanted to show Premiere around
today,
Liz
405500801_21_a
But Liz, we still have many tasks
to perform...
Premiere
405500801_20_a
Hmm?
Strea
405500801_19_a
but would it be alright to let
Premiere go to the Bon dance?
Liz
405500801_18_a
Hey, Strea. I know there's still
more work to do,
Liz
405500801_17_a
...
Liz
405500801_16_a
...
Premiere
405500801_15_a
Right? That's why I asked them.
They were really excited!
Strea
405500801_14_a
And those two are perfect for the
job!
Liz
405500801_13_a
Good choice. You need a lot of
power and energy to play those
things right.
Liz
405500801_12_a
Yup! I think they're rehearsing
right now on top of the scaffold.
Strea
405500801_11_a
Really?! Those guys?!
Liz
405500801_10_a
Nope! I've asked Agil and Klein
to play them live.
Strea
405500801_9_a
Hey, Strea. Are these drums part
of the background music or
something?
Liz
405500801_8_a
Yes, the Bon dance must be
starting soon.
Liz
405500801_7_a
Strea
405500801_6_a
Liz
405500801_5_a
This sound again...
Premiere
405500801_4_a
Of course! Here we go!
Agil
405500801_3_a
Agil
405500801_2_a
bg_event_festival
Come on! You're not a real man
unless you can bang those drums
HARD! Let's DO THIS!!
Klein
405500801_1_a
We should get back to the job.
Premiere
405500701_21_a
Premiere...
Liz
405500701_20_a
Plus, spending time with you and
Strea is quite enjoyable.
Premiere
405500701_19_a
No. This is a rare opportunity to
have an experience normally
unavailable to me.
Premiere
405500701_18_a
Instead, we're spending all our
time helping Strea. Do you want to
take some time off to look around?
Liz
405500701_17_a
I did want to take you around
this festival and explain
everything to you.
Liz
405500701_16_a
Aww. I feel bad, Premiere.
Liz
405500701_15_a
But first, I must complete this
task given to me by Strea.
Premiere
405500701_14_a
Yes...
I am indeed a little interested.
Premiere
405500701_13_a
I'm getting the sense that you'd
like to try them.
Liz
405500701_12_a
...
Premiere
405500701_11_a
Corn dogs are sausages dipped in
a corn meal batter and then fried.
No dogs harmed.
Liz
405500701_10_a
Haha! No, Premiere. Hot dogs are
a type of sausage served in a bun.
Liz
405500701_9_a
Are they...canine cuisine?
Premiere
405500701_8_a
For example, these "hot dogs"
and "corn dogs" being sold at
this booth...
Premiere
405500701_7_a
Like what?
Liz
405500701_6_a
I have no idea what most of these
items on sale are.
Premiere
405500701_5_a
Something bothering you?
Liz
405500701_4_a
I believe I am fulfilling my
duties sufficiently well.
However...
Premiere
405500701_3_a
Premiere
405500701_2_a
bg_event_festival
How are you doing, Premiere?
Liz
405500701_1_a
Yes. Let us depart.
Premiere
405500601_25_a
Anyway, Premiere. Shall we get
on to our next task?
Liz
405500601_24_a
Haha, that's right.
Liz
405500601_23_a
Hehehe... That's 'cause I'm
originally an MHCP from SAO,
remember?
Strea
405500601_22_a
and yet it seems that your
knowledge and adaptability
always exceeds my own.
Premiere
405500601_21_a
I agree with Liz. I too am
a resident of this world,
Premiere
405500601_20_a
Sure! And might I add,
I'm impressed by how well you're
managing things, Strea.
Liz
405500601_19_a
Well, can I leave you two to it
then?
Strea
405500601_18_a
Plus, you can see all the sales
for each shop on this graph.
Strea
405500601_17_a
Another perk of VR, I guess.
Liz
405500601_16_a
Whoa, it's like a 360 degree
surveillance camera!
Liz
405500601_15_a
No need. You can see them right
here from this HoloWindow.
Strea
405500601_14_a
Should we go to the booths and
check them out one by one?
Liz
405500601_13_a
Make sure it's only authorized
booths, and that they're not
doing any shady business.
Strea
405500601_12_a
What sorts of things should we
be looking for?
Premiere
405500601_11_a
Could you check on the booths for
me? I need to keep an eye on them.
Strea
405500601_10_a
Great! So... I know you guys just
came back, but can I ask another
favor?
Strea
405500601_9_a
Yup. Premiere wrote up a patrol
report. She's very diligent.
Liz
405500601_8_a
I've included all the details
in this report.
Premiere
405500601_7_a
Haha, I appreciate it.
Strea
405500601_6_a
There was a little scuffle, but
we took care of it! Forcefully.
Heh heh heh.
Liz
405500601_5_a
How was it?
Strea
405500601_4_a
Liz
405500601_3_a
Yes. Our patrol is finished.
Premiere
405500601_2_a
bg_event_festival
Ah, you guys are back!
Strea
405500601_1_a
Ur+
Ur+
I see... There's still so much
I don't know.
Premiere
405500501_32_a
Ur+
And besides, it was Kirito and
Asuna who taught me how to do
that.
Liz
405500501_31_a
Ur+
Hey! You don't have to make
me sound like a bully!
Liz
405500501_30_a
Ur+
Then you hit them over and over
until they stopped. It must have
been very painful for them.
Premiere
405500501_29_a
Ur+
Wow, Liz. You hit them so hard
and fast they could not even
defend themselves.
Premiere
405500501_28_a
Ur+
Excellent. Good thing this is a
safe zone, or you wouldn't have
gotten off so easily.
Liz
405500501_27_a
Ur+
I-I'm sorry too...
I won't cause any more trouble...
Drunk Player B
405500501_26_a
Ur+
And YOU?
Liz
405500501_25_a
Ur+
I-I'm sorry...
I won't do it again...
Drunk Player A
405500501_24_a
Ur+
Yeah, that excuse isn't gonna
cut it.
Liz
405500501_23_a
Ur+
Aw, come on. We were just having
a little fun.
Drunk Player A
405500501_22_a
Ur+
Understood.
Premiere
405500501_21_a
Ur+
Whoops, I guess we spent too
long chatting. Hurry!
Liz
405500501_20_a
Ur+
Get him!
???
405500501_19_a
Ur+
Is that so?
Premiere
405500501_18_a
Ur+
In the real world, it'd be
impossible for me to hold
down a big muscly guy like that.
Liz
405500501_17_a
Ur+
I'm glad this is so easy in a
virtual world.
Liz
405500501_16_a
Ur+
Come on, Premiere. Let's go
apprehend those two.
Liz
405500501_15_a
Ur+
It appears that emotions are
complicated...
Premiere
405500501_14_a
Ur+
When you're having fun at a party
or festival, it's easy to get a
bit carried away sometimes.
Liz
405500501_13_a
Ur+
Actually, I kind of get it.
Liz
405500501_12_a
Ur+
Why would people fight at a
festival? They are supposed to
places of fun and joy.
Premiere
405500501_11_a
Ur+
Welp, didn't take very long to
find the belligerent fighting
drunks.
Liz
405500501_10_a
Ur+
I said watch where you're going,
loser!
???
405500501_9_a
Ur+
What did you just say to me,
you punk?!
???
405500501_8_a
Ur+
I see...
Premiere
405500501_7_a
Ur+
It's like the main event of a
summer festival.
Liz
405500501_6_a
Ur+
The dance itself isn't very
complicated, and it's mostly for
fun.
Liz
405500501_5_a
Ur+
It's a ceremony to honor the dead.
We dance in a circle around a
scaffold.
Liz
405500501_4_a
Ur+
Liz. What is a Bon dance?
Premiere
405500501_3_a
Ur+
Premiere
405500501_2_a
Ur+
bg_event_festival
Next, we patrol.
Liz
405500501_1_a
Ladies and Gentlemen. There will
be a Bon dance this afternoon.
We hope to see you there.
Premiere
405500401_29_a
I will try... I am quite nervous,
though...
Premiere
405500401_28_a
How about you read this part,
Premiere? Announcing is...fun...
Liz
405500401_27_a
Oh... Sorry...
Premiere
405500401_26_a
No! Bad Premiere!
You're part of the staff now.
You have to help, not play!
Strea
405500401_25_a
I would like to participate in
the search for this lost girl.
Premiere
405500401_24_a
Phew, that was nerve-wracking.
Liz
405500401_23_a
We're looking for a lost child...
She's a Sylph girl wearing a red
hat...
Liz
405500401_22_a
Right. 
cough
Liz
405500401_21_a
Liz, please. The announcement...
Premiere
405500401_20_a
Wow... Yeah. Ooh!
This quest looks
Liz
405500401_19_a
Here, look at this list! There are
tons of little quests lined up.
Strea
405500401_18_a
Ah, I see. Sounds like fun.
Liz
405500401_17_a
The lost kid is an NPC, and you
get a reward if you can return
her to her parents safely.
Strea
405500401_16_a
Calm down. This is just a
mini-quest prepared by the devs.
Strea
405500401_15_a
Wait a sec, why is a kid young
enough to get lost running around
in a VRMMO anyway?!
Liz
405500401_14_a
Really? You can get lost in a
virtual world?
Liz
405500401_13_a
All right. Hmm... An announcement
for a lost child?
Liz
405500401_12_a
Can we do the actual announcements
please? You just have to read
from this script.
Strea
405500401_11_a
Well... It's what everyone says
when they're testing the
microphone!
Liz
405500401_10_a
Excuse me, what is the point of
this "mic test"?
Premiere
405500401_9_a
Haha... Good point...
Liz
405500401_8_a
In fact, we don't even have
equipment.
Strea
405500401_7_a
I mean, yeah. I've seen people do
it on TV before, but I doubt we'll
run into equipment troubles here.
Strea
405500401_6_a
What? Don't all announcements
start with a mic test?
Liz
405500401_5_a
Liz, what was that?!
Strea
405500401_4_a
Premiere
405500401_3_a
Strea
405500401_2_a
bg_event_festival
Err... 
cough
Testing. One, two, three.
Liz
405500401_1_a
Roger that!
Strea
405500301_24_a
Strea, could you show us the
ropes?
Liz
405500301_23_a
If we're going to try something,
we might as well enjoy it!
Liz
405500301_22_a
All right! What's a VRMMO if you
can't get out of your comfort zone
and try new things?!
Liz
405500301_21_a
Aww, Premiere.
Liz
405500301_20_a
I do not mind. I am happy to help,
though my inexperience may
lead to mistakes.
Premiere
405500301_19_a
Aww. I don't want to force you
guys to do anything...
Strea
405500301_18_a
Guess we're stuck on work duty
for the rest of the day...
Liz
405500301_17_a
That's great! We're counting
on you!
Committee Member
405500301_16_a
Well, er... I won't lie. I don't
think I'd lose out to the average
player.
Liz
405500301_15_a
Really? So they're pretty strong?
Committee Member
405500301_14_a
Haha, these two don't need backup!
They can handle themselves!
Strea
405500301_13_a
We'll come help de-escalate if
there are.
Committee Member
405500301_12_a
I want you to let us know if there
are any belligerent drunk
festival-goers lurking about.
Committee Member
405500301_11_a
After that, could you patrol the
shrine?
Committee Member
405500301_10_a
Let's get right to business.
Could you help with the
announcements?
Committee Member
405500301_9_a
Aw, it's okay!
I know you can deliver!
Strea
405500301_8_a
H-Hey, Strea!
Don't talk us up TOO much!
Liz
405500301_7_a
Both of them are super talented,
so they can basically handle any
task you give them!
Strea
405500301_6_a
One is a player, and one is an
NPC like me.
Strea
405500301_5_a
Strea, you're a lifesaver!
Committee Member
405500301_4_a
Premiere
405500301_3_a
Liz
405500301_2_a
bg_event_festival
Hey, guys! I brought some helpers!
Strea
405500301_1_a
)q+
)q+
I have no objection.
Premiere
405500201_30_a
)q+
Wh-What should we do, Premiere?
Liz
405500201_29_a
)q+
It'd be really helpful to have
two people I trust on the scene.
Strea
405500201_28_a
)q+
Yeah.
We're low on staff right now.
Strea
405500201_27_a
)q+
Help...? Running the festival?
Liz
405500201_26_a
)q+
Anyway! If you guys are free,
I could really use some help!
Strea
405500201_25_a
)q+
Huh... Okay, whatever.
Liz
405500201_24_a
)q+
But they asked me to come on board
because I have great processing
skills.
Strea
405500201_23_a
)q+
Though I don't fit either of
those categories, being an AI
and all.
Strea
405500201_22_a
)q+
Well, the players and devs are
hosting this event jointly.
Strea
405500201_21_a
)q+
What?! Don't the devs handle the
operation side of these things?!
Liz
405500201_20_a
)q+
Actually, I'm part of the
executive committee!
Strea
405500201_19_a
)q+
Good tidings, Strea. Did you come
to observe the summer festival as
well?
Premiere
405500201_18_a
)q+
Strea?!
Liz
405500201_17_a
)q+
If it isn't Liz and Premiere!
Strea
405500201_16_a
)q+
GAH?!
Wait a sec, I know that voice!
Liz
405500201_15_a
)q+
HIYA!!
???
405500201_14_a
)q+
That would be great. Thank you.
Premiere
405500201_13_a
)q+
so I'll explain them one at a
time as we go by.
Liz
405500201_12_a
)q+
Mm-hmm. Those could be anything
from street food, to toys, to
carnival games,
Liz
405500201_11_a
)q+
It's all very exciting. Anyway,
Liz... About those booths lining
the path...
Premiere
405500201_10_a
)q+
I bet, especially if you're used
to ALO's Norse fantasy aesthetic.
Liz
405500201_9_a
)q+
I have never seen Arun decorated
like this before.
It is "mind-blowing."
Premiere
405500201_8_a
)q+
Those are the festival drums.
Don't you like how powerful they
sound?
Liz
405500201_7_a
)q+
And what is that booming sound
coming from afar?
Premiere
405500201_6_a
)q+
Those are paper lanterns. They're
used to light the paths,
but only during festivals.
Liz
405500201_5_a
)q+
What are those lights along the
road?
Premiere
405500201_4_a
)q+
They're called "nobori."
They advertise the different
booths.
Liz
405500201_3_a
)q+

405500201_2_a

bg_event_festival
What are all these flags?
They are impressive.
Premiere
405500201_1_a
Yes, please.
If you don't mind, that is.
Premiere
405500101_19_a
Don't worry, I'll explain
everything to you.
Liz
405500101_18_a
You seem interested!
Why don't we look around together?
Liz
405500101_17_a
A summer festival?
That sounds enjoyable.
Premiere
405500101_16_a
It's actually a Japanese summer
festival.
Liz
405500101_15_a
Could you explain to me the
purpose of this event?
Premiere
405500101_14_a
Festival? No.
As usual, I came to Arun to rest.
Premiere
405500101_13_a
Yeah, it's crazy. Did you come
to check out the festival too?
Liz
405500101_12_a
I'm sorry...
I was just overwhelmed by the
sheer number of people here.
Premiere
405500101_11_a
I could ask you the same! I called
out to you like twenty times.
Liz
405500101_10_a
Liz? Is something the matter?
Premiere
405500101_9_a
Phew, finally caught ya!
Liz
405500101_8_a
...
Premiere
405500101_7_a
Hey!
Liz
405500101_6_a
Hm? I thought I just saw Premiere
in the crowd...
Liz
405500101_5_a
...
Premiere
405500101_4_a
Too bad Kirito and Asuna aren't
in-game right now.
Liz
405500101_3_a
but it's not that fun when I'm by
myself, is it...
Liz
405500101_2_a
bg_event_festival
sigh
I came to Arun because
I heard there was a festival
event going on,
Liz
405500101_1_a
Nanairo
405201201_35_a
Nijika
405201201_34_a
Then, off we go!

405201201_33_a
Asuna
405201201_32_a
Shino
405201201_31_a
Don't worry!
We can all get
something and share!
Kazuto
405201201_30_a
My poor wallet...
Nijika
405201201_29_a
Yup! I'm gonna eat ALL the
foods! I won't be satisfied
until I try every last thing!
Nanairo
405201201_28_a
And, by that, I'm assuming
you mean...
Nijika
405201201_27_a
Nijika
405201201_26_a
Suguha
405201201_25_a
Yeah! We already cleared the
games, so that just leaves
one thing...
Nanairo
405201201_24_a
That's right! We're here
to enjoy the festival!
Let's make the most of it!
Asuna
405201201_23_a
Anyway, let's not forget why
we're here...
Kazuto
405201201_22_a
Asuna
405201201_21_a
Shino
405201201_20_a
Ha ha! Sure. You don't have to
make up your mind on the spot!
Kazuto
405201201_19_a
Hmmm...
I guess I'll think about it.
Nijika
405201201_18_a
Suguha
405201201_17_a
Nijika
405201201_16_a
What do you say, Nijika?
Nanairo
405201201_15_a
Asuna
405201201_14_a
Kazuto
405201201_13_a
True, but look at me. I'm not
the sporty type, but I can
still hold my own. So can you!
Shino
405201201_12_a
But, at the end of the day,
you really need to be fit to
play Ordinal Scale, don't you?
Nijika
405201201_11_a
I'm glad you liked it! I bet
playing VRMMOs for so long
helped you pick it up quickly.
Suguha
405201201_10_a
AR is way more fun than
I thought! I could see
myself getting into this.
Nanairo
405201201_9_a
Suguha
405201201_8_a
Nanairo
405201201_7_a
Heh heh...
Nijika
405201201_6_a
And we have the world's best
Ordinal Scale noobs to thank
for that.
Shino
405201201_5_a
Yeah! It was tough,
but we finally cleared it!
Asuna
405201201_4_a
Shino
405201201_3_a
Asuna
405201201_2_a

brave enough to fight again.

We would've been useless if it

his guns to see some action!

stall let us borrow them!

405201101_31_a
Got 'em at the ringtoss!
Heh heh!
Rain
405201101_30_a
Yes! But where on earth
did you find those
high-tier weapons?
Sinon
405201101_29_a
Seven
405201101_28_a
Did we make it in time?
Rain
405201101_27_a
Kirito
405201101_26_a
Asuna
405201101_25_a
And Rain, too!
What are you two doing here?!
Suguha
405201101_24_a
Graaaaaghk!
Monster
405201101_23_a
Haaah!
Rain
405201101_22_a
Suguha
405201101_21_a
Kirito
405201101_20_a
Look out!
Monster, six o'clock!
Asuna
405201101_19_a
GRAAAAAAAGH!
Monster
405201101_18_a
Suguha
405201101_17_a
Asuna
405201101_16_a
Seven?!
What are you doing here?!
Kirito
405201101_15_a
Hey! You blocked my shot!
I thought we were supposed
to be on the same team!
Sniper Player
405201101_14_a
HYAAAH!
Seven
405201101_13_a
Suguha
405201101_12_a
Asuna
405201101_11_a
What?!
Kirito
405201101_10_a
Look out!
Someone's pointing
a gun at us!
Sinon
405201101_9_a
...!
Sinon
405201101_8_a
Asuna
405201101_7_a
Kirito
405201101_6_a
Man, these guys are not
messing around about
those rank rewards...
Suguha
405201101_5_a
And, to make matters worse,
there's PvP breaking
out among the crowd!
Asuna
405201101_4_a
Suguha
405201101_3_a
Asuna
405201101_2_a
bg_event_festival
Ngh...! Jeez, these enemies
in the last stages are
ridiculously tough!
Kirito
405201101_1_a
Konechno!
Seven
405201001_25_a
Let's do this, Seven!
Rain
405201001_24_a
Go for broke, kids!
Ringtoss Attendant
405201001_23_a
Okay, mister! We'll take
you up on that offer!
Rain
405201001_22_a
If I can get back into that
same do-or-die mindset, maybe
I have a shot at this!
Rain
405201001_21_a
But...you've gotta start
somewhere, right? I need to
think back to being in SAO...
Rain
405201001_20_a
It's kind of a blow to
my self-esteem...
Rain
405201001_19_a
Maybe a little. Unlike ALO,
I hardly hold a candle to
the others here...
Rain
405201001_18_a
What's wrong, Rain?
Are you worried about
joining the battle again?
Seven
405201001_17_a
I guess...
Rain
405201001_16_a
We can use them to help
out Kirito and the others
after all!
Seven
405201001_15_a
There's no way a beginner
could ever get their hands
on them!
Seven
405201001_14_a
Wow!
These weapons are incredible!
I bet they're super-rare!
Seven
405201001_13_a
Ha ha! Yeah, I'm obsessed!
But I can't play this event,
since I'm on duty here...
Ringtoss Attendant
405201001_12_a
Whoa! Are you into
Ordinal Scale, too, mister?
Rain
405201001_11_a
Tell ya what. How about I loan
you my custom D-Weapons and
you go waste some DBAs for me?
Ringtoss Attendant
405201001_10_a
I gotta say, you two are
pretty great shots.
Ringtoss Attendant
405201001_9_a
Yup, I guess so.
Rain
405201001_8_a
Oh, that's right...
Okay. I guess that means we've
cleared this area, then!
Seven
405201001_7_a
And there are only so many
points you can earn at each
game, you know...
Ringtoss Attendant
405201001_6_a
We're gonna run out of
prizes if you keep this up!
Ringtoss Attendant
405201001_5_a
Huh?
Rain
405201001_4_a
Rain
405201001_3_a
Seven
405201001_2_a
bg_event_festival
L-Listen, kids...
don't you think
you've had enough?
Ringtoss Attendant
405201001_1_a
Sinon
405200901_24_a
Ready!
Asuna
405200901_23_a
Suguha
405200901_22_a
So! Are we ready?
Kirito
405200901_21_a
Asuna
405200901_20_a
Heh! That's the spirit.
Sinon
405200901_19_a
Suguha
405200901_18_a
Ha ha! But high-stakes battles
are exactly my idea of a
good time!
Kirito
405200901_17_a
I thought people were just
here for a good time at the
festival.
Sinon
405200901_16_a
Sinon
405200901_15_a
And since you can get points
on the midway, there's going
to be even more competition.
Asuna
405200901_14_a
Kirito
405200901_13_a
They've been hyping this event
for a while, so there are lots
of hardcore players here, too.
Suguha
405200901_12_a
Asuna
405200901_11_a
Right behind you, Kirito.
Sinon
405200901_10_a
Suguha
405200901_9_a
Sounds good, but we're here to
fight, and we have to focus on
raising our ranks first.
Kirito
405200901_8_a
Ha ha! I bet you'd be
a natural, Sinonon!
Asuna
405200901_7_a
Asuna
405200901_6_a
I wouldn't mind trying the
shooting gallery...
Sinon
405200901_5_a
But if we handle the monsters
and leave the midway to them,
we can all do our part!
Suguha
405200901_4_a
Yeah!
I feel kinda bad about leaving
Rain and Seven behind.
Suguha
405200901_3_a
Suguha
405200901_2_a
bg_event_festival
Alright!
Let's head back to those DBAs!
Kirito
405200901_1_a
Yeah...
Seven
405200801_17_a
but it's still kinda sad
to have to split the party...
Rain
405200801_16_a
Maybe a little. I know that
AR and VR are two totally
different ways of gaming,
Rain
405200801_15_a
Well, aren't you?
Seven
405200801_14_a
Gee, Nana... You're kinda
upset about that, huh?
Rain
405200801_13_a
it seems pretty hopeless
for beginners like us to even
try against the DBAs... 
sigh
Seven
405200801_12_a
I guess so.
But even that first battle
was so intense that
Seven
405200801_11_a
Do you want to head back
to the game stalls?
Rain
405200801_10_a
Heh heh. Looks like it. In the
end, we all gravitated to the
easiest way for us to score.
Rain
405200801_9_a
Where'd the others go, though?
Back to fighting the monsters?
Seven
405200801_8_a
Cool! Maybe I'll give that
a try, too.
Rain
405200801_7_a
Yeah!
I was thinking of trying
my luck at the ringtoss next!
Seven
405200801_6_a
Woo hoo! Me, too!
The midway games make it
fair to everyone in the end!
Rain
405200801_5_a
Rain
405200801_4_a
Hee hee!
I got a whole load of points already!
Seven
405200801_3_a
Hi, there, Nana!
How's it going?
Rain
405200801_2_a
bg_event_festival
Raaaaain! Over here!
Seven
405200801_1_a
we get to enjoy the
festival in all of its
AR glory!
Seven
405200701_27_a
We weren't much help
fighting the monsters,
but at least this way
Seven
405200701_26_a
This must be how they planned
on getting newbies involved
in Ordinal Scale, too.
Sinon
405200701_25_a
So Kirito's hunch about there
being a beginner-friendly mode
turned out to be true.
Suguha
405200701_24_a
That means me and Rain have
a fighting chance!
Seven
405200701_23_a
Yeah!
You can really rack up points
here on the midway!
Suguha
405200701_22_a
Wow! Kirito was right
about the mini-games!
Sinon
405200701_21_a
Huh? Points...?
You mean, for Ordinal Scale?!
Seven
405200701_20_a
Here's your penny candy...
plus 80 points!
Candy-Cutting Attendant
405200701_19_a
Naturally!
Seven
405200701_18_a
Good job, little lady!
You're pretty talented.
Candy-Cutting Attendant
405200701_17_a
sniffle
...
Suguha
405200701_16_a
But maaaybe you should
stick to sports
after all, Leafa...
Sinon
405200701_15_a
Hee hee! I've always had a
knack for arts and crafts.
Seven
405200701_14_a
You're pretty good
at this, Seven!
Sinon
405200701_13_a
Hey, Leafa!
Check this out!
I made three already!
Seven
405200701_12_a
Gah!
I ruined it!
Suguha
405200701_11_a
So you just take the little
carving knife like so, and...
Suguha
405200701_10_a
Alright!
Let's give it our best shot!
Suguha
405200701_9_a
Wow, this looks like fun!
And you don't have to run or
anything, so even I can do it!
Seven
405200701_8_a
At any rate, win the AR version
and I'll give ya some gummy bears.
Candy-Cutting Attendant
405200701_7_a
Heh heh! Not since health
inspectors started cracking
down on these games...
Candy-Cutting Attendant
405200701_6_a
I thought the point was to eat
the candy after you've cut it
into the right shape.
Sinon
405200701_5_a
How would that even
work in AR, though...?
Sinon
405200701_4_a
Sinon
405200701_3_a
Seven
405200701_2_a
bg_event_festival
Wow!
This candy-cutting game
is set up with AR!
Suguha
405200701_1_a
They must've noticed
the same thing by now!
Kirito
405200601_21_a
Heh heh. That's right!
Anyway, let's go find Leafa
and the others.
Kirito
405200601_20_a
That's awesome! So the points
just sweeten the deal on the
carnival experience!
Rain
405200601_19_a
from these games too,
not just the DBA battles!
Asuna
405200601_18_a
Yep! Isn't that cool?
The crossover means you
can get points
Asuna
405200601_17_a
Points...?
Oh! For Ordinal Scale?
Rain
405200601_16_a
Winner, winner, chicken
dinner! Here's your prize,
plus 50 points!
Shooting Gallery Attendant
405200601_15_a
BAM!
Bull's-eye!
Kirito
405200601_14_a
So I just take this,
aim at the target, and...
Kirito
405200601_13_a
That seems about right.
Asuna
405200601_12_a
Okay...
See? The gun comes up on
the display as a D-Weapon.
Kirito
405200601_11_a
Go right ahead.
Use this BB gun.
Shooting Gallery Attendant
405200601_10_a
Can we get one play, mister?
Kirito
405200601_9_a
See for yourself!
Kirito
405200601_8_a
Err, okay...
Now, how does this work?
Rain
405200601_7_a
It's true! Look.
An Ordinal Scale
window pops up.
Asuna
405200601_6_a
All these games
are AR-enabled.
Kirito
405200601_5_a
Rain
405200601_4_a
Asuna
405200601_3_a
Kirito
405200601_2_a
bg_event_festival
Hey there, lad!
Seems you've figured it out.
Shooting Gallery Attendant
405200601_1_a
It's worth a look, right?
Kirito
405200501_47_a
Suguha
405200501_46_a
Asuna
405200501_45_a
No way! You mean...?!
Sinon
405200501_44_a
Suguha
405200501_43_a
Asuna
405200501_42_a
Right! Like shooting
galleries, ringtoss,
the candy-cutting game...
Sinon
405200501_41_a
And the midway has all kinds
of mini-games set up!
Kirito
405200501_40_a
Sinon
405200501_39_a
Suguha
405200501_38_a
As far as I know.
Asuna
405200501_37_a
You have to register with
the festival organizers to
set up a stall here, right?
Kirito
405200501_36_a
Sinon
405200501_35_a
Suguha
405200501_34_a
Huh? What's it?
Asuna
405200501_33_a
Somewhere like...
Aha! That's it!
Kirito
405200501_32_a
But, if it was me, I'd have it
hidden in some out-of-the-way
spot.
Kirito
405200501_31_a
True. A lot of festival stalls
and midway games, but no item
drops or anything...
Kirito
405200501_30_a
Asuna
405200501_29_a
Sinon
405200501_28_a
But we've done a sweep of the
whole area and we haven't
seen anything like that.
Suguha
405200501_27_a
Yeah, something like that!
There's gotta be a way to rack
up points besides battles...
Kirito
405200501_26_a
Suguha
405200501_25_a
Asuna
405200501_24_a
You mean, something like item
or material drops that give
you lots of points in one go?
Sinon
405200501_23_a
Exactly.
Kirito
405200501_22_a
Sinon
405200501_21_a
Suguha
405200501_20_a
So you'd think there'd be
something set up to level
the playing field, right?
Asuna
405200501_19_a
And Ordinal Scale is so
mainstream, they must've known
there'd be lots of newcomers.
Asuna
405200501_18_a
I think I get it, Kirito.
All kinds of people come
to festivals.
Asuna
405200501_17_a
Sinon
405200501_16_a
Asuna
405200501_15_a
Huh? So what are you saying?
Suguha
405200501_14_a
I mean, why would they open
an event to beginners but
make it impossible to play?
Kirito
405200501_13_a
Right.
And doesn't that seem
a little weird to you?
Kirito
405200501_12_a
I'll say!
The enemies here would wipe
the floor with a beginner.
Sinon
405200501_9_a
Suguha
405200501_11_a
Asuna
405200501_10_a
Asuna
405200501_8_a
Sinon
405200501_7_a
That's probably for the best.
The DBAs spawning here are
no joke.
Suguha
405200501_6_a
She's retreated to a
safe zone for now.
Kirito
405200501_5_a
Sinon
405200501_4_a
Suguha
405200501_3_a
Kirito, there you are!
Where's Rain?
Asuna
405200501_2_a
bg_event_festival
Hey, Asuna!
Everyone!
Kirito
405200501_1_a
Still, what, Kirito?
Rain
405200401_33_a
But, still...
Kirito
405200401_32_a
If that's who they're pitching
this event to, I can see how
it'd be hard for first-timers.
Kirito
405200401_31_a
I guess you have a point.
There sure are a lot of
ranked players here.
Kirito
405200401_30_a
That means it's pointless
for newbies like us to even
try in an event like this.
Seven
405200401_29_a
The skill system is all about
hierarchy and experience.
Seven
405200401_28_a
Plus, your stats in
Ordinal Scale all depend
on your rank, right?
Seven
405200401_27_a
I'm sorry, Kirito...
This isn't like
virtual reality at all.
Rain
405200401_26_a
You're a front-line fighter
in ALO, just like me.
Are you feeling okay?
Kirito
405200401_25_a
I know Seven's not used to
attacking, but I thought you'd
get the hang of it, Rain...
Kirito
405200401_24_a
Yeesh!
I had no idea the Augma would
be THIS hard to figure out.
Rain
405200401_23_a
Ha ha! I know it's a little
weird at first, but the more
you play, the easier it gets.
Kirito
405200401_22_a
But I can't make my body move
the way I want...! Even though
this is the real world!
Seven
405200401_21_a
You think so? How come?
The graphics are
about the same.
Kirito
405200401_20_a
Waaagh! This is scary!
Way, way scarier than VR!
Seven
405200401_19_a
Yeah...somehow.
Rain
405200401_18_a
Seven
405200401_17_a
Rain
405200401_16_a
bg_event_festival
Phew...
Hey! Are you guys okay?

HYAAAH!
Kirito

NOW who's a little geek?!
Seven
405200401_11_a
H-How did I miss?!
Rain
405200401_10_a
Grargh?!
Monster
405200401_9_a
Now it's my turn...
Take THIS!
Rain
405200401_8_a
I-It's not my fault!
I couldn't judge the
distance, s-so...
Seven
405200401_7_a
Seven!
You'll never land
a hit like that!
Rain
405200401_6_a
Graaawh?!
Monster
405200401_5_a
HIYAAAH!
Seven
405200401_4_a

405200301_47_a
Asuna
405200301_46_a
Ha ha! I see...
Well, we'll just have
to see how it goes.
Kazuto
405200301_45_a
Hey! I'm not a geek!
I'm a nerd.
Nanairo
405200301_44_a
I know it makes sense for
a little geek like Nanairo,
but--
Nijika
405200301_43_a
Th-There's no easy
way to say it...
We're totally out of shape!
Nijika
405200301_42_a
You guys got all
quiet all of a sudden...
Don't you two like sports?
Shino
405200301_41_a
...
Nanairo
405200301_40_a
Shino
405200301_39_a
Nanairo
405200301_38_a
Heh heh heh... Yeah... Yukata.
Nijika
405200301_37_a
Suguha
405200301_36_a
Asuna
405200301_35_a
Only problem is...how agile
can you be in yukata?
Kazuto
405200301_34_a
Kazuto
405200301_33_a
Suguha
405200301_32_a
That's right!
The more agile you are,
the better your stats!
Asuna
405200301_31_a
Don't you just move
your body in real time?
Nijika
405200301_30_a
Maybe... But, then again,
Ordinal Scale is
augmented reality, right?
Nijika

Kazuto
405200301_23_a
No Augma? No problem!
Just head on down to reception
for rental devices!
Announcer
405200301_22_a
I do have one I bought as a

Do you all have Augmas? I play
it sometimes now that they've
fixed the safety issues...
Shino

Nijika
405200301_11_a
Nanairo

Hmm?
Kazuto
405200201_22_a

a bit old-fashioned.

Next time, they oughta

Yuuki

about losing to that NPC...
Yuuki
405101201_26_a

Kirito
405101201_22_a
you came to our rescue.
Asuna
405101201_21_a
Just this once, Kirito!
Think of it as repayment
for all the times
Asuna
405101201_20_a
Asuna
405101201_19_a
Heh heh! So am I the

Yuuki
405101201_17_a

And the girl saves the prince,
to boot!
Silica
405101201_15_a
True. But I really
liked this version!
Silica
405101201_14_a
This was a far cry from
the ol' "The Weaver Girl
and the Cowherd" story.
Philia
405101201_13_a
Silica
405101201_12_a
Yuuki
405101201_11_a
That's where it matches up
with the Tanabata story
we're familiar with!
Philia
405101201_10_a
Kirito
405101201_9_a
But he relented a little
in the end and agreed to let
them meet just once a year.
Asuna
405101201_8_a
Kirito
405101201_7_a
Yep! In the original,
Ame-no-Wakahiko's dad
would have caught us.
Asuna
405101201_6_a
Silica
405101201_5_a
Philia

I guess so.
Asuna
405101001_28_a
So we've got to think
of a way to get past him
without a fight, huh?
Philia
405101001_27_a
But that's when I realized...
He doesn't have an HP bar.
He must be an NPC!
Yuuki
405101001_26_a
I thought that if
I could take him out,
we'd be all set!
Yuuki
405101001_25_a
Yuuki!
How could you be so reckless?!
Asuna
405101001_24_a
I tried challenging him,
but he hit super hard, and
I couldn't even make a dent.
Yuuki
405101001_23_a
Heh heh. Well...
I figured that big shot
was Ame-no-Wakahiko's dad.
Yuuki
405101001_22_a
All right!
But...Yuuki, aren't you
a little low on HP?
Asuna
405101001_21_a
Yeah!
Silica
405101001_20_a
Nice going, Yuuki!
Let's go bust him out!
Philia
405101001_19_a
I bet he's keeping Kirito
locked up in there!
Yuuki
405101001_18_a
I found him!
I saw this big shot
coming out of a hidden door.
Yuuki
405101001_17_a
Yuuki! You're back!
Asuna
405101001_16_a
Guys!
Yuuki
405101001_15_a
Right!
Philia
405101001_14_a
Once Yuuki's back from recon,
we'll try for a second
run on the palace.
Asuna
405101001_13_a
Yeah.
It's just the way this event
is, so we have to accept it.
Asuna
405101001_12_a
We can't communicate
between party members
unless we're together.
Silica
405101001_11_a
Yeah...
I wish we could message
each other, though.
Silica
405101001_10_a
They won't spot us
any time soon.
Let's focus on strategy.
Philia
405101001_9_a
Yeah, relax!
It took a Spriggan like me
to find this hiding spot.
Philia
405101001_8_a

We can't give up now.
Asuna
405101001_7_a

coming at us like this?
Silica
405101001_6_a

make it to Kirito

Wow. I never knew
this was part of
the Tanabata story.
Kirito
405100901_1_a
Time for some pest control!
Silica
405100801_25_a
Ugh, yeah.
Let's get this over with!
Silica
405100801_24_a
Eww!
Look at its legs!
It's so gross!
Philia
405100801_23_a
Oh, that's right! I read about
Ame-no-Wakahiko's dad sending
centipedes to smite you!
Yuuki
405100801_22_a
That monster...
It's a giant centipede!
Asuna
405100801_21_a
Skraaawwwr!
???
405100801_20_a
And we've been through
plenty of trials to
prepare for this stage!
Silica
405100801_19_a
Yeah! We represent
the celestial bodies.
Philia
405100801_18_a
We'll show that god!
Yuuki
405100801_17_a
Don't stress!
You've got us three
for back-up!
Yuuki
405100801_16_a
Yeah... And he's a god,
too, so I'm worried about
what he'll do.
Asuna
405100801_15_a
Bet his old man won't
be too happy about that.
Yuuki
405100801_14_a
then I get to see
Ame-no-Wakahiko again.
Asuna
405100801_13_a
This says the next step
is to cross into heaven
and pass the trials,
Asuna
405100801_12_a
And they help out...
um, Asuna's character.
Silica
405100801_11_a
This version has a lot
more characters in it...
like us!
Silica
405100801_10_a
Yeah! The story I grew up with
only had cowherd boy Hikoboshi
and weaver girl Orihime.
Philia
405100801_9_a
but it's changed with
each telling over the years.
Asuna
405100801_8_a
The origin was the story
of Ame-no-Wakahiko,
Asuna
405100801_7_a
but I'm reading up now
about Tanabata.
Asuna
405100801_6_a
I didn't have time before,
Asuna
405100801_5_a
Whatcha looking at
in that window, Asuna?

Asuna
405100801_1_a
Great! Let's get going, then!
Yuuki
405100701_21_a
Thanks, guys!
I owe you one!
Asuna
405100701_20_a
You can count on us
three to help you out.
Silica
405100701_19_a
But now it's clear.
We're supposed to get
you back to Kirito!
Silica
405100701_18_a
We'll just have to call
you "Asuna," like always.
Philia
405100701_17_a
Your character doesn't really
have a name, Asuna. That makes
things kind of confusing.
Philia
405100701_16_a
One thing, though...
Philia
405100701_15_a
Yup!
It took us a while to
figure all that out, though.
Philia
405100701_14_a
Yuuzutsu is Venus,
"Houkiboshi" is a comet,
and "Subaru" is the Pleiades.
Asuna
405100701_13_a
Oh! Those are names from
Japanese astrology, right?
Asuna
405100701_12_a
Yuuzutsu, Houkiboshi
and Subaru!
Yuuki
405100701_11_a
We're here to help!
Behold, the heroes rushing
to the bride's aid!
Yuuki
405100701_10_a
You did? And what are you
guys going to do now?
Asuna
405100701_9_a
That's right. But we saw what
happened to you and Kirito.
Philia
405100701_8_a
Yeah!
It took us ages just
to meet up again.
Silica

405100501_26_a
Here's hoping!
Well, I guess I'm off for now.
Kirito
405100501_25_a
Not this time, it won't!
Asuna
405100501_24_a
Funny how the boxes
in myths like this always
end up getting opened...
Kirito
405100501_23_a
Oh, no!
Asuna
405100501_22_a
Ame-no-Wakahiko says--I mean,
I say, "If you open this box,
I can never return."
Kirito
405100501_21_a
And what am I supposed
to do with it?
Asuna
405100501_20_a
This thing?
Kirito
405100501_19_a
Just temporarily! It says,
"Hand the item marked
'treasure chest' to the girl."
Kirito
405100501_18_a
What?!
Already?
Asuna
405100501_17_a
I return to heaven?
Kirito
405100501_16_a
Oh, it's another story prompt...
Huh?
Kirito
405100501_15_a
Yeah, me, too.
Kirito
405100501_14_a
Ha ha! Yeah, good idea.
Hey, I wonder how Yuuki
and the others are doing...
Asuna
405100501_13_a
I just hope knowing the story
in advance doesn't count as
cheating. Heh heh.
Kirito
405100501_12_a
Anyhow... Now that we have
the time, let's study up
on our Tanabata lore.
Kirito
405100501_11_a
Yeah, you're probably right.
Asuna
405100501_10_a
so we could buy that
little log cabin back again...
Kirito
405100501_9_a
Me, too. And I remember
the intense battle we
fought in New Aincrad,
Kirito
405100501_8_a
Living there with you
is a really precious
memory to me.
Asuna
405100501_7_a
Yeah... Even though we
didn't get to spend
that much time there...
Asuna
405100501_6_a
Ah, you mean when we bought
that little log cabin in SAO?
Kirito
405100501_5_a
Something about this
domestic situation kind of
reminds me of old times.
Asuna

a role-playing game.

that are pretty different

versions of Tanabata

Mommy, Daddy, did you hear?
ALO's doing another crossover.
Yui
405100101_1_a
Hehe! In other words, count us in!
Seven
405001201_47_
Da, da! Konechno!
Seven
405001201_46_
Seven
405001201_45_
Right!
Rain
405001201_44_
Asuna
405001201_43_
Ha ha! I know what you mean.
You two are coming with us, right?
Kirito
405001201_42_
Funny how we came all the way here
but still haven't taken a dip.
Asuna
405001201_41_
Yeah. We can check out the pool
once we get our strength back.
Asuna
405001201_40_
Asuna
405001201_39_
Any time! So, I guess we should
go find the others.
Kirito
405001201_38_
Rain
405001201_37_
Yeah! Kirito, Asuna!
Spasiba so much!
Seven
405001201_36_
We should be thanking you!
Rain
405001201_35_
Seven
405001201_34_
Haha! It's no problem!
After all, we're the ones who
started this quest to begin with.
Rain
405001201_33_
Asuna
405001201_32_
We couldn't have done it without
you!
Kirito
405001201_31_
Wow... So that's how it works!
Asuna
405001201_30_
If you weren't such good singers,
we would've been out of luck!
Kirito
405001201_29_
I got Yui to check, and apparently
the buff depends on singing skill.
Kirito
405001201_28_
Kirito
405001201_27_
And we have our two all-star
songstresses to thank for that!
Asuna
405001201_26_
Seven
405001201_25_
Yeah, I think we pulled it off!
It got a bit dicey there,
but we won!
Rain
405001201_24_
Rain
405001201_23_
Phew! Did that do the trick?
Seven
405001201_22_
Seven
405001201_21_
Right!
Rain
405001201_20_
Asuna
405001201_19_
All right, guys!
Let's do this!
Kirito
405001201_18_
Seven
405001201_17_
Ahaha, yup!
Rain
405001201_16_
Rain
405001201_15_
Hehehe... Well, I'm just glad our
songs are buffing you! It feels
great to be appreciated!
Seven
405001201_14_
Asuna
405001201_13_
Good point. Making victory
contingent on one specific person
would be a bit of a tall order...
Kirito
405001201_12_
Kirito
405001201_11_
Seems so! I guess it'd be
impossible to beat if you
needed Yuna, after all...
Asuna
405001201_10_
Rain
405001201_9_
So it won't grant stat boosts like
Yuna, but it seems that anyone's
singing can empower you!
Seven
405001201_8_
Seven
405001201_7_
You're right! Our stats haven't
changed, but our DPS is off the
charts!
Rain
405001201_6_
Kirito
405001201_5_
You did it! That super buff is
working! It's doubling our damage!
Asuna
405001201_4_
Grrraaaghhh!!
Monster

Kirito
405001201_1_
Rain
405001101_56_
...
Seven
405001101_55_
Asuna
405001101_54_
Exactly. Besides, you look up to
Yuna, don't you? Don't you think
it's worth the shot?
Kirito
405001101_53_
Rain
405001101_52_
Well, I don't like to brag, but...
Ahem. Anyway, you're saying
if we sing in OS, we'll buff you?
Seven
405001101_51_
Asuna
405001101_50_
But you two are singers too.
And pretty awesome ones, right?
Kirito
405001101_49_
I've never heard of any music
giving buffs before, except for
Yuna's.
Kirito
405001101_48_
Asuna
405001101_47_
We've been under the impression
that Yuna's songs are special.
Kirito
405001101_46_
Seven
405001101_45_
Umm, sure? What's the plan?
Rain
405001101_44_
Asuna
405001101_43_
Seven, Rain, I have an idea. It's
desperate and probably won't work,
but do you want to give it a shot?
Kirito
405001101_42_
Asuna
405001101_41_
...
Kirito
405001101_40_
Rain
405001101_39_
Rain's right...
Seven
405001101_38_
Seven
405001101_37_
I don't think it'll help, Kirito.
Our attacks will just bounce
off without that buff...
Rain
405001101_36_
Asuna
405001101_35_
Rats, what do we do? Maybe...add
everyone to the party and see if
that'll be enough firepower?
Kirito
405001101_34_
Kirito
405001101_33_
So we were too late after all...
I guess the buff wore off when
the concert ended...
Asuna
405001101_32_
Liz
405001101_31_
Suguha
405001101_30_
Me neither. My OS avatar's stats
haven't changed at all...

405001101_28_
Silica
405001101_27_
Huh? Buff? What are you talking
about? I don't see any buff.
Suguha
405001101_26_
Asuna
405001101_25_
They should still be buffed!
Kirito
405001101_24_
Asuna
405001101_23_
Of course...
They were listening to Yuna's
concert much longer than we were.
Kirito
405001101_22_
Seven
405001101_21_
Wait! I got it! Liz, you guys
are still buffed, right?
Rain
405001101_20_
Rain
405001101_19_
N-No way...
Seven
405001101_18_

my life's complete.

Hey, it's Kirito and Asuna.
And Seven and Rain too.
What were they doing?
Sinon
405001101_1_
Seven
405001001_34_
S-Sure!
Rain
405001001_33_
Kirito
405001001_32_
Then let's head back to the stage!
Asuna
405001001_31_
Rain
405001001_30_
I-I was just about to say that!
That's our only chance!
Seven
405001001_29_
Asuna
405001001_28_
Why don't we head back to Yuna's
concert and get rebuffed?
Kirito
405001001_27_
What do we do? We can't beat
those monsters like this - they're
too tough!
Asuna
405001001_26_
An event where NPCs jump in
and mess with you... I've never
seen this in OS before...
Kirito
405001001_25_
Kirito
405001001_24_
It seems that way...
Asuna
405001001_23_
Seven
405001001_22_
So these "Aggressors" stopped us
from beating those monsters?
Rain
405001001_21_
Asuna
405001001_20_
They'll do anything for points,
even attack other Adapts,
such as ourselves.
Kirito
405001001_19_
Aggressors are a splinter group of
Adapts. Extremists, separate to
normal players in the OS world.
Kirito
405001001_18_
Kirito
405001001_17_
So the same thing happened to
you too...
Asuna
405001001_16_
Rain
405001001_15_
We had to flee for our lives!
Seven
405001001_14_
We couldn't beat those monsters
because of that stupid dispel!
Seven
405001001_13_
Seven
405001001_12_
Y-Yeah... NPCs calling themselves
Aggressors popped out of nowhere
and dispelled our buffs...
Rain
405001001_11_
I think I can guess what
happened. "Aggressors"?

What are they doing here?!
Kirito

Aggressors?
Aren't they OS extremists?!
Asuna

We. Are. Aggressors.
NPC
405000901_25_
What?! So that bright light
was a dispel?!
Kirito
405000901_24_
Be careful!
Your buff's gone!

405000901_23_
Y-Yeah... I'm fine...
At least, I think I am...
Asuna
405000901_22_
Asuna... Are you okay?
Kirito

Kirito

Haaah!
NPC

Asuna
405000901_16_
NPCs? Why would an NPC interfere
in a fight with a DBA?
Kirito
405000901_15_
They're NPCs!
Characters in OS!
Yui
405000901_14_
Yui?!
What's going on?!
Asuna
405000901_13_
Mommy! Daddy! Look out!
Yui
405000901_12_
Hey, jerks. You angling to
steal our last attack bonus
and rank up? Is that it?
Kirito
405000901_11_
Huh...? You guys are...players?
Asuna
405000901_10_

???
405000901_9_
Who's there?!
Kirito
405000901_8_
We won't...let you do that...
???
405000901_7_
Yeah!
Kirito
405000901_6_
Roger!
Same plan as earlier. Let's go!
Asuna
405000901_5_
Asuna, enemy spawned!
Kirito
405000901_4_
Asuna
405000901_3_
Kirito
405000901_2_
bg_event_swimming_pool
Graaawr!
Monster
405000901_1_
Got it!
Asuna
405000801_25_
Anyway! I'm pretty sure a monster
is going to spawn here any second.
Let's stay on our toes.
Kirito
405000801_24_
Yeah... You're right.
Asuna
405000801_23_
Besides... I'd like to believe
that Yuna lives on in Seven's
heart too...
Kirito
405000801_22_
No... Let's not. Seven admires her.
It'd hurt her if she knew what
happened...
Kirito
405000801_21_
Should we tell Seven?
About Yuna, I mean.
Asuna
405000801_20_
The SAO reference book that just
got published had a section about
her. Seven must have read it.
Kirito
405000801_19_
She just might be...
Yuna made an impact on everyone
she met in SAO.
Kirito
405000801_18_
That's the Yuna we knew in SAO,
isn't it? I remember her.
Asuna
405000801_17_
That person Seven admired,
Aincrad's songstress...
Asuna
405000801_16_
Yeah, what's up, Asuna?
Kirito
405000801_15_
Hey, Kirito?
Asuna
405000801_14_
Asuna
405000801_13_

Kirito
405000801_12_
Kirito
405000801_11_
Right. Good luck!
Asuna
405000801_10_
Rain
405000801_9_
Got it. Rain and I will take the
ones over there.
Seven
405000801_8_
Asuna
405000801_7_
Good idea. Yuna's buff might
wear off if we don't hurry.
Kirito
405000801_6_
So there are. Should we split
up to take them out?
Asuna
405000801_5_
Asuna
405000801_4_
Yeah, and some in the opposite
direction too.
Kirito
405000801_3_
Seven
405000801_2_
bg_event_swimming_pool
Hey look, there are still some
enemies lurking over by that pool.
Rain
405000801_1_
Kirito
405000701_28_
Ahaha, that's just like you,
Seven. You never hold back.
Asuna
405000701_27_
Rain
405000701_26_
I despise her!
Seven
405000701_25_
I thought I explained myself
earlier. She's a VRMMO idol.
Thus, a rival!
Seven
405000701_24_
That's...surprising.
Rain
405000701_23_
That's why I just noticed the
similarity.
Seven
405000701_22_
Well, I never actually listened
to Yuna sing before.
Seven
405000701_21_
You never mentioned that Yuna
reminded you of this songstress
before. Why suddenly now?
Rain
405000701_20_
There's no way I can prove if
they're linked at all... Still,
something about her is bugging me.
Seven
405000701_19_
Rain
405000701_18_
Y-Yeah... But the info on that
songstress is really dated, and
I checked it all myself.
Seven
405000701_17_
Asuna
405000701_16_
Seven... That girl -Aincrad's
songstress- and Yuna are a lot
alike, aren't they?
Kirito
405000701_15_
Rain
405000701_14_
Yuna's buff, huh?
Seven
405000701_13_
Asuna
405000701_12_
Definitely. I don't think we four
could've won without it.
Kirito
405000701_11_
We helped, but Yuna's song buff
was the MVP today.
Asuna
405000701_9_
Kirito
405000701_10_
Seven
405000701_8_
We managed to take out all the
bad guys because of you.
Rain
405000701_7_
Seven
405000701_6_
Thanks for the help, guys.
Rain
405000701_5_
Kirito
405000701_4_
Looks like it.
Asuna
405000701_3_
Asuna
405000701_2_
bg_event_swimming_pool
That's the last one.
This area's clear.
Kirito
405000701_1_
Hehe, really?
I never told you?
Seven
405000601_70_
Seven
405000601_69_
Wow...
I didn't know that...
Rain
405000601_68_
Kirito
405000601_67_
You don't mean...
Could she be...?
Asuna
405000601_66_
Rain
405000601_65_
Her songs gave hope back to those
who knew nothing but despair. She
inspired me to become an idol.
Seven
405000601_64_
Rain
405000601_63_
Yeah. She traveled through SAO,
singing songs to bring courage and
cheer.
Seven
405000601_62_
Asuna
405000601_61_
Aincrad's songstress?
Kirito
405000601_60_
Rain
405000601_59_
I came across a description
of a girl known as "Aincrad's
songstress."
Seven
405000601_58_
See, when I started looking into
what had happened in SAO...
Seven
405000601_57_
But there's another reason I
decided to become a VRMMO
idol.
Seven
405000601_56_
But I've always enjoyed it.
I remember singing with Rain when
I was really, really little...
Seven
405000601_55_
I started singing in ALO for my
own research.
Seven
405000601_54_
What's wrong?
Rain
405000601_53_
...
Seven
405000601_52_
Rain
405000601_51_
W-Well...
Seven
405000601_50_
Kirito
405000601_49_
You were staring at Yuna's concert
like you REALLY wanted to go...
Asuna
405000601_48_
Kirito
405000601_47_
Ahaha, I get that!
But still...
Asuna
405000601_46_
Rain
405000601_45_
Even if liked her music, seeing her
concert would be supporting the
enemy, and I won't do that!
Seven
405000601_44_
Maybe you forgot, but I'm a VRMMO
idol. AR idols are competition,
pure and simple.
Seven
405000601_43_
Rain
405000601_42_
That's part of it, but not the only
reason I avoided the concert.
Seven
405000601_41_
Asuna
405000601_40_
You go from being a noob to a
veteran, and it feels amazing.
Kirito
405000601_39_
In any game, there's that awesome
moment when you realize you just
started getting good.
Kirito
405000601_38_
Asuna
405000601_37_
Ha ha, I get it. You just hit that
sweet spot.
Kirito
405000601_36_
Seven
405000601_35_
Maybe we're late to the party,
but we've just started to really
get into it!
Rain
405000601_34_
I guess...Seven and I started OS
after everyone, right?
Rain
405000601_33_
Seven
405000601_32_
Hahaha. We didn't know it was
Yuna up there, but we did pick
OS over a mysterious concert.
Rain
405000601_31_
Kirito
405000601_30_
Hey, question! You two like Yuna
too, right? Don't you want to
see her concert?
Asuna
405000601_29_
Seven
405000601_28_
I guess everyone would eventually
notice the OS buff once her
concert started...
Rain
405000601_27_
Seven
405000601_26_
Hmm... People have gotten
buffs from Yuna's event battles
too, right?
Rain
405000601_25_
Asuna
405000601_24_
Sugu's still over there, and I
doubt I could drag her away
if I tried...
Kirito
405000601_23_
Asuna
405000601_22_
Yeah, especially when you're as
popular as Yuna. Everyone's sure
to rush over to see her...
Kirito
405000601_21_
Rain
405000601_20_
But that's so mean! Who would
notice monsters spawning when
you're enjoying a concert!
Seven
405000601_19_
Kirito
405000601_18_
That way, this place has a whole
extra layer of fun to it.
Asuna
405000601_17_
That makes sense. They
custom-built this event for
OS players and Yuna fans.
Asuna
405000601_16_
Was linked to this hunt quest
all along!
Kirito
405000601_15_
Yeah. Which means that Yuna's
surprise concert...
Kirito
405000601_14_
Kirito
405000601_13_
So Yuna's buff just happens to be
super effective against these
monsters? Suspicious.
Asuna
405000601_12_
Seven
405000601_11_
Totally! This buff is ridiculous!
And it's giving us special bonuses
against these monsters, too!
Rain
405000601_10_
Asuna
405000601_9_
Whoa, Yuna's buff is
really that strong?!
Kirito
405000601_8_
Seven
405000601_7_
We can do this!
Rain
405000601_6_
You bet! And their attacks don't
hurt half as much anymore!
Rain
405000601_5_
It definitely felt that one, Rain!
Seven
405000601_4_
Graaawr!
Monster
405000601_3_
Seven
405000601_2_
bg_event_swimming_pool
Take THAT!!
Rain
405000601_1_
Rain
405000501_26_
Yeah, of course!
Seven
405000501_25_
Asuna
405000501_24_
Well, this sounds like a lot of
fun. Mind filling us in on the
details?
Kirito
405000501_23_
Seven
405000501_22_
I think we might just stand a
chance against those OP monsters!
Rain
405000501_21_
I do!
With Yuna's buff...
Rain
405000501_20_
Just a single shot took out almost
all of our HP too... Hold up, Rain!
You don't think...?
Seven
405000501_19_
Rain
405000501_18_
Those OS monsters back there had
STR and DEF stats off the charts...
Seven
405000501_17_
Kirito
405000501_16_
That's right. Her songs raise
a bunch of stats.
Asuna
405000501_15_
Rain
405000501_14_
It does?!
Seven
405000501_13_
Doesn't her music give you some
kind of massive buff in OS?
Rain
405000501_12_
Seven
405000501_11_
Cool...
Wait, hold on a sec...
Rain
405000501_10_
Asuna
405000501_9_
Yeah. She's putting on a
surprise concert.
Kirito
405000501_8_
Seven
405000501_7_
Yuna's an AR idol in OS, right?
Rain
405000501_6_
Rain
405000501_5_
Ahh, I was wondering what
all the fuss was about.
Seven
405000501_4_
Yuna
405000501_3_
WOOOOOOOOO!
Crowd
405000501_2_
bg_event_swimming_pool
Well, this is it, everyone! The
final countdown! Let's do it!
Yuna
405000501_1_
Asuna
405000401_63_
You'll never believe it, but...
Kirito
405000401_62_
Rain
405000401_61_
So, changing the subject, what's
going on at that stage over there?
Seven
405000401_60_
Asuna
405000401_59_
That's interesting...
Kirito
405000401_58_
Rain
405000401_57_
Yeah...
Over in that pool...
Seven
405000401_56_
Asuna
405000401_55_
Really?
Monsters spawn here?
Kirito
405000401_54_
Seven
405000401_53_
N-No, of course not!
We just...got our butts
kicked in an OS battle...
Rain
405000401_52_
Kirito
405000401_51_
Did you almost drown or
something?!
Asuna
405000401_50_
Kirito
405000401_49_
Forget us! What's going on?!
You guys look terrible!
Asuna
405000401_48_
Rain
405000401_47_
Well, isn't this just a
big coincidence.
Seven
405000401_46_
Seven
405000401_45_
Huh? K-Kirito?!
What are you doing here?
Rain
405000401_44_
Asuna
405000401_43_
What the -?!
Rain?! Seven?!
Kirito
405000401_42_
Huh?
Kirito
405000401_41_
Nngh...
???
405000401_40_
Ha ha. Yeah, a bit...
Kirito
405000401_39_
Hehe, you're sleepy from staying
up all night, aren't you?
Asuna
405000401_38_
Asuna
405000401_37_
Wow, everyone's really fired up...
Kirito
405000401_36_
Yuna
405000401_36_1
WOOOOOOOO!!!
Crowd
405000401_35_
I know, I know! But let's make
every last song count, okay?!
Yuna
405000401_34_
Suguha
405000401_33_
Silica
405000401_32_
We want more!!
Liz
405000401_31_
But we just got here!
Suguha
405000401_30_
Liz
405000401_29_
Suguha
405000401_28_
Aww...
Silica
405000401_27_
Yuna
405000401_26_
Whaaat?! No way!
Crowd
405000401_25_
We've only got a few songs left,
so be sure to stick around!
Yuna
405000401_24_
I'm really glad to see so many
fans here today, even though we
didn't make an announcement!
Yuna
405000401_23_
Sinon
405000401_22_
Asuna
405000401_21_
Great. Thanks, Sinon.
Kirito
405000401_20_
Have fun. I'll grab Liz and the
gang and come find you when
this is over.
Sinon
405000401_19_
Oh, that sounds great.
I'll go with you.
Asuna
405000401_18_
Good point... Cool, well, I'm going
to go sit down for a minute.
Kirito
405000401_17_
And once it is, we'll still have
lots of time to go swimming.
Sinon
405000401_16_
It's just a mini-concert.
It'll be over in a flash.
Sinon
405000401_15_
Ha ha... But I'm feeling guilty.
We came all the way out here
and aren't even using the pool...
Kirito
405000401_14_
Sinon
405000401_13_
Kirito
405000401_12_
Hehe, everyone's having so much
fun! This blazing heat won't beat
us!
Asuna
405000401_11_
Silica
405000401_9_
We love you!
Liz
405000401_8_
Suguha
405000401_10_
Yuna!
Suguha
405000401_7_
Liz
405000401_6_
Suguha
405000401_5_
YEAAAAAAH!!
Silica
405000401_4_
Yuna
405000401_3_
YEAAAAAAH!!
Crowd
405000401_2_
bg_event_swimming_pool
Is everyone having fun out there?!
Yuna
405000401_1_
Hehe. Sure, sure.
Rain
405000301_22_
H-Hey, I'm not obsessed! I just
like it a lot, that's all! Besides,
I only play a little bit!
Seven
405000301_21_
You've been playing non-stop since
Kirito and the others asked us
to play with them.
Rain
405000301_20_
Hehe, you're seriously obsessed
with OS, aren't you?
Rain
405000301_19_
Who cares about the show!
We've got OS rankings to climb!
Seven
405000301_18_
Are you sure? Don't you want to
know who's playing on stage?
Rain
405000301_17_
But that's fine by me! Let's take
them down and hoard all those
juicy points for ourselves!
Seven
405000301_16_
That must be why no one's over
here, even though a bunch of OS
monsters spawned...
Seven
405000301_15_
Well, look at that. I guess there's
going to be some sort of show?
Or maybe a mini-concert?
Seven
405000301_14_
You see that stage over there?
A lot of people are starting to
gather around it...
Rain
405000301_13_
Are you okay? You've been staring
at something for a good minute
now...
Seven
405000301_12_
Whoa, there is!
And it looks really tough...
Rain
405000301_11_
I said there's a monster over
there! Weren't you listening?!
Seven
405000301_10_
Oh, sorry!
What were you saying?
Rain
405000301_9_
Rain? Is something wrong?
Seven
405000301_8_
...
Rain
405000301_7_
I thought something was fishy!
I remember seeing this place
listed as an official OS sponsor.
Seven
405000301_6_
So this pool really was turned
into an OS stage!
Seven
405000301_5_
...
Rain
405000301_4_
There's a monster by that building
at the edge of the pool! A DBA!
Seven
405000301_3_
Rain
405000301_2_
bg_event_swimming_pool
Rain! Look, over there!
Seven
405000301_1_
Yeah!
Suguha
405000201_46_
Suguha
405000201_45_
Kirito
405000201_44_
Alright, let's start up OS!
Asuna
405000201_43_
Shino
405000201_42_
Rika
405000201_41_
Y-Yeah, of course!
Keiko
405000201_40_
Did everyone bring their Augmas?
Rika
405000201_39_
If Yuna's actually having a
concert here today, we HAVE
to see it!
Rika
405000201_38_
Keiko
405000201_37_
Rika
405000201_36_
You're one to talk...
Shino
405000201_35_
Suguha
405000201_34_
Asuna
405000201_33_
I thought the info was pretty well
hidden, but I guess some people
out there are just obsessed.
Kirito
405000201_32_
Perhaps, perhaps. I'm sure at
least a few people besides me
figured it out.
Kirito
405000201_31_
Suguha
405000201_30_
Kirito
405000201_29_
Whoa! Hmm, I wonder if that's why
this place is so crowded today...
Asuna
405000201_28_
Shino
405000201_27_
Rika
405000201_26_
Y-Yuna?! Seriously?!
Keiko
405000201_25_
Suguha
405000201_24_
Asuna
405000201_23_
Ready to have your mind blown?!
Yuna's throwing a surprise concert!
Kirito
405000201_22_
Shino
405000201_21_
Keiko
405000201_20_
That sounds cool.
So, what's the deal?
Rika
405000201_19_
Suguha
405000201_18_
Asuna
405000201_17_
Heh, only part of the reason.
Anyway, a rumor site got their
hands on this exclusive leak.
Kirito
405000201_16_
Waaait a sec, is that what you
were poking about on the internet
last night?
Suguha
405000201_15_
Like, here here?!
Really?!
Suguha
405000201_14_
There's gonna be an
OS event here today!
Kirito
405000201_13_
Suguha
405000201_12_
Asuna
405000201_11_
Get ready to have your minds
blown! According to my sources...
Kirito
405000201_10_
Rika
405000201_9_
Keiko
405000201_8_
Why are you wearing your Augma?
And why is it turned on?
Shino
405000201_7_
Suguha
405000201_6_
Kirito
405000201_5_
Y-You do?
Asuna
405000201_4_
Suguha
405000201_3_
Asuna
405000201_2_
bg_event_swimming_pool
I have a confession to make!
Kirito
405000201_1_
Yeah, let's go!
Keiko
405000101_46_
Rika
405000101_45_
Keiko
405000101_44_
Anyway, let's get moving.
It'll take forever just to get in
and change if it gets crowded.
Shino
405000101_43_
Asuna
405000101_42_
Suguha
405000101_41_
S-Sorry...
I'll be good...
Kazuto
405000101_40_
You know it's unhealthy to
stay up that late, Kirito!
Asuna
405000101_39_
It was 3 AM.
Suguha
405000101_38_
I woke up in the middle of the
night and heard you typing,
Kirito.
Suguha
405000101_37_
Asuna
405000101_36_
Suguha
405000101_35_
I, uh...started messing around
on the Net after that, I guess...
Kazuto
405000101_34_
Shino
405000101_33_
Keiko
405000101_32_
Oh really? I remember seeing
you logged into ALO way after
the stroke of midnight.
Rika
405000101_31_
Asuna
405000101_30_
Suguha
405000101_29_
And ended up staying up half
the night reading them...
Kazuto
405000101_28_
Err... I kinda found a bunch of
really cool articles while I was
surfing the Net...
Kazuto
405000101_27_
Kirito? Is this true?
Asuna
405000101_26_
You were up super late too,
weren't you, Mr. Responsible?
Suguha
405000101_25_
Look at you, trying to act all
grown up. But I heard you
puttering around all last night.
Suguha
405000101_24_
Ha ha, good point. Let's have fun,
but let's do it responsibly, okay?
Kazuto
405000101_23_
Asuna
405000101_22_
Kazuto
405000101_21_
And it's easy to forget when
surrounded by the stuff, but
make sure to drink lots of water.
Suguha
405000101_20_
Shino
405000101_19_
Rika
405000101_18_
R-Right, I'll be extra careful!
Keiko
405000101_17_
Liz is right. I don't want you
getting exhausted and passing
out or anything, got it?
Shino
405000101_16_
Water park or not, we're still
going to be running around a lot.
Don't push yourself too hard.
Rika
405000101_15_
Whoa, seriously?
Are you gonna be okay, Silica?
Rika
405000101_14_
Shino
405000101_13_
Rika
405000101_12_
Hehe, this is going to be so much
fun! I was so excited I barely
slept last night!
Keiko
405000101_11_
Yup, we're all ready.
Asuna
405000101_10_
Asuna
405000101_9_
Suguha
405000101_8_
Is everyone here?
Kazuto
405000101_7_
Hey, look.
I think I found everyone.
Kazuto
405000101_6_
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Suguha
405000101_5_
Besides, even the wave pool is
probably pretty shallow. It's not
like you'll be swimming laps.
Kazuto
405000101_4_
Oh, don't pout. It's a water park.
We're going to have fun,
not master the butterfly stroke.
Kazuto
405000101_3_
Kazuto
405000101_2_
bg_os_town_1
sigh
...
Why is swimming so hard?
Suguha
405000101_1_a
Eugeo
404801201_65_a
Yeah.
Kirito
404801201_64_a
Asuna
404801201_63_a
Alice
404801201_62_a
Then it sounds like we're all in
favor of staying here for a bit
before heading back.
Yuuki
404801201_61_a
Asuna
404801201_60_a
Yuuki
404801201_59_a
Very well. There is nothing to be
done until Amayori recovers,
after all.
Alice
404801201_58_a
Kirito
404801201_57_a
I agree. Alice...?
Eugeo
404801201_56_a
All this non-stop questing and
battling takes its toll on you.
Kirito
404801201_55_a
Eugeo
404801201_54_a
I think we could all use a bit
of downtime there.
Kirito
404801201_53_a
Alice
404801201_52_a
Yuuki
404801201_51_a
Of course!
Asuna
404801201_50_a
I would like to let her rest a
while. May we return to that
village on the beach?
Alice
404801201_49_a
Some animals ARE adversely
affected by salt water...
Yuuki
404801201_48_a
Asuna
404801201_47_a
Yuuki
404801201_46_a
No... Perhaps she cannot withstand
being in this "ocean" after all...
Alice
404801201_45_a
Eugeo
404801201_44_a
Is it from being out in the sun
too long...?
Kirito
404801201_43_a
Asuna
404801201_42_a
Yuuki
404801201_41_a
Amayori is acting strangely...
Alice
404801201_40_a
What's wrong, Alice?
Asuna
404801201_39_a
...!
Alice
404801201_38_a
Grrauu...
Amayori
404801201_37_a
bg_event_seashore
We've returned, Amayori...
Alice
404801201_36_a
Hehe...
Alice
404801201_35_a
Ggruuuruu!
Dolphin
404801201_34_a
You have my thanks. Without you,
we might never have found the
Divine Object.
Alice

Alice
404801201_30_a
Kirito

I think this little one is bidding
farewell to you, Alice.

Asuna
404801201_23_a
Yuuki
404801201_22_a
Yes. Amayori is waiting for us.
Alice
404801201_21_a
Eugeo
404801201_20_a
Let's head back to the surface
for now.
Kirito
404801201_19_a
Alice
404801201_18_a
Asuna
404801201_17_a
Now we finally got what we came
here for!
Yuuki

Hehe, dolphins are very clever,

404801201_12_a
I wonder if it did so in order to
thank us for restoring peace to
its home...
Eugeo
404801201_11_a
Ha ha, it was trying to tell us
where to find the Object!
Kirito
404801201_9_a
Eugeo
404801201_10_a
Alice
404801201_8_a

Yuuki
404801201_6_a
Ggrruu!
Dolphin
404801201_5_a
Then that means...
Alice
404801201_4_a
Alice
404801201_3_a
item_event_sacred_treasure
So it just got buried under all
this sand!
Asuna
404801201_2_a
bg_event_deep_sea
Hellooooo Divine Object!
Yuuki
404801201_1_a
Only one way to find out!
Kirito
404801101_47_a
You don't think...?!
Eugeo
404801101_46_a
Eugeo
404801101_45_a
I think that dolphin wants us to
follow it somewhere.
Kirito
404801101_44_a
Alice
404801101_43_a
Yuuki
404801101_42_a
Kirito!
Asuna
404801101_41_a
Eugeo
404801101_40_a
Or...maybe not...
Kirito
404801101_39_a
Asuna
404801101_38_a
Yuuki
404801101_37_a
Ah, s-stop that! You little-!
Don't pull that!
Alice
404801101_36_a
Eugeo
404801101_35_a
Kirito
404801101_34_a
Ggrruu!
Dolphin
404801101_33_a
Maybe that's its way of thanking
us for getting rid of the whale.
Kirito
404801101_32_a
Eugeo
404801101_31_a
Ha ha, like I said, it's not a
fish. These little guys are
supposedly really clever.
Kirito
404801101_30_a
Asuna
404801101_29_a
Yuuki
404801101_28_a
Wh-Why is this fish making
dragon noises...?
Alice
404801101_27_a
Ggruu... Ggrouuuh!
Dolphin
404801101_26_a
Alice
404801101_25_a
Yuuki
404801101_24_a
Looks like it. That's a relief...
Asuna
404801101_23_a
Eugeo
404801101_22_a
That whale may have disrupted this
ecosystem, but now that it's gone,
things are returning to normal.
Kirito
404801101_21_a
Alice
404801101_20_a
Asuna
404801101_19_a
I can see some crabs and other
tiny creatures on the ocean floor!
Yuuki
404801101_18_a
Alice
404801101_17_a
Yuuki
404801101_16_a
And there's a school of
little fish too!
Asuna
404801101_15_a
Eugeo
404801101_14_a
It's not a fish. It's a dolphin!
Kirito
404801101_13_a
Kirito
404801101_12_a
What kind of fish is that?
Eugeo
404801101_11_a
Yuuki
404801101_9_a
Oh! Everyone, look!
Asuna
404801101_8_a
Alice
404801101_10_a
But Leviathan's gone now...
Yuuki
404801101_7_a
Then it must have devoured
every last creature here...
Alice
404801101_6_a
Asuna
404801101_5_a
Yuuki
404801101_4_a
Well, if that "whale" used this
place as its feeding ground...
Alice
404801101_3_a
Eugeo
404801101_2_a
bg_event_deep_sea
This place sure is deserted...
Kirito
404801101_1_a
Ggrruu!
Amayori
404801001_42_a
Amayori, you wait here.
Alice
404801001_41_a
Very well. I am not that adept at
swimming, but we must do what
is required of us.
Alice
404801001_40_a
Asuna
404801001_39_a
Alice
404801001_38_a
Yeah! Plus, we're already in our
suits, so I wanna swim some more!
Yuuki
404801001_37_a
Eugeo
404801001_36_a
We should search the ocean floor
around here, since this is where
it was swimming last.
Kirito
404801001_35_a
Eugeo
404801001_34_a
S-Sorry...
Anyway!
Kirito
404801001_33_a
Alice
404801001_32_a
Yuuki
404801001_31_a
You don't have to be so gross!
Asuna
404801001_30_a
Alice
404801001_29_a
Yuuki
404801001_28_a
Ugh, will you two stop!
Asuna
404801001_27_a
Kirito
404801001_26_a
You're right. A beast that size
must produce a TON of waste.
Eugeo
404801001_25_a
It'd probably sink to the bottom
of the ocean along with, you know,
all that other crap.
Kirito
404801001_24_a
Eugeo
404801001_23_a
Still, imagine how much that whale
can eat. A load that big wouldn't
float to the surface.
Kirito
404801001_22_a
Asuna
404801001_21_a
Alice
404801001_20_a
Ahahaha, that's true... But I
reaaaally don't want to think
about that...
Yuuki
404801001_19_a
Kirito
404801001_18_a
But if it won't be digested, that
means there's a chance it will
be...excreted.
Eugeo
404801001_17_a
Eugeo
404801001_16_a
Doubtful. It's a Divine Object,
after all. It ought to be able to
stand up to worse than some acid.
Kirito
404801001_15_a
Yuuki
404801001_14_a
Asuna
404801001_13_a
Perhaps it was digested...
Alice
404801001_12_a
Eugeo
404801001_11_a
No...
Kirito
404801001_10_a
Yuuki
404801001_9_a
Alice
404801001_8_a
You didn't see it inside
Leviathan's stomach?
Asuna
404801001_7_a
Kirito
404801001_6_a
That is true. Still, it is a shame
we lost the Divine Object...
Eugeo
404801001_5_a
Oh, uh, just that we'll be much
cooler in these clothes.
Kirito
404801001_4_a
What do you mean?
Eugeo
404801001_3_a
Eugeo
404801001_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Alright, now we're dressed for
summer too!
Kirito
404801001_1_a
Asuna
404800901_51_a
Yuuki
404800901_50_a
That is not the issue at hand!
Just hurry and cover yourself!
Alice
404800901_49_a
Eugeo
404800901_48_a
Who're you calling scrawny?
I think I look pretty good, all
things considered...
Kirito
404800901_47_a
Asuna
404800901_46_a
Yuuki
404800901_45_a
You are indecent! Find something
to cover those...those scrawny
bodies with immediately!
Alice
404800901_44_a
Kirito
404800901_43_a
Oh, you're right... It was the
whale's gastric acid, it ate right
through them.
Eugeo
404800901_42_a
Gaaaaaaah!
C-Crap!
Kirito
404800901_41_a
Kirito
404800901_40_a
Huh?
Eugeo
404800901_39_a
Asuna
404800901_38_a
Alice
404800901_37_a
Well, your clothes are like...
pretty much gone, you know.
Yuuki
404800901_36_a
Eugeo
404800901_35_a
M-Makes sense... But why did Alice
look at us and freak out?
Kirito
404800901_34_a
Yuuki
404800901_33_a
Alice
404800901_32_a
Ahaha...
Asuna
404800901_31_a
We changed into our swimsuits!
Yuuki
404800901_30_a
Asuna
404800901_29_a
Alice
404800901_28_a
Ehehe, well, they were super hot
and hard to move in, and no good
for underwater fighting, so...
Yuuki
404800901_27_a
Kirito
404800901_26_a
Wh-What happened
to your clothes...?
Eugeo
404800901_25_a
Eugeo
404800901_24_a
What's wrong? Why are you...
Ah-aaah!
Kirito
404800901_23_a
Asuna
404800901_22_a
Yuuki
404800901_21_a
Wah-waaaahhhh!
Alice
404800901_20_a
Asuna
404800901_19_a
Yuuki
404800901_18_a
That takes care of one problem...
Alice
404800901_17_a
Eugeo
404800901_16_a
It's Asuna and the others!!
Kirito
404800901_15_a
Alice
404800901_14_a
Yuuki
404800901_13_a
Kirito!
Asuna
404800901_12_a
Eugeo
404800901_11_a
Hahaha, too true.
Kirito
404800901_10_a
Even had we known, I doubt any of
us would have volunteered to be
eaten alive.
Eugeo
404800901_9_a
was to coordinate attacks from
within and without at the same
time.
Kirito
404800901_8_a
Yeah. Geez, I never would have
guessed that the only way to
defeat this thing
Kirito
404800901_7_a
Ahh... There's no better feeling
than having cheated death.
Eugeo
404800901_6_a
Eugeo
404800901_5_a

We're free!

Graaaaaaoooooh!
Whale
404800901_1_a
...!
Eugeo
404800801_23_a
So we were supposed to get stuck
in here as part of the game...
Kirito
404800801_22_a
Let's see...
Ah, okay...
Kirito
404800801_21_a
Excellent news! How?
Eugeo
404800801_20_a
And she's found a way
to defeat it!
Kirito
404800801_19_a
She says she's found the whale...
Whoa!
Kirito
404800801_18_a
That is a useful skill indeed...
Eugeo
404800801_17_a
Oh, uh... Our magic allows us
to contact each other if we're
close by.
Kirito
404800801_16_a
What do you mean?
Eugeo
404800801_15_a
Huh? Asuna just sent me a
message...
Kirito
404800801_14_a
No time, and no way out...
No way...
Kirito
404800801_13_a
It seems quite thick...
Eugeo
404800801_12_a
bg_event_inside_whale
What the...?!
I didn't even scratch it!
Kirito
404800801_11_a
bg_black
RRRAAAAHHH!
Kirito
404800801_10_a
Dammit...! Then we're just going
to have to bust our way out of
here!
Kirito
404800801_9_a
Looks like we're out of time...
Eugeo
404800801_8_a
It's gastric acid! Don't let it
touch you or it'll eat through
your equipment!
Kirito
404800801_7_a
Kirito!
Your clothes-!
Eugeo
404800801_6_a
Aaagghhh!
Kirito
404800801_5_a
Ah, crap...!
Kirito
404800801_4_a
Kirito, look! There's some sort of
fluid being secreted from that
wall!
Eugeo
404800801_3_a
Eugeo
404800801_2_a
bg_event_inside_whale
Alright! Just a few more monsters
and we're done!
Kirito
404800801_1_a
I'm ready!
Eugeo
404800701_20_a
Could be... In any case, looks
like we need to fight our way
through them, Eugeo!
Kirito
404800701_19_a
Maybe the beast keeps them inside
itself to take care of the living
prey it ingests?
Eugeo
404800701_18_a
Wh-What the hell are those?!
How are there monsters
INSIDE a monster?!
Kirito
404800701_17_a
GRAAWRGH!!
???
404800701_16_a
Eugeo...
Kirito
404800701_15_a
Oh... Indeed I am. Strange...
Your presence must be a balm
for my nerves.
Eugeo
404800701_14_a
Ha ha, I could say the same for
you, Eugeo. You're pretty calm.
Kirito
404800701_13_a
Considering our situation, you
don't seem too perturbed.
Eugeo
404800701_12_a
Yeah.
Kirito
404800701_11_a
You're right. If we stay here,
we'll end up getting digested...
Eugeo
404800701_10_a
Ha ha, we can be impressed once
we get out of here.
Kirito
404800701_9_a
Amazing... To think we had the
privilege of seeing it with our
own eyes...
Eugeo
404800701_8_a
It is pretty incredible. I think
it's probably the largest animal
in the entire world.
Kirito
404800701_7_a
I can't believe something like
that dwells in Alfheim's seas...
Eugeo
404800701_6_a
You mean that giant fish?
I've never seen such a massive
creature before.
Eugeo
404800701_5_a
Yeah. Seems like we're in the
whale's stomach.
Kirito
404800701_4_a
Are we...alive?
Eugeo
404800701_3_a
Kirito
404800701_2_a
bg_event_inside_whale
...
Eugeo
404800701_1_a
You got it. Let's change into our
swimsuits and go back to where
we first saw that thing!
Yuuki
404800601_22_a
Tell us on the way. Time is of
the essence.
Alice
404800601_21_a
That's great news! What do we
have to do?
Asuna
404800601_20_a
Absolutely! Luckily the villagers
told me there's a way to take
that whale down!
Yuuki
404800601_19_a
A legendary monster is no foe to
be taken lightly...
Alice
404800601_18_a
Um, yes... But people have
speculated that it was inspired
by real-life sperm whales.
Asuna
404800601_17_a
Is that one of this world's myths?
Alice
404800601_16_a
Leviathan is a monster from the
Old Testament, isn't it?
Asuna
404800601_15_a
The poor fishermen don't know what
to do.
Yuuki
404800601_14_a
They say that whale is called
Leviathan, and it's been
terrorizing these waters lately.
Yuuki
404800601_13_a
I just spoke with some of those
villagers.
Yuuki
404800601_12_a
Alice
404800601_11_a
Hey, Yuuki's back!
Asuna
404800601_10_a
Asuna! Alice!
Yuuki
404800601_9_a
Alice
404800601_8_a
Alright! Then let's go save the
boys and find that Object!
Asuna
404800601_7_a
No need to apologize. This is what
I must do to fulfill my duties, so
I do not mind.
Alice
404800601_6_a
Yeah, sorry... That's all I had
that would fit you.
Asuna
404800601_5_a
But there is such little fabric...
Alice
404800601_4_a
It is quite cool and comfortable.
I should be able to swim more
easily now, as well.
Alice
404800601_3_a
How does it feel, Alice?
Asuna
404800601_2_a
bg_event_seashore
...
Alice
404800601_1_a
What is it, Alice?
Asuna
404800501_19_a
Understood. But before that,
I have a proposal for you two...
Alice
404800501_18_a
Exactly! So we can't abandon hope
just yet. We've got work to do!
Yuuki
404800501_17_a
Ahh, indeed... Then those two are
somehow still alive in the belly
of that "whale" creature.
Alice
404800501_16_a
See, if I do this, then we can see
how Kirito and Eugeo are doing...
Asuna
404800501_15_a
Ummm, well, we're friends, so we
can see their status-I mean, we
can use a Stacia Window to check.
Asuna
404800501_14_a
What...?
Alice
404800501_13_a
Don't worry, those two are
totally still alive!
Yuuki
404800501_12_a
How can you be so calm, Asuna?
Our comrades have been devoured...
Alice
404800501_11_a
It's not your fault, Alice! No one
could have predicted we'd be
attacked by a giant whale.
Asuna
404800501_10_a
It is obvious that I am the one
who caused us to fail...
Alice
404800501_9_a
I am a poor swimmer to begin with,
and my armor is only dragging me
down...
Alice
404800501_8_a
I am to blame...
Alice
404800501_7_a
And to make matters worse, we
lost sight of the Object... Maybe it
was eaten too...
Asuna
404800501_6_a
We lost it... Guess there really
wasn't any way we could keep
up with its speed...

Alice, wait, let me cast my spell
first so we can breathe...!
Asuna
404800401_50_a
After it!
Alice
404800401_49_a
Oh no, it's diving!!
Yuuki
404800401_48_a
GRAAAAAAAHHHH!
Whale
404800401_47_a
Yuuki
404800401_46_a
O-Okay!
Asuna
404800401_45_a
If we hit it hard enough, we
might be able to make it spit
them back up!
Alice
404800401_44_a
Don't just stand there! We have to
fight this monstrosity!
Alice
404800401_43_a
Asuna
404800401_42_a
That thing ate Kirito and Eugeo!!
Yuuki

Oh no...!

Kirito!!!
Asuna
404800401_35_a
Eugeo

Dammit, how is it reacting to
our movements so well?
Kirito
404800401_33_a
What the-?!
Eugeo

Grraaagh!!

404800401_23_a
Kirito, you attack it from its
right flank!
Eugeo
404800401_22_a
Yuuki
404800401_21_a
Asuna
404800401_20_a
Tch... We have to do something!
Kirito
404800401_19_a
Yuuki
404800401_18_a
Kirito
404800401_17_a
That whale's HUGE!
It's gotta be a monster!
Asuna
404800401_16_a
Alice
404800401_15_a
Eugeo
404800401_14_a
GRAAAAOOHHHH!!
???
404800401_13_a
Wha-?!
Alice
404800401_12_a
Alice
404800401_11_a
Alice! Watch your back! Something
big is approaching!
Eugeo
404800401_10_a
Yuuki
404800401_9_a
Asuna
404800401_8_a
Huh...? What's that shadow
beneath the surface?!
Kirito
404800401_7_a
Eugeo
404800401_6_a
Alice
404800401_5_a
Grauu!
Amayori
404800401_4_a
Eugeo
404800401_3_a
Amayori
404800401_2_a
bg_event_sky_and_sea
Good, now get closer
to the water...
Alice
404800401_1_a
Gauuuuu!!
Amayori
404800301_41_a
Eugeo
404800301_40_a
Onward, Amayori!
Alice
404800301_39_a
Yuuki
404800301_38_a
Asuna
404800301_37_a
Looks like we'll get that vacation
after all!
Kirito
404800301_36_a
Alice
404800301_35_a
item_event_sacred_treasure
That's the Object we saw in the
painting! I can't believe we found
it so quickly!
Eugeo
404800301_34_a
Asuna
404800301_33_a
Kirito
404800301_32_a
Hehe, that's a great idea!
Oh, hey, look!!
Yuuki
404800301_31_a
Y-Yeah, once we find the Object,
it could be nice to stay a little
longer for some R 'n' R.
Kirito
404800301_30_a
Still, it would be nice to have a
little vacation with everyone
since we're here and all.
Asuna
404800301_29_a
M-My apologies...
Kirito
404800301_28_a
Kirito
404800301_27_a
Asuna
404800301_26_a
Ahaha, if looks could kill, you'd
be DEAD right now, Kirito!
Yuuki
404800301_25_a
Eugeo
404800301_24_a
...!
Alice
404800301_23_a
Yuuki
404800301_22_a
Asuna
404800301_21_a
Ah ha, so you WERE hot!
Kirito
404800301_20_a
Eugeo
404800301_19_a
Yes, which is why we will be wearing 
it regardless of how hot it gets.
Alice
404800301_18_a
Kirito
404800301_17_a
Yuuki
404800301_16_a
But that's what marks you as
Integrity Knights, right?
Asuna
404800301_15_a
Asuna
404800301_14_a
Kirito
404800301_13_a
That heavy armor you're wearing
probably doesn't help either, huh?
Yuuki
404800301_12_a
Alice
404800301_11_a
And to be honest...
it's REALLY hot.
Eugeo
404800301_10_a
Eugeo
404800301_9_a
W-Well, we are concentrating on
looking for the Divine Object.
Alice
404800301_8_a
Yuuki
404800301_7_a
Asuna
404800301_6_a
You two sure have gotten quiet...
Kirito
404800301_5_a
Eugeo
404800301_4_a
...
Alice
404800301_3_a
Alice
404800301_2_a
bg_event_sky_and_sea
...
Eugeo
404800301_1_a
Hehe, I'll just have to pick up
everybody else's slack!
Yuuki
404800201_29_a
Asuna
404800201_28_a
Yuuki
404800201_27_a
You may have been the only one
who could come today, but having
you here is a big help.
Kirito
404800201_26_a
Eugeo
404800201_25_a
You would make an excellent
knight with that sense of duty,
Yuuki.
Alice
404800201_24_a
Kirito
404800201_23_a
Asuna
404800201_22_a
Think happy thoughts!
Come on!
Yuuki
404800201_21_a
Turn those frowns upside down!
We'll never find that Object if we
keep up the gloomy attitude!
Yuuki
404800201_20_a
Ha ha, you never change, Yuuki...
Kirito
404800201_19_a
What's wrong, Asuna? You guys all
look miserable!
Yuuki
404800201_18_a
Thanks for the update, Yuuki...
Asuna
404800201_17_a
Hey guys!
Nothing over that way!
Yuuki
404800201_16_a
Kirito
404800201_15_a
Y-You're right...
Asuna
404800201_14_a
Eugeo
404800201_13_a
But we can see more from way up
here. Getting closer would make
our search more difficult.
Alice
404800201_12_a
Kirito
404800201_11_a
Maybe it'd be better if we flew
closer to the water...
Asuna
404800201_10_a
It could have something to do with
being closer to the sun.
Kirito
404800201_9_a
Asuna
404800201_8_a
No, I think it's just because
we're going south... And maybe
because we're flying.
Kirito
404800201_7_a
Alice
404800201_6_a
Are oceans always this sweltering?
Eugeo
404800201_5_a
Kirito
404800201_4_a
Well, it IS a tropical ocean...
Asuna
404800201_3_a
Asuna
404800201_2_a
bg_event_sky_and_sea
Ugh, it's so hot...
Kirito
404800201_1_a
Eugeo
404800101_41_a
...
Alice
404800101_40_a
Asuna
404800101_39_a
We want to help Urdr just as much
as you do.
Kirito
404800101_38_a
Asuna
404800101_37_a
E-Exactly! At least let us gather
everyone together before you go
rushing off.
Kirito
404800101_36_a
Eugeo
404800101_35_a
...
Alice
404800101_34_a
And you cannot ignore the fact
that we will find the Object much
faster by working together.
Eugeo
404800101_33_a
Alice
404800101_32_a
By that argument, I am 
in charge of this as well.
Eugeo
404800101_31_a
Asuna
404800101_30_a
But Alice...
Kirito
404800101_29_a
Eugeo
404800101_28_a
It would be unbecoming for a
knight to shirk her duties just
because they prove difficult.
Alice
404800101_27_a
Eugeo
404800101_26_a
I have Amayori. Besides, I alone am the one the goddess
entrusted with this errand.
Alice
404800101_25_a
Asuna
404800101_24_a
Don't be ridiculous! You and Eugeo
can't even fly!
Kirito
404800101_23_a
Eugeo
404800101_22_a
bg_11_home_veranda
I am departing for this "ocean"
immediately. Your assistance is
not required.
Alice
404800101_21_a
Kirito
404800101_20_a
What are you doing, Alice?!
Asuna
404800101_19_a
You're right. We're going to need
everyone's help with this...
Wait!
Asuna
404800101_18_a
...is going to be like finding a
needle in a haystack.
Kirito
404800101_17_a
Searching a vast ocean for this,
with no landmarks and no clues
except for this one picture...
Kirito
404800101_16_a
Asuna
404800101_15_a
I think it's the ocean at the
southernmost part of Salamander
territory.
Kirito
404800101_14_a
Eugeo
404800101_13_a
It must be another Divine Object.
This is the second we've found...
Please, tell us where this is.
Alice
404800101_12_a
Ah! Is that floating object
what I think it is?
Eugeo
404800101_11_a
An expanse of water as far as the
eye can see... This is what they
call the "ocean," is it not?
Eugeo
404800101_9_a
Alice
404800101_10_a
Kirito
404800101_8_a
Y-Yes, that!
Asuna
404800101_7_a
It's a painting that a fairy made
of something they saw.
Kirito
404800101_6_a
I-I mean, uh...
Asuna
404800101_5_a
Kirito
404800101_4_a
It's an image a player uploaded
to the internet...
Asuna
404800101_3_a
Eugeo
404800101_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
What is this?
Alice
404800101_1_a
Hehe, thanks, Kirito!
Yuuki
404601201_21_a
But, no problem, Yuuki.
I'll help you out again
whenever you need me to.
Kirito
404601201_20_a
We've created a monster...
Kirito
404601201_19_a
Hehe, you guys kept telling me
what a great dev I'd make, so
I've been looking into it...
Yuuki
404601201_18_a
Where the heck did you hear that?
Kirito
404601201_17_a
It's best if only one or two of
the devs themselves can actually
beat it!
Yuuki
404601201_16_a
Hehe, but you know, when it comes
to making games difficult...
Yuuki
404601201_15_a
Not to mention I don't think
anyone else has been able to
finish it since...
Kirito
404601201_14_a
What?! We worked our butts off
on that quest!
Kirito
404601201_13_a
You guys were able to get through
the last one no problem, so this
one's gonna be extra hard!
Yuuki
404601201_12_a
Well, this is so I have something
to enter right away the next time
they hold the competition!
Yuuki
404601201_11_a
But now that the contest is over,
there's no way for you to get it
released...
Kirito
404601201_10_a
Seriously?!
Kirito
404601201_9_a
These are for another quest
I was thinking of making...
Yuuki
404601201_8_a
That's not what I was asking!
Yuuki
404601201_7_a
This one's fantastic too! You
could open your own exhibit
with these.
Kirito
404601201_6_a
Whoa...
Amazing work as always...
Kirito
404601201_5_a
I just sketched up some concept
art. What do you think?
Yuuki
404601201_4_a
What's up, Yuuki?
Kirito
404601201_3_a
Kirito
404601201_2_a
bg_21_alne
Heeey, Kirito!
Yuuki
404601201_1_a
Asuna
404601101_35_a
Leafa
404601101_34_a
Ha ha, I hope she does!
Kirito
404601101_33_a
She's going to turn around and
scheme up even MORE devious
quests!
Siune
404601101_32_a
I think if we compliment her
any more...
Siune
404601101_31_a
Siune
404601101_30_a
Aww, you're just saying that...
Yuuki
404601101_29_a
Leafa
404601101_28_a
Yeah! You're a fantastic artist,
plus you seem really cut out
for that type of work.
Asuna
404601101_27_a
Asuna
404601101_26_a
Leafa
404601101_25_a
Totally. You could make a good
living as a game designer if you
wanted to, Yuuki.
Kirito
404601101_24_a
Siune
404601101_23_a
Hehe, thanks.
Yuuki
404601101_22_a
Leafa
404601101_21_a
But it was really fun since it was
different from all the quests we
normally do!
Asuna
404601101_20_a
Asuna
404601101_19_a
Kirito
404601101_18_a
sigh
...
It was definitely...unique.
Leafa
404601101_17_a
You've completed my quest.
Yuuki
404601101_16_a
Siune
404601101_15_a
You got it!
Congrats, guys!
Yuuki
404601101_14_a
Asuna
404601101_13_a
Leafa
404601101_12_a
Ha ha, then that means this was
the right way to handle things.
Kirito
404601101_11_a
I set it up so they'd go back on
their own once players defeated
the enemies.
Yuuki
404601101_10_a
Siune
404601101_9_a
Yep! Taking every single monster
you trained back to where you
found them would take forever.
Yuuki
404601101_8_a
Leafa
404601101_7_a
All the monsters we brought
are wandering off too...
Asuna
404601101_6_a
Phew... Finally beat them...
Kirito
404601101_5_a
Asuna
404601101_4_a
Leafa
404601101_3_a
Kirito
404601101_2_a
bg_03_forest1_sunset
Hnnggh...!
Hostile Cait Sith
404601101_1_a
Hehe, but it's not an IMPOSSIBLE
quest!
Yuuki
404601001_46_a
This is such a diabolical quest...
Siune
404601001_45_a
Siune
404601001_44_a
Hehe, nothing gets past those
guys... Looks like they already
figured this out.
Yuuki
404601001_43_a
Hahaha, clever!
Leafa
404601001_42_a
That's the idea! After all, we can
attack monsters all we want!
Kirito
404601001_41_a
Well, what happens if the Cait
Siths catch on and start taming
monsters of their own?
Leafa
404601001_40_a
Ahh, okay!
Asuna
404601001_39_a
or other monsters. The animals
will be safe and sound!
Kirito
404601001_38_a
Nope! The monsters we're training
will either aggro on us
Kirito
404601001_37_a
Won't it be just as bad when
the monsters start attacking
the animals?
Asuna
404601001_36_a
I know that'll make it nearly
impossible for them to capture
any animals, but still...
Asuna
404601001_35_a
But Kirito...
Asuna
404601001_34_a
Yeah! They'll never be able to
fight them all off!
Kirito
404601001_33_a
Asuna
404601001_32_a
Kirito
404601001_31_a
A-Are you sure it's okay to train
this many monsters, Kirito?!
Leafa
404601001_30_a
Wh-What the hell are all those
monsters doing here?!
Hostile Cait Sith
404601001_29_a
Graaarrgh!
Monster
404601001_28_a
Now, which one to grab first...?
Huh?
Hostile Cait Sith
404601001_27_a
These rare beasts are gonna sell
for a fortune and a half!
Hostile Cait Sith
404601001_26_a
Hahaha, we're in business now.
Hostile Cait Sith
404601001_25_a
Asuna
404601001_24_a
Leafa
404601001_22_a
Kirito
404601001_21_a
Take us there!
Kirito
404601001_20_a
Um... Yeah, there's this area in
Sylph territory that triggers hack
and slash quests all the time.
Leafa
404601001_19_a
Leafa, do you know if there's
anywhere nearby where a lot
of monsters spawn?
Kirito
404601001_18_a
It totally does!
Kirito
404601001_17_a
Knowing their motives doesn't get
us any closer to figuring out what
to do, though...
Leafa
404601001_16_a
Leafa
404601001_15_a
They're using the animals they've
tamed as a diversion so they can
capture others!
Asuna
404601001_14_a
So those guys must be...poachers!
Kirito
404601001_13_a
Oh! You're right! To the fairies,
these animals must be something
of a curiosity...
Kirito
404601001_12_a
Um... Well, the fairy realm has
never had an animal sanctuary like
this before, right?
Leafa
404601001_11_a
Wait a second, why did those Cait
Siths even show up here in the
first place?
Kirito
404601001_10_a
Yeah. What do we need to do...?
Kirito
404601001_9_a
No, that's not right... Yuuki must
have put in some way to get
around this...
Asuna
404601001_8_a
Well, we could always force our
way through the animals, even
though they'd get hurt...
Asuna
404601001_7_a
We can't attack those Cait Siths
like this!
Leafa
404601001_6_a
Dammit... How cruel do you have
to be to use animals as a shield?!
Kirito
404601001_5_a
Asuna
404601001_4_a
Leafa
404601001_3_a
Kirito
404601001_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Ha ha!
Sic 'em!
Hostile Cait Sith
404601001_1_a
R-Right!
Asuna
404600901_31_a
Leafa
404600901_30_a
Asuna
404600901_29_a
Anyway... Let's focus on stopping
those Cait Siths from hurting any
more animals!
Kirito
404600901_28_a
Hehehehe.
Yuuki
404600901_27_a
was a devil waiting to rear
her horns...
Siune
404600901_26_a
Who knew behind that angelic
facade of yours
Siune
404600901_25_a
It's just so much fun thinking of
all the different ways you can
antagonize the players!
Yuuki
404600901_24_a
Siune
404600901_23_a
Hehehe. I know exactly how the
devs' minds work...
Yuuki
404600901_22_a
Leafa
404600901_21_a
You just love to watch us suffer,
don't you, Yuuki...
Asuna
404600901_20_a
That's going to be a million
times more difficult!
Kirito
404600901_19_a
But now we're going to have to
protect the very animals that
are attacking us!
Kirito
404600901_18_a
It was pretty hard protecting the
animals from those monsters
earlier, remember?
Kirito
404600901_17_a
What do you mean?
Leafa
404600901_16_a
Leafa
404600901_15_a
Asuna
404600901_14_a
Right... I can tell that's going
to be easier said than done.
Kirito
404600901_13_a
This is the very last part of the
quest! You have to save the
animals from those Cait Siths!
Yuuki
404600901_12_a
Yuuki
404600901_11_a
What's going on, Yuuki?
Siune
404600901_10_a
Leafa
404600901_9_a
And they're using the animals
they've tamed to attack other
animals!
Kirito
404600901_8_a
They're taming the animals!
Leafa
404600901_7_a
Yeah... They look like Cait Siths.
I wonder what they're doing...
Oh!
Asuna
404600901_6_a
Huh? Are those NPCs?
Kirito
404600901_5_a
Leafa
404600901_4_a
Asuna
404600901_3_a
Kirito
404600901_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Ha ha! This'll come in handy!
Yuuki
404600901_1_a
Siune
404600801_44_a
Hehe, thanks, Leafa!
Yuuki
404600801_43_a
You took everything Kirito had
to teach you and ran with it to
create something really amazing!
Leafa
404600801_42_a
This sure is one heck of an
original quest...
Leafa
404600801_41_a
Leafa
404600801_40_a
Kirito
404600801_39_a
Hehe, you don't have to hide it
if you're embarrassed, Yuuki!
Asuna
404600801_38_a
Siune
404600801_37_a
My intentions weren't nearly as
grand as that, but I don't mind
if you interpret it that way, heh.
Yuuki
404600801_36_a
Leafa
404600801_35_a
Asuna
404600801_34_a
So you wanted to include a way for
people to learn about these sorts
of difficult things too.
Kirito
404600801_33_a
or never knowing how harsh
life really can be in the wild...
Yuuki
404600801_32_a
I feel like it's worse if you live
your whole life never having
seen animals at the zoo,
Yuuki
404600801_31_a
Sometimes bad things happen,
but we hardly ever get a chance
to really understand that.
Yuuki
404600801_30_a
Yeah... But you know, there are
limits to what we can do in life,
especially when we're kids...
Yuuki
404600801_29_a
That sounds like a catch-22
to me...
Siune
404600801_28_a
But if we don't, the buffalo
calves will die...
Siune
404600801_27_a
If we help the buffalo, then the
cheetahs will starve...
Siune
404600801_26_a
You did that because you wanted
players to choose, didn't you?
Siune
404600801_25_a
I included that in my design.
Yuuki
404600801_24_a
Siune
404600801_23_a
You taught me that that's part
and parcel of the way a monster
ecosystem works.
Yuuki
404600801_22_a
Leafa
404600801_21_a
Are you saying we should just let
the circle of life run its course?
Kirito
404600801_20_a
Leafa
404600801_19_a
Asuna
404600801_18_a
...!
Kirito
404600801_17_a
Siune
404600801_16_a
Well, we could intervene...
But would that normally
happen out in the wild?
Yuuki
404600801_15_a
We have to help them!
Leafa
404600801_14_a
Leafa
404600801_13_a
Kirito
404600801_12_a
Yuuki...?
Asuna
404600801_11_a
What do you want
to do about it, guys?
Yuuki
404600801_10_a
Siune
404600801_9_a
...
Yuuki
404600801_8_a
Leafa
404600801_7_a
The slowest members of the
herd are going to get eaten!
Kirito
404600801_6_a
Leafa
404600801_5_a
Asuna
404600801_4_a
Tch... There are newborn
calves in that herd!
Kirito
404600801_3_a
Yuuki
404600801_2_a
bg_08_forest
Look! The cheetahs are attacking
that herd of buffalo!
Siune
404600801_1_a
Leafa
404600701_70_a
Kirito
404600701_69_a
What is it, Siune?
Asuna
404600701_68_a
O-Oh no! Guys!!
Siune
404600701_67_a
Siune
404600701_66_a
Yeah, totally!
Yuuki
404600701_65_a
Leafa
404600701_64_a
Kirito
404600701_63_a
Hehe, that's great! You can tell
the fairies are all amazed by
these strange new creatures.
Asuna
404600701_62_a
I wanted to show what an animal
sanctuary would look like in the
realm of the fairies...
Yuuki
404600701_61_a
Siune
404600701_60_a
Ehehe, kind of puts a damper on
things, huh...
Yuuki
404600701_59_a
Leafa
404600701_58_a
Kirito
404600701_57_a
Yuuki...
Asuna
404600701_56_a
I drew this, thinking about all
the times we went to the zoo
when we were little...
Yuuki
404600701_55_a
Siune
404600701_54_a
Oh, um... Yeah.
That's me and Ran.
Yuuki
404600701_53_a
Leafa
404600701_52_a
Asuna
404600701_51_a
I bet I know who these two fairy
kids are in the background...
Kirito
404600701_50_a
Siune
404600701_49_a
Hahaha, come on, guys!
My ego can only take so
much inflating...
Yuuki
404600701_48_a
It's breathtaking... I bet it'd
take the grand prize in a
painting competition!
Leafa
404600701_47_a
The animals look like they could
leap right off the page!
Asuna
404600701_46_a
The fairies and all the animals
of the savannah...
Kirito
404600701_45_a
It's a work of art in
and of itself...
Leafa
404600701_44_a
Leafa
404600701_43_a
Kirito
404600701_42_a
This is amazing...
Asuna
404600701_41_a
I sent it in along with my entry
to the contest.
Yuuki
404600701_40_a
Siune
404600701_39_a
Yep. It's some concept art
for things other than monster
designs.
Yuuki
404600701_38_a
Leafa
404600701_37_a
Asuna
404600701_36_a
Hmm... Is this another one
of your drawings?
Kirito
404600701_35_a
Siune
404600701_34_a
Maybe!
Oh, that's right,
take a look at this...
Yuuki
404600701_33_a
Leafa
404600701_32_a
They must have been looking
for outside-the-box thinking in
this contest.
Kirito
404600701_31_a
Leafa
404600701_30_a
Asuna
404600701_29_a
Pretty impressive... Almost feels
like a loophole in the whole
"original" monster rule.
Kirito
404600701_28_a
Siune
404600701_27_a
Yep!
Yuuki
404600701_26_a
Leafa
404600701_25_a
So basically you reverse
engineered them to get back to
the animals they were based on.
Kirito
404600701_24_a
Leafa
404600701_23_a
Kirito
404600701_22_a
Gryphons are just chimeras
that are part eagle, part lion.
Asuna
404600701_21_a
Like dragons are just a mash-up
of reptiles and birds, with a dash
of crocodile thrown in.
Yuuki
404600701_20_a
Siune
404600701_19_a
Makes you realize just how many
fantastic beasts were inspired by
real animals.
Yuuki
404600701_18_a
Leafa
404600701_17_a
Hehe, yeah. Normally it happens
the other way around.
Kirito
404600701_16_a
I like how you've based the real
animals off of those mythical
creatures.
Asuna
404600701_15_a
Leafa
404600701_14_a
Kirito
404600701_13_a
Hehe, that's pretty cool.
Asuna
404600701_12_a
All I had to do was get rid of the
wings and the ability to fly.
Yuuki
404600701_11_a
I attached the texture from
Pegasus's model to the drawing
I made of a horse.
Yuuki
404600701_10_a
Siune
404600701_9_a
Hehe, bingo!
Yuuki
404600701_8_a
Oh, I know!
That Pegasus monster!
Leafa
404600701_7_a
Hmmm... I feel like I've seen
this horse somewhere before...
Kirito
404600701_6_a
Hehe, she looks like she's
enjoying her meal.
Asuna
404600701_5_a

404600701_1_a

404600601_50_a
Asuna
404600601_49_a
Sounds fun!
Kirito
404600601_48_a
Siune
404600601_47_a
Hehe. Well, how about we go
and feed some of them?
Yuuki
404600601_46_a
Leafa
404600601_45_a
Asuna
404600601_44_a
Still, I can't believe you used
that know-how to reproduce
real-world animals...
Kirito
404600601_43_a
Siune
404600601_42_a
Yep. Kirito taught me what
I needed to know to do that.
Yuuki
404600601_41_a
Leafa
404600601_40_a
did you end up using the
graphics and motions from
some existing monsters?
Asuna
404600601_39_a
Hey, Yuuki? The drawings you made
of these animals were really good,
but when you made them in 3D,
Asuna
404600601_38_a
Leafa
404600601_37_a
Asuna
404600601_36_a
Ha ha, can't argue there...
Kirito
404600601_35_a
Siune
404600601_34_a
Hahaha, I learned it all from
you, Kirito!
Yuuki
404600601_33_a
Leafa
404600601_32_a
Asuna
404600601_31_a
Wow, you really thought of
every last detail...
Kirito
404600601_30_a
I hope you guys enjoy it!
Yuuki
404600601_29_a
I tried to make them behave
as much like real-life animals
as I could...
Yuuki
404600601_28_a
Siune
404600601_27_a
Like feeding them, grooming them,
helping them with their babies...
Yuuki
404600601_26_a
Leafa
404600601_25_a
Asuna
404600601_24_a
Like what?
Kirito
404600601_23_a
There's plenty you're gonna
have to do to take care of
these animals.
Yuuki
404600601_22_a
Siune
404600601_21_a
Of course! Monster hunting is just
the first course!
Yuuki
404600601_20_a
Leafa
404600601_19_a
Kirito
404600601_18_a
You've got something else
in store after this?!
Asuna
404600601_17_a
Siune
404600601_16_a
Hehe, and that's not all!
Yuuki
404600601_15_a
Leafa
404600601_14_a
Yeah.
Kirito
404600601_13_a
It's gonna be pretty tough
fighting and protecting something
at the same time.
Leafa
404600601_12_a
That sounds about right,
considering the animals
all have really low stats.
Leafa
404600601_11_a
The monsters around here are
preying on the animals, and we
have to defeat them.
Kirito
404600601_10_a
Asuna
404600601_9_a
Leafa
404600601_8_a
Ahhh, I think I get it.
Kirito
404600601_7_a
Grraaaghk!!
Monster
404600601_6_a
Take THIS!

Monster
404600601_1_a
Asuna
404600501_48_a
Leafa
404600501_47_a
Yeah!
Kirito
404600501_46_a
Let the quest begin!
Yuuki
404600501_45_a
Siune
404600501_44_a
Hehe. Come on, guys! There's more
to do here than just look around!
Yuuki
404600501_43_a
Leafa
404600501_42_a
Oh, Yuuki, how thoughtful...
Asuna
404600501_41_a
Asuna
404600501_40_a
Leafa
404600501_39_a
Wow...
Kirito
404600501_38_a
So Yuuki made this quest with
people like them in mind...
Siune
404600501_37_a
Yuuki
404600501_36_a
There are lots of VRMMO players
who can't go out in real life as
easily as we can...
Siune
404600501_35_a
Asuna
404600501_34_a
Leafa
404600501_33_a
Yuuki...
Kirito
404600501_32_a
When I was little, I used to go to
the zoo all the time with Ran...
I just wanted to go again...
Yuuki
404600501_31_a
Siune
404600501_30_a
I mean, in real life, I can't
exactly get up and go to a
zoo or anything.
Yuuki
404600501_29_a
Kirito
404600501_28_a
Leafa
404600501_27_a
That's true...
Asuna
404600501_26_a
That's why I decided to make this
savannah into a safari park, full
of the real deal!
Yuuki
404600501_25_a
The more I thought about it, the
more I realized there aren't any
real-life animals in ALO.
Yuuki
404600501_24_a
Siune
404600501_23_a
Yep! They never said anything
about not drawing animals, heh.
Yuuki
404600501_22_a
Leafa
404600501_21_a
Are these all the monsters you
designed, Yuuki?
Kirito
404600501_20_a
And look, there's even a
flamingo over there!
Leafa
404600501_19_a
Lions and elephants
and camels and orangutans,
oh my!
Leafa
404600501_18_a
Asuna
404600501_17_a
Kirito
404600501_16_a
It's amazing!
Look at all those animals!
Leafa
404600501_15_a
I hope you like my ALO version
of a safari park!
Yuuki
404600501_14_a
Siune
404600501_13_a
Hehe, what do you think?
Yuuki
404600501_12_a
Leafa
404600501_11_a
Th-This is...
Asuna
404600501_10_a
Leafa
404600501_9_a
Asuna
404600501_8_a
bg_02_forest
Whoa...
Kirito
404600501_7_a
Hehe, I know, I know!
Yuuki
404600501_6_a
Great! And don't forget to thank
Kirito too!
Siune
404600501_5_a
They already did! I'm thinking of
letting Kirito and everyone else
know so we can go play ASAP!
Yuuki
404600501_4_a
That's awesome, Yuuki!
When are they going to
release your quest?
Siune
404600501_3_a
Siune
404600501_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
I did it!! They chose my entry
in the quest contest!!
Yuuki
404600501_1_a
Kirito
404600401_34_a
That's good! I guess now all we
have to do is wait.
Asuna
404600401_33_a
I actually feel pretty confident
in my submission too.
Yuuki
404600401_32_a
Siune
404600401_31_a
Hehe, I'm kiddiiiing.
I couldn't have done this
without your help.
Yuuki
404600401_30_a
Asuna
404600401_29_a
H-Huh?!
Kirito
404600401_28_a
Siune
404600401_27_a
I suppose so! You are teaching
me all sorts of quantum-level
techniques, after all!
Yuuki
404600401_26_a
Once they figure out how it works,
I'm positive the devs will fall in
love with this quest.
Kirito
404600401_25_a
Asuna
404600401_24_a
It'll be fine. After all, I'm a
pretty decent programmer,
if I do say so myself!
Kirito
404600401_23_a
Siune
404600401_22_a
Oooh, Kirito, I know you have high
hopes, but it might not even get
selected!
Yuuki
404600401_21_a
When her quest goes live, I want
to enjoy every surprise it has to
offer.
Kirito
404600401_20_a
Nope, I know nothing about it.
I was just there to teach her
how to use the Seed.
Kirito
404600401_19_a
Kirito
404600401_18_a
What about you, Kirito?
Asuna
404600401_17_a
Yuuki
404600401_16_a
Yeah, Yuuki showed me!
Siune
404600401_15_a
Kirito
404600401_14_a
Did you get a sneak-peek, Siune?
Asuna
404600401_13_a
You have nothing to worry about.
From what I saw, that quest is
top-quality!
Siune
404600401_12_a
Siune
404600401_11_a
Yeah! This is the first contest
I've ever entered, so I'm kind
of nervous...
Yuuki
404600401_10_a
Kirito
404600401_9_a
Way to go, Yuuki! Now we just
have to wait for the results
to come in!
Asuna
404600401_8_a
Siune
404600401_7_a
Alright... Sent!
Phew, I can't believe
it's all done!
Yuuki
404600401_6_a
Asuna
404600401_5_a
Right.
Kirito
404600401_4_a
So all I have to do is merge this
data and send it out, right?
Yuuki
404600401_3_a
Siune
404600401_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
I think...
that's the final touch!
Yuuki
404600401_1_a
Hehe, you're really excited about
this quest, aren't you?
Leafa
404600301_28_a
it's bound to be crawling with
insane enemies!
Kirito
404600301_27_a
My thoughts exactly. Plus,
considering the Zekken herself
is making this quest,
Kirito
404600301_26_a
Hehe, but it's probably better you
don't have a clue! It'll be more
fun to play going in blind.
Leafa
404600301_25_a
Well, that and doing odd jobs like
taking reference photos and stuff.
Kirito
404600301_24_a
Nope. All I'm doing is teaching
her how to use the Seed.
Kirito
404600301_23_a
You haven't asked her about it?
Leafa
404600301_22_a
Makes you wonder what kind of
quest it's going to be.
Kirito
404600301_21_a
Yeah, in the savannah that lies
between the Sylph and Salamander
territories...
Kirito
404600301_20_a
So then Yuuki's quest is going to
take place here?
Leafa
404600301_19_a
I just wanted to take some photos
in case she needed something to
reference. I'll show her later.
Kirito
404600301_18_a
I think this is exactly the kind
of backdrop Yuuki is imagining.
Kirito
404600301_17_a
Yep. Thanks for getting me
permission to enter Sylph
territory, Sugu.
Kirito
404600301_16_a
All done taking photos?

Alright, that should do it!
Kirito
404600301_13_a
Y-Yuuki...
Siune
404600301_12_a
...!
Siune
404600301_11_a
Wanna see?
Here, something like this.
Yuuki
404600301_10_a
What kind of monster are you
envisioning, Yuuki?
Siune
404600301_9_a
That's right. You do have to
design your own monster
for this thing, huh?
Siune
404600301_8_a
Hehe, well, he's not so good with
the artsy side of things, so there's
nothing he can do for me there.
Yuuki
404600301_7_a
Really? That must take a lot
of stress out of it.
Siune
404600301_6_a
I am! Kirito's teaching me a ton
so I can submit something super
good.
Yuuki
404600301_5_a
That you're entering the quest
contest! You are, aren't you?
Siune
404600301_4_a
What news, Siune?
Yuuki
404600301_3_a
Yuuki
404600301_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
I heard the news, Yuuki!
Siune
404600301_1_a
That would be great!
Thank you, Kirito!
Yuuki
404600201_25_a
Alright, Yuuki. If you wanna enter
this contest, how about I teach
you how to program?
Kirito
404600201_24_a
Dang... Even I can tell these
are masterfully done...
Kirito
404600201_23_a
Hehehe, I guess.
Yuuki
404600201_22_a
You were already this good
three whole years ago?!
Asuna
404600201_21_a
Yep!
About...three years ago or so.
Yuuki
404600201_20_a
Whoa...! You drew these, Yuuki?!
Kirito
404600201_19_a
Kirito
404600201_18_a
...!
Asuna
404600201_17_a
Aha! Here they are.
Yuuki
404600201_16_a
Umm... I should have some old
ones in my inventory...
Yuuki
404600201_15_a
Exactly! Oh, how about I show you
some of my drawings?
Yuuki
404600201_14_a
There's no way you'd be able to
draw anything good without
inherent ability, right, Yuuki?
Kirito
404600201_13_a
Which means, uh... Ahem.
They aren't really aimed at people
who aren't true artists.
Kirito
404600201_12_a
Come to think of it, some of those
programs do have an auto-draw
function, don't they?
Kirito
404600201_11_a
Wow... That's great!
Asuna
404600201_10_a
I spend lots of time alone in bed.
Plus, all the recent software
makes digital drawing a breeze!
Yuuki
404600201_9_a
I know! I'm actually a pretty
decent artist, if I do say so
myself.
Yuuki
404600201_8_a
You know you have to create your
own monster for it, right?
Kirito
404600201_7_a
Yep!
Yuuki
404600201_6_a
Are you talking about that
player-made quest contest?
Kirito
404600201_5_a
I wanna give it a shot!
Yuuki
404600201_4_a
Asuna
404600201_3_a
Kirito
404600201_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Whoaaa! That sounds awesome!
Yuuki
404600201_1_a
Heh, you're exactly right.
That's what makes this
so difficult for me.
Kazuto
404600101_32_a
It sounds like you would fall in
the former category, Daddy.
Yui
404600101_31_a
Ha ha, probably by suppressing the
embarrassment, or maybe they have
actual confidence in their work.
Kazuto
404600101_30_a
Then how do artists in the real
world ever exhibit the things
they've created?
Yui
404600101_29_a
and you get even more reluctant
to show something off when you
don't think it's that good...
Kazuto
404600101_28_a
But when you think about showing
it to other people, it just gets
embarrassing,
Kazuto
404600101_27_a
Creating something is fun
when it's JUST for you.
Kazuto
404600101_26_a
I'm...not sure what you mean,
Daddy...
Yui
404600101_25_a
I mean, I CAN, but nothing I'd
feel comfortable putting out
for other people to see...
Kazuto
404600101_24_a
Can't you draw, Daddy?
Yui
404600101_23_a
I'm not sure what I'm going to
do about the design...
Kazuto
404600101_22_a
Yeah. You're allowed to base your
monster's movements off of
existing data, but...
Kazuto
404600101_21_a
and monster creation would be
devising a behavioral model for
your creature, right?
Yui
404600101_20_a
Designing would be sketching out
a new monster and then creating
it in 3D,
Yui
404600101_19_a
Yeah... You need to be good at
designing and monster creation for
this, in addition to programming.
Kazuto
404600101_18_a
Players must include an
original monster that they have
created themselves... That part?
Yui
404600101_17_a
Ahem. Let's see...
Regarding quest submissions...
Yui
404600101_16_a
Here, look at this.
Kazuto
404600101_15_a
Well, it's not the programming
part that's the problem...
Kazuto
404600101_14_a
Then what's troubling you? Someone
with your abilities should have no
problem with this sort of thing!
Yui
404600101_13_a
Yeah...
Kazuto
404600101_12_a
create their very own quests,
doesn't it?
Yui
404600101_11_a
Oh, interesting! The Seed does
let anyone with basic programming
skills
Yui
404600101_10_a
Then the devs will select a few
outstanding entries to actually
implement in the game.
Kazuto
404600101_9_a
Players can submit quests they
created themselves using the Seed.
Kazuto
404600101_8_a
It's a contest they're holding
in ALO pretty soon.
Kazuto
404600101_7_a
...?
Yui
404600101_6_a
Well, not exactly, but I guess
technically you could call it a
quest of sorts...
Kazuto
404600101_5_a
Is it a quest?
Yui
404600101_4_a
Oh, I was just thinking about
giving this thing a shot...
Kazuto
404600101_3_a
What is it, Daddy?
Yui
404600101_2_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
Hmmm...
Kazuto
404600101_1_a
Exactly!
Asuna
404501201_27_a
Asuna
404501201_26_a
Don't overdo it, though. It's
still hard to predict what kind of
trouble you could get into with AR.
Kirito
404501201_25_a
Yes. I may not look it, but I
AM a veteran MMO player! I'll
teach those kids a thing or two!
Silica
404501201_24_a
You seem really into this,
Silica.
Sinon
404501201_23_a
Sinon
404501201_22_a
I agree! I'm going to try hard
to be a good role model for the
new players!
Silica
404501201_21_a
Yup. But the more the community
takes its behavior seriously, the
better the experience for all.
Asuna
404501201_20_a
So it's easy to get carried away.
Kirito
404501201_19_a
In OS, getting points leads to
real advantages IRL...
Kirito
404501201_18_a
At the end of the day, everyone
wants to have fun playing a game.
Kirito
404501201_17_a
Kirito
404501201_16_a
I guess it's hard to define what
bad sportsmanship is in that
context, huh...
Asuna
404501201_15_a
A PvP or ranked system is
inherently about getting ahead
of others, after all.
Kirito
404501201_14_a
Asuna
404501201_13_a
I actually think anything's game
as long as it doesn't break the
game's rules.
Kirito
404501201_12_a
Silica
404501201_11_a
Funny? Don't you mean unfair?
Sinon
404501201_10_a
Asuna
404501201_9_a
Yeah, but I didn't think those
funny playstyles would stop
BEFORE the devs did something.
Kirito
404501201_8_a
Sinon
404501201_7_a
Did you predict this, Kirito?
Silica
404501201_6_a
Kirito
404501201_5_a
I guess it doesn't mean too much
now, since bad behavior was on
the decline, anyway.
Asuna
404501201_4_a
Yeah. A campaign featuring Yuna!
Wow!
Silica
404501201_3_a
Silica
404501201_2_a
bg_os_cafe
I guess the devs had their own
plans on how to deal with it.
Sinon
404501201_1_a
Me too! Me too!
Audience
404501101_16_a
Awesome! I'm gonna be the nicest
EVAR!
Audience
404501101_15_a
we are giving away special points
and early access to a new
D-weapon!
Yuna
404501101_14_a
and to players who cooperated
with each other during the
event period,
Yuna
404501101_13_a
To those who played fairly,
Yuna
404501101_12_a
WHOOOOO!
Audience
404501101_11_a
It's called the Stop the
Unfair Gameplay Campaign!
Yuna
404501101_10_a
So...I'm going to announce a new
campaign, starting today!
Yuna
404501101_9_a
You can count on us, Yuna!
Audience
404501101_8_a
cheering
Audience
404501101_7_a
You are all noble Adapts defending
the earth from Unital! So no more
dishonesty, okay?
Yuna
404501101_6_a
I want everyone to fight fair
and square.
Yuna
404501101_5_a
And I don't want to see any
more of that!
Yuna
404501101_4_a
I heard there are some players
in OS lately who are being unfair
to others!
Yuna
404501101_3_a
cheering
Audience
404501101_2_a
bg_event_os_street
Hey, everyone! I need to ask you
all a favor!
Yuna
404501101_1_a
Hahaha!
Kirito
404501001_23_a
I thought we were gonna end this
conversation on a feel-good note!
Asuna
404501001_22_a
Aw, come on!
Asuna
404501001_21_a
In fact, I respect people who
can think of them first. It takes
creativity.
Kirito
404501001_20_a
I actually don't dislike
underhanded strategies and
exploiting loopholes, though.
Kirito
404501001_19_a
Kirito...
Asuna
404501001_18_a
...is because I learned how to
get along with others.
Kirito
404501001_17_a
I think the reason I went from
being a staunch solo player to
having a lot of friends...
Kirito
404501001_16_a
Well, it's based on personal
experience.
Kirito
404501001_15_a
Hehe, someone's been thinking
long and hard about this.
Asuna
404501001_14_a
I want to believe that they'll
eventually learn to cooperate
by playing together.
Kirito
404501001_13_a
Yeah... A big part of MMOs is
learning how to deal with other
people.
Kirito
404501001_12_a
So you wanna leave it up to
them to figure it out?
Asuna
404501001_11_a
But this is a game, and that's
okay. Forcing them into
submission isn't the answer.
Kirito
404501001_10_a
Teenagers tend to be competitive,
so sometimes scuffles are
unavoidable.
Kirito
404501001_9_a
I was paying attention, though.
Kirito
404501001_8_a
Ha ha, no way. Like I said before,
it's not something I could tackle
on my own.
Kirito
404501001_7_a
I thought maybe you had
something to do with it...
Asuna
404501001_6_a
Yeah, seems that way.
Kirito
404501001_5_a
There have been fewer reports of
trouble between younger players
lately.
Asuna
404501001_4_a
Hm? What's up?
Kirito
404501001_3_a
Kirito
404501001_2_a
bg_os_cafe
Kirito, I'm sure you've heard
this already...
Asuna
404501001_1_a
Heh, you mean she'll think I'm
really cool and mature!
Kirito
404500901_39_a
Hehe, Mommy's gonna make fun
of you again if you keep talking
like that!
Yui
404500901_38_a
And there are a lot of good kids
out there. Sometimes all you
need to do is talk to them.
Kirito
404500901_37_a
You might be right, Daddy.
Yui
404500901_36_a
It's that same passion that
creates the buzz and hype
around a game, after all.
Kirito
404500901_35_a
Plus, younger players getting
passionate and hot-headed isn't
inherently a bad thing.
Kirito
404500901_34_a
If it's not breaking any rules,
then it's just another way of
playing.
Kirito
404500901_33_a
Again, I don't think her strategy
itself was bad.
Kirito
404500901_32_a
Kirito
404500901_31_a
Daddy, I'm glad that girl's
started playing with the
method you taught her.
Yui
404500901_30_a
R-Really?!
Girl
404500901_29_a
Alright. Then I'll teach you a
little trick for winning battles.
Even beginners can do it.
Kirito
404500901_28_a
So I have to do whatever it takes
to climb the rankings!
Girl
404500901_27_a
It's just with how this game is
designed, it's really hard for
weaker players to get stronger.
Girl
404500901_26_a
Hmph! I didn't ask for any advice!
Girl
404500901_25_a
In fact, it might be interesting
to see how far you can go with
that strategy, ha ha.
Kirito
404500901_24_a
I'm not against what you're
doing, mind you. I think it's just
another way to play this game.
Kirito
404500901_23_a
But they listened, and were nice
to you...so I felt bad.
Kirito
404500901_22_a
I wouldn't have said anything if
those were just blind idiots
eager to do your bidding.
Kirito
404500901_21_a
Hey! What do you think you're
doing?!
Girl
404500901_20_a
Thanks again!
Boy A
404500901_19_a
Yeah...that was a close one.
Thanks for telling us, man.
Let's get out of here...
Boy B
404500901_18_a
Whoa, we almost got robbed!
Boy A
404500901_17_a
W-Wait! So he was telling
the truth?!
Boy B
404500901_16_a
Geez! Thanks a lot, buddy!
Girl
404500901_15_a
It's up to you whether you want
to believe me or not. I just
thought you should know.
Kirito
404500901_14_a
WHAT?!
Boy A
404500901_13_a
It's just, I heard her say the
same thing to other people
somewhere else.
Kirito
404500901_12_a
Who the hell are you?
Boy B
404500901_11_a
Huh?
Boy A
404500901_10_a
Sorry to butt in...
Kirito
404500901_9_a
Yeah! And a big part of MMOs is
helping other people out!
Boy B
404500901_8_a
Yeah, I feel sorry for her. We're
doing okay, so I guess a few
losses wouldn't matter that much.
Boy A
404500901_7_a
Well, she IS pretty low-ranked,
and I just saw some monsters
beating her up...
Boy B
404500901_6_a
Aw, I feel for you there. Hey,
dude, what do you think?
Boy A
404500901_5_a
I'm still really weak and my rank
is crap...
Girl
404500901_4_a
I know this is asking a lot,
but...could you let me win
in a PvP fight?
Girl
404500901_3_a
Kirito
404500901_2_a
bg_event_os_street
Hey, guys. Listen. I'm reaaally
hurting for points.
Girl
404500901_1_a
...
Asuna
404500801_25_a
Who knows? Anyway, I told Kirito
about it, and he wanted to know
who was doing it and where!
Silica
404500801_24_a
But wait... Is it still a crime if
the guy agrees to do it?
Asuna
404500801_23_a
Ah ha ha, a classic example
of the confidence game.
Asuna
404500801_22_a
Ugh...I know tons of dudes who'd
fall for that...
Sinon
404500801_21_a
I'd really like get some jewelry
with points... Could you lose to
me on purpose in PvP?
Silica
404500801_20_a
And once they get friendly,
she'll ask:
Silica
404500801_19_a
A pretty girl will ask a male
player for help...
Silica
404500801_18_a
Which is...?
Asuna
404500801_17_a
there's a new dirty strategy
going around.
Silica
404500801_16_a
That while players have stopped
mugging other players to score
points lately,
Silica
404500801_15_a
Well, it's something I'd heard
from someone else...
Silica
404500801_14_a
About what?
Asuna
404500801_13_a
Ooh, but Kirito seemed very
interested in something else
I mentioned.
Silica
404500801_12_a
You've got a point there...
Sinon
404500801_11_a
Not to mention, these types of
altercations aren't exclusive
to ARMMOs.
Asuna
404500801_10_a
It'd be impossible for anyone to
mediate every player dispute
on their own.
Asuna
404500801_9_a
Here's what I think. OS is
expanding in terms of both
player base and play locations.
Asuna
404500801_8_a
Y-Yeah... He does tend to go off
and try to fix things on his own.
Silica
404500801_7_a
On second thought...maybe he
would.
Asuna
404500801_6_a
Eh, even Kirito wouldn't go
that far.
Asuna
404500801_5_a
Yes. Knowing him, I was sure
he was going to take things
into his own hands...
Sinon
404500801_4_a
Sinon
404500801_3_a
Silica
404500801_2_a
bg_os_cafe
Ha ha, that's an interesting
conversation you had with
Kirito.
Asuna
404500801_1_a
Hmph, I don't believe you...
Sinon
404500701_26_a
We'll just have to leave it to
the game's management...
Kirito
404500701_25_a
I might be a little experienced
with games, but this isn't a
problem I could solve on my own.
Kirito
404500701_24_a
What?! Of course not!
Kirito
404500701_23_a
You'd like to personally go
around breaking these fights
up vigilante-style, don't you?
Sinon
404500701_22_a
Huh?
Kirito
404500701_21_a
I can guess what you're thinking
right now, Kirito.
Sinon
404500701_20_a
...
Kirito
404500701_19_a
They'll have to keep changing the
rules as they go along.
Kirito
404500701_18_a
Yeah. ARMMOs are still in their
infancy... Anything could happen.
Kirito
404500701_17_a
Ha ha. Isn't it funny how the same
type of beat-downs are happening
in AR now?
Sinon
404500701_16_a
Your story kind of reminds me
of that...
Kirito
404500701_15_a
in an arcade once, and it got so
heated they started beating each
other up for real...
Kirito
404500701_14_a
I heard something similar from
Agil before. He said he saw two
people playing a fighting game
Kirito
404500701_13_a
But it HAS resulted in more
nasty behavior.
Sinon
404500701_12_a
I think it's a good thing that
this game's gaining new players...
Sinon
404500701_11_a
Yeah. They seemed younger than
me, at least.
Sinon
404500701_10_a
Let me guess. They were kids,
right?
Kirito
404500701_9_a
They even took their Augmas off
and started beating each other up.
Sinon
404500701_8_a
Two people started fighting about
who gets to have the Last Attack
Bonus.
Sinon
404500701_7_a
There was a little scuffle with
the gunner team just now.
Sinon
404500701_6_a
Oh, yeah? What happened?
Kirito
404500701_5_a
sigh
That was no fun.
Sinon
404500701_4_a
Oh, hey, Sinon.
Kirito
404500701_3_a
Kirito
404500701_2_a
bg_event_os_street
Hey, Kirito.
Sinon
404500701_1_a
Is that a compliment or a dig?!
Kazuto
404500601_25_a
I bet you have the least to worry
about since you're a solo player
who doesn't join guilds.
Asuna
404500601_24_a
Asuna
404500601_23_a
Ha ha... We're just going to have
to be cautious.
Kazuto
404500601_22_a
Keiko
404500601_21_a
Yeah. What if we run into boys
like that again? It could turn
into an actual, physical fight.
Shino
404500601_20_a
ARMMOs are a totally different
story... Things can get pretty
dangerous.
Kazuto
404500601_19_a
and fairy rivalries seem harmless
enough.
Kazuto
404500601_18_a
Yeah. PvP works in ALO because
it's in a virtual world,
Kazuto
404500601_17_a
That's already three built-in,
infighting factions of Adapts.
Asuna
404500601_16_a
The Arbiters, who want to solve
the mysteries of the parallel world
and achieve peace with Unital...
Asuna
404500601_15_a
The Aggressors, who indiscriminately
attack DBAs and Adapts alike...
Asuna
404500601_14_a
There's the Guardians, who exist
to protect the earth...
Asuna
404500601_13_a
Kazuto
404500601_12_a
OS does seem like it was designed
to pit players against each other.
Asuna
404500601_11_a
I hate to admit it, but I think
Kirito made the right call.
Shino
404500601_9_a
Keiko
404500601_10_a
You never know what might
happen in AR.
Kazuto
404500601_8_a
Asuna
404500601_7_a
That's not all. They had seven or
eight people, while there were
only two of us...
Kazuto
404500601_6_a
But it was because you were being
considerate of me, right?
Keiko
404500601_5_a
Shino
404500601_4_a
Kirito decided to back down...
Keiko
404500601_3_a
Kazuto
404500601_2_a
bg_os_cafe
Wow. And then what happened?
Asuna
404500601_1_a
...
Kirito
404500501_25_a
K-Kirito...
Silica
404500501_24_a
We...better not.
Kirito
404500501_23_a
That's allowed in OS, y'know?
Boy
404500501_22_a
Whatever, bro. We can settle this
in a PvP battle, if you want.
Boy
404500501_21_a
You should make room for other
players to join the battle.
Kirito
404500501_20_a
Hey, you know, it's not fair when
you surround the boss with all
your friends like that.
Kirito
404500501_19_a
How else are we supposed to get
any points?
Boy
404500501_18_a
Heh heh, sorry, guys. We just
started.
Boy
404500501_17_a
sigh
... They stole the Last
Attack Bonus from us...
Silica
404500501_16_a
I knew we could defeat it if we
brought enough people!
Boy
404500501_15_a
Yeah! We did it!
Boy
404500501_14_a
Graaarrgh!
Monster
404500501_13_a
Th-Those brats...!
Kirito
404500501_12_a
If we all attack together,
there's no way we can lose!
Boy
404500501_11_a
Whaaat?!
Silica
404500501_9_a
Kirito
404500501_10_a
Guys! Surround it now!
Boy
404500501_8_a
Yaaaah!
Silica
404500501_7_a
O-Okay!
Silica
404500501_6_a
Now's your chance, Silica!
Kirito
404500501_5_a
Growwl!!
Monster
404500501_4_a
Now we just have to watch for
an opening so we'll know
where to strike next!
Kirito
404500501_3_a
Silica
404500501_2_a
bg_event_os_street
Yes...! We got the boss's HP
pretty low!
Kirito
404500501_1_a
Silica
404500401_40_a
I see... That's reassuring.
I feel a lot safer now.
Sinon
404500401_39_a
Just like we saw right now.
Kirito
404500401_38_a
They can also act like security
cameras to prevent crimes from
occurring in real time.
Kirito
404500401_37_a
Yup. OS flies a lot of drones
to keep its AR system running.
Kirito
404500401_36_a
Ohhhh. I get it.
Asuna
404500401_35_a
Tch... Let's go.
Boy A
404500401_34_a
We didn't even have enough time
to do anything!
Boy B
404500401_33_a
Wh-What's the police doing here?!
Boy B
404500401_32_a
Oh. Y-Yes, sir.
Boy A
404500401_31_a
Be careful, alright? It's
dangerous out here at night.
Police Officer
404500401_30_a
Wh-What?!
Boy A
404500401_29_a
Hey! You kids on your way home?
Police Officer
404500401_28_a
Huh?
Asuna
404500401_27_a
Wait... I don't think you need to.
Kirito
404500401_26_a
Kirito
404500401_25_a
Let's go save him!
Asuna
404500401_24_a
Yeah! We can't let them
get away with that!
Silica
404500401_23_a
Silica
404500401_22_a
What the hell? They're using
OS to threaten that guy!
Sinon
404500401_21_a
sniff
Boy C
404500401_20_a
Shut up! Do as we say, or we'll
knock your teeth out!
Boy B
404500401_19_a
Y-You're cowards for cornering me
like this!
Boy C
404500401_18_a
Heh heh... You know you wanna!
Boy B
404500401_17_a
Soooo... I want you to fight me
and let me win. Whaddya say?
Boy A
404500401_16_a
Hey. I need more points so I can
trade them for some movie tickets.
Boy A
404500401_15_a
Asuna
404500401_14_a
Hm?
Kirito
404500401_13_a
Check that out, guys!
Sinon
404500401_12_a
...!
Sinon
404500401_11_a
Y-Yeah. It's so dark, and the
streets are so narrow...
Silica
404500401_9_a
Sinon
404500401_10_a
Kirito
404500401_8_a
This area IS a little shady to
walk around alone at night.
Asuna
404500401_7_a
Silica
404500401_6_a
Hehe. Thanks, Kirito.
Sinon
404500401_5_a
Asuna
404500401_4_a
Yeah! Don't worry, I'll walk all
of you home.
Kirito
404500401_3_a
Sinon
404500401_2_a
bg_event_os_street_night
It's getting pretty late. Time
sure flies when you're having
fun!
Silica
404500401_1_a
Kirito
404500301_44_a
Hmm, interesting...
Asuna
404500301_43_a
Silica
404500301_42_a
Well, GGO has a lot of Real Money
Trading, so I know how nasty it
can get.
Sinon
404500301_41_a
Asuna
404500301_40_a
Hopefully people don't come up
with ways to play too dirty...
Kirito
404500301_39_a
I bet there are tons of loopholes
to exploit.
Sinon
404500301_38_a
Since it just launched, and there
are no other competing ARMMOs,
Sinon
404500301_37_a
Silica
404500301_36_a
Yeah... The main objective of this
game is to compete for points.
Sinon
404500301_35_a
You're worried about the bad
behavior typical of younger
players, right?
Kirito
404500301_34_a
I know what she's getting at.
Kirito
404500301_33_a
Kirito
404500301_32_a
Hm? What do you mean, Sinonon?
Asuna
404500301_31_a
Silica
404500301_30_a
Hopefully they stay that happy
playing the game...
Sinon
404500301_29_a
Kirito
404500301_28_a
Ha ha, I guess the newbies heard
us...
Asuna
404500301_27_a
That's so cool!
???
404500301_26_a
Whoa! You guys sure know a lot!
You must be long-time players,
huh?
???
404500301_25_a
Sinon
404500301_24_a
And we fight with D-Weapons
created using our D-Tuners!
Silica
404500301_23_a
Asuna
404500301_22_a
Yeah. The devs must have named
them that so they'd fit in with
the game's storyline.
Kirito
404500301_21_a
D-Tuners are the Augmas, right?
Sinon
404500301_20_a
And Adapts are called that because
they're compatible with the
D-Tuners supplied by The Order.
Silica
404500301_19_a
Sinon
404500301_18_a
Yuppers!
Silica
404500301_17_a
Kirito
404500301_16_a
We players are Adapts, the special
forces unit of The Order who fight
the DBAs, right?
Asuna
404500301_15_a
Silica
404500301_14_a
It makes sense. The lore in this
game is pretty complicated.
Sinon
404500301_13_a
Asuna
404500301_12_a
Ah... So they're going over the
story again for the new players.
Kirito
404500301_11_a
Yeah, I can't wait to play!
???
404500301_10_a
Wow, this game looks like
a ton of fun!
???
404500301_9_a
I guess it's like a recap.
Silica
404500301_8_a
Silica
404500301_7_a
It's similar to the one we were
shown when we first started
playing OS.
Sinon
404500301_6_a
Hm? This intro event seems
familiar...
Kirito
404500301_5_a
Invisible, living weapons known
as DBAs are being sent in from
the parallel universe of Unital...
Narration
404500301_4_a
Asuna
404500301_3_a
Kirito
404500301_2_a
bg_event_os_street
This world was on the verge of
destruction at the hands of an
unknown threat...
Narration
404500301_1_a
Asuna
404500201_34_a
I agree...
Kirito
404500201_33_a
sigh
... I'm not hating on their
enthusiasm, but I hope they don't
get too crazy.
Sinon
404500201_32_a
Silica
404500201_31_a
It was those high school kids
in a huddle over there.
Sinon
404500201_30_a
Kirito
404500201_29_a
Who was yelling, anyway?!
Asuna
404500201_28_a
Sinon
404500201_27_a
Y-Yeah. That just scared me a bit.
Silica
404500201_26_a
Asuna
404500201_25_a
You okay, Silica?
Kirito
404500201_24_a
gasp
Silica
404500201_23_a
YEAHH! LET'S DO THIS!
???
404500201_22_a
Cool, Silica's here too.
Sinon
404500201_21_a
Sinon
404500201_20_a
Hey everyone!
Silica
404500201_19_a
I do? Ugh, sorry...
Kirito
404500201_18_a
Geez, Kirito.
You sound like my dad.
Asuna
404500201_17_a
Er... I guess that doesn't mean
much since we're all in high
school too, though...
Kirito
404500201_16_a
and you have to physically get
places. It's not as simple as just
having an Augma in your room.
Kirito
404500201_15_a
Asuna
404500201_14_a
Yeah, it is strange. This game
naturally caters to adults because
there are a lot of night battles,
Kirito
404500201_13_a
but this place is crawling with
middle school and high school
students.
Sinon
404500201_12_a
Man. I'd always thought OS's
player base was mostly adults,
Sinon
404500201_11_a
Yeah, I was able to get off
work early.
Sinon
404500201_10_a
Kirito
404500201_9_a
Sinonon! You made it.
Asuna
404500201_8_a
That'd be my guess.
Sinon
404500201_7_a
Kirito
404500201_6_a
Yeah. Looks like this event drew
them all here.
Asuna
404500201_5_a
Whoa, that is a lot of people.
Kirito
404500201_4_a
Asuna
404500201_3_a
Kirito
404500201_2_a
bg_event_os_street
murmur
murmur
???
404500201_1_a
True, but we'll work together to
prevent that from happening!
Asuna
404500101_19_a
They could very well devolve into
a brawl.
Kazuto
404500101_18_a
Thanks, Yui. And you're right.
Multiplayer battles in AR are
never as clean as in VRMMOs.
Kazuto
404500101_17_a
I predict there will be a lot of
first-timers here today. The
battles could get messy!
Yui
404500101_16_a
Mommy, Daddy, please be careful.
Yui
404500101_15_a
Well, it's just supposed to
be for fun.
Kazuto
404500101_14_a
Hehe, I see. But don't you think
they'd look out of place in the
sci-fi world of OS?
Asuna
404500101_13_a
that looks like the uniforms of
one of those workplaces.
Yui
404500101_12_a
That's right. The top-ranking
players in this event will receive
equipment
Yui
404500101_11_a
I think they're doubling this as
a recruiting event for recent
college grads.
Kazuto
404500101_10_a
Wow, you weren't kidding.
Medical, aviation... Even the
police department!
Asuna
404500101_9_a
Here's a list.
Yui
404500101_8_a
There are a lot of different
companies here promoting
themselves!
Yui
404500101_7_a
Yep. The devs are using corporate
sponsorships to draw in new
players.
Kazuto
404500101_6_a
So they're here for the new
event, huh?
Asuna
404500101_5_a
It sure seems like it.
Kazuto
404500101_4_a
What a crowd! I wonder if they're
all OS players...
Asuna
404500101_3_a
Asuna
404500101_2_a
bg_event_os_street
Asuna, I think the Ordinal Scale
battle stage is this way.
Kazuto
404500101_1_a
Ha ha, we'll know soon enough!
Kirito
404401201_18_a
Me neither! I hope there are a lot
of summer events for ALO in the
works!
Leafa
404401201_17_a
And I for one can't wait to see
what the future holds.
Kirito
404401201_16_a
It's appropriate, no? The changing
of the seasons always makes me
sentimental.
Sakuya
404401201_15_a
Hehe, so it is. We all sound
like poets or something!
Leafa
404401201_14_a
The harbinger of summer.
Sakuya
404401201_13_a
And so the rainbow follows the
Rain...
Kirito
404401201_12_a
Wow... She's really living up
to her name.
Leafa
404401201_11_a
Yeah. That's a beautiful rainbow.
Kirito
404401201_10_a
Ooh... Look at the sky where
Rain was just flying!
Sakuya
404401201_9_a
What's wrong?
Leafa
404401201_8_a
Whoa!
Kirito
404401201_7_a
Sounds like you both have your
work cut out for you. Good luck!
...
Kirito
404401201_6_a
Indeed, thanks to waiting so long
for a sunny day.
Sakuya
404401201_5_a
Yeah! We're way behind schedule
on that Sylph event! It's supposed
to be happening now!
Leafa
404401201_4_a
Leafa
404401201_3_a
Kirito
404401201_2_a
bg_18_sky_morning_sunset
Well then, shall we head
back ourselves?
Sakuya
404401201_1_a
Sure thing! Thanks, Rain.
Kirito
404401101_19_a
I'll see you around, guys!
Rain
404401101_18_a
Kirito
404401101_17_a
Hehe, I told you I like going
outside in the rain, didn't I?
Rain
404401101_16_a
Sakuya
404401101_15_a
That's what you were doing in
that downpour?
Leafa
404401101_14_a
Kirito
404401101_13_a
I appreciate the offer, but
I can't. I was still in the middle
of gathering materials.
Rain
404401101_12_a
Leafa
404401101_11_a
So soon? Are you sure I can't
offer you some tea back at
my palace?
Sakuya
404401101_10_a
Okay, I should probably get going.
Rain
404401101_9_a
You think so? Thank you.
Rain
404401101_8_a
You've made remarkable progress
yourself, Rain.
Kirito
404401101_7_a
Hehe, nah, I'm just kidding.
You've really upped your game,
Kirito.
Rain
404401101_6_a
Oh! A sore loser, eh?
Kirito
404401101_5_a
Pfft, I would've won if it were
raining!
Rain
404401101_4_a
Yessss! I beat Rain!
Kirito
404401101_3_a
Kirito
404401101_2_a
bg_18_sky_morning_sunset
Argh... You got me.
Rain
404401101_1_a
Ha ha, I think it's nice of them
to give us a show.
Sakuya
404401001_38_a
You two really are combat-crazy...
Leafa
404401001_37_a
Sakuya
404401001_36_a
Really? You're gonna duel now?
After we just escaped with
our lives from the forest?
Leafa
404401001_35_a
Same to you!
Rain
404401001_34_a
Ha ha, awesome!
I'll make sure you
don't regret it!
Kirito
404401001_33_a
Alright, you're on!
Let's do it right here!
Rain
404401001_32_a
Hehe, I can see the fire in your
eyes. You're getting ME fired up!
Rain
404401001_31_a
...
Rain
404401001_30_a
But I want to try fighting you
for real one more time.
Kirito
404401001_29_a
Sure do. We can always wait for
another rainy day, if you want.
Kirito
404401001_28_a
Oh yeah? You want a rematch?
Rain
404401001_27_a
If you're still bitter about that
comment, I wouldn't mind a duel
or two.
Kirito
404401001_26_a
Ha ha, well, if it helps, that
fight just confirmed for me how
talented of a fighter you are.
Kirito
404401001_25_a
Kirito
404401001_24_a
Augh, it wasn't that muddy!
Why'd you have to ruin it
like that?
Rain
404401001_23_a
Sakuya
404401001_22_a
Hehe, I'll second that.
Leafa
404401001_21_a
Yeah, I noticed you really came
alive when we were fighting
those Nidhoggs, all wet and muddy.
Kirito
404401001_20_a
But I've finally realized that
I really do enjoy rainy days.
Rain
404401001_19_a
Kirito
404401001_18_a
Ha ha, well... I like how fresh
the air feels after it rains, too.
Rain
404401001_17_a
Sakuya
404401001_16_a
Are you a little sad now that
the rain has stopped?
Leafa
404401001_15_a
Hm? Oh, nothing. I'm fine.
Rain
404401001_14_a
What's the matter, Rain?
Kirito
404401001_13_a
...
Rain
404401001_12_a
Rain
404401001_11_a
No worries. We made it, and that's
what counts.
Kirito
404401001_10_a
Leafa
404401001_9_a
Hahaha! We were in quite the rush.
You have my apologies.
Sakuya
404401001_8_a
Rain
404401001_7_a
Me? The guy who wasn't even told
where we were going?
Kirito
404401001_6_a
Looking at you, Kirito!
Leafa
404401001_5_a
Sakuya
404401001_4_a
We really should've thought of
an escape plan...
Leafa
404401001_3_a
Rain
404401001_2_a
bg_18_sky_morning_sunset
Phew! I thought we were totally
trapped.
Kirito
404401001_1_a
Quick, guys! Spread your wings!
Leafa
404400901_22_a
Leafa
404400901_21_a
Ah, yes! That could be a way out!
Sakuya
404400901_20_a
Rain
404400901_19_a
So do you think our wings will be
able to absorb some power from
the sunlight?
Kirito
404400901_18_a
Sakuya
404400901_17_a
And making the rainwater
sparkle...
Leafa
404400901_16_a
Huh? Yeah, and sunlight's
filtering through the trees...
Rain
404400901_15_a
Hmm... The weather's cleared
up, right?
Kirito
404400901_14_a
Right, because it'd be really bad
if Sakuya died, wouldn't it?
Rain
404400901_13_a
Rain
404400901_12_a
No way...
There's got to be another option.
Kirito
404400901_11_a
Are we really gonna have to die
in here in order to get out?
Leafa
404400901_10_a
Wait a sec...
We can't fly in this
forest, can we?
Leafa
404400901_9_a
Thank goodness. That should keep
the Nidhogg population in check
and make the map safe to explore.
Sakuya
404400901_8_a
Sakuya
404400901_7_a
It's even making the water falling
off the leaves sparkle! This is
incredible!
Leafa
404400901_6_a
Wow...
The way the light filters through
the trees is absolutely gorgeous.
Rain
404400901_5_a
Rain
404400901_4_a
That did it!
The weather's clearing!
Kirito
404400901_3_a
Leafa
404400901_2_a
bg_02_forest
Oh ho!
Sakuya
404400901_1_a
Sakuya
404400801_38_a
Man, this sucks...
Leafa
404400801_37_a
Ha ha, yeah. You'll have to try
again once you're stronger, Leafa.
Kirito
404400801_36_a
Kirito
404400801_35_a
As the leader of the Sylphs
should be.
Rain
404400801_34_a
I'll try it. I should be at
a high enough level.
Sakuya
404400801_33_a
I'm not quite high enough...
Leafa
404400801_32_a
Sakuya
404400801_31_a
Yeah, it looks that way.
But the level requirement is
crazy high!
Leafa
404400801_30_a
Rain
404400801_29_a
Great! Is it something only Sylphs
can incant?
Kirito
404400801_28_a
If we incant the words carved on
this monument, we will acquire
the secret magic of the Sylphs.
Sakuya
404400801_27_a
Leafa
404400801_26_a
Indeed. That must be it.
Sakuya
404400801_25_a
Oh my gosh, we made it!
Woohoo!
Leafa
404400801_23_a
Leafa
404400801_22_a
No, I think that's the monument
we're looking for. Let's go!
Sakuya
404400801_21_a
What is that, some sort of
monolith?
Kirito
404400801_20_a
Hey guys, check out that massive
rock over there.
Kirito
404400801_19_a
But I'm glad I could help.
Rain
404400801_18_a
Kirito
404400801_17_a
No no, I was just passing
through...
Rain
404400801_16_a
Indeed. And we couldn't have done
it without Rain.
Sakuya
404400801_15_a
Sakuya
404400801_14_a
Phew... What a fight!
We're through the Nidhogg lair.
Leafa
404400801_13_a
Rain
404400801_11_a
Perfect!
Kirito
404400801_10_a
And you can leave healing to me!
Sakuya
404400801_9_a
Sakuya
404400801_8_a
Don't worry, I'll keep you buffed!
Leafa
404400801_7_a
Okay!
Rain
404400801_6_a
I'll run around behind them!
Kirito
404400801_5_a
That's it! Keep drawing their
aggro!
Kirito
404400801_4_a
Skraaawwwwrrrr!
Nidhogg
404400801_3_a
Kirito
404400801_2_a
bg_event_swamp
HYAAAAH!
Rain
404400801_1_a
I think we can take down those
Nidhoggs if you help me press
our attack!
Kirito
404400701_28_a
Rain
404400701_27_a
It's a long story. Rain, would you
mind helping us out?
Kirito
404400701_26_a
What is wrong with you two?
You're doubled over!
Sakuya
404400701_25_a
Sakuya
404400701_24_a
Ha ha, the path of least
resistance...
Leafa
404400701_23_a
Ha ha, the path of least
resistance...
Kirito
404400701_22_a
But it feels like one more way
that we share a connection.
I'm happy with that.
Rain
404400701_21_a
Looking back on it, I guess I took
the path of least resistance with
my name.
Rain
404400701_20_a
My sister's avatar name also takes
inspiration from her real name.
Seven colors in a rainbow, right?
Rain
404400701_19_a
Heh.
Rain
404400701_18_a
After all your real name is-
Actually, I shouldn't say it
in-game, hehe...
Kirito
404400701_17_a
Ah, gotcha. That makes sense.
Kirito
404400701_16_a
My avatar name is actually short
for Rainbow.
Rain
404400701_15_a
Kirito
404400701_14_a
Oh, and just so you know...
Rain
404400701_13_a
Leafa
404400701_12_a
I see.
Sakuya
404400701_11_a
I can just go out and do whatever
I want without worrying about
who might be watching.
Rain
404400701_10_a
It's mostly because there are
fewer people out.
Rain
404400701_9_a
But honestly...
Rain
404400701_8_a
Hahaha, I have always enjoyed
getting wet in the rain.
Rain
404400701_7_a
Rain
404400701_6_a
Oh c'mon, there's no way it's
that simple.
Kirito
404400701_5_a
...you're named after it!
Leafa
404400701_4_a
You go out in the rain because...
Leafa
404400701_3_a
Sakuya
404400701_2_a
bg_event_swamp
Aha! I know!
Leafa
404400701_1_a
Well, um...
Rain
404400601_33_a
Rain
404400601_32_a
You think she has one?
Kirito
404400601_31_a
Is there any particular reason why
you are?
Sakuya
404400601_30_a
Leafa
404400601_29_a
Yeah, I can't imagine many people
are out exploring in this weather.
Sakuya
404400601_28_a
Kirito
404400601_27_a
Tell me about it...
Rain
404400601_26_a
Sakuya
404400601_25_a
You sure picked a heck of a day
to go out wandering...
Leafa
404400601_24_a
Yeaaaaah, about that... Hehe...
Rain
404400601_23_a
Rain
404400601_22_a
I can't believe you just walked
in without knowing...
Kirito
404400601_21_a
Leafa
404400601_20_a
Correct. Once you've set foot
inside, you can't get out.
Sakuya
404400601_19_a
Kirito
404400601_18_a
Oh...
It's THAT kind of forest, huh?
Rain
404400601_17_a
Why?
Rain
404400601_15_a
Wait up! Don't just run
off into the woods!
Kirito
404400601_14_a
Spasiba...
Rain
404400601_13_a
Forgive me, Lady Sakuya.
I never intended to infiltrate
your territory, so I'll turn back.
Rain
404400601_12_a
Kirito
404400601_11_a
Are you serious?!
I knew I was off course,
but wow...
Rain
404400601_10_a
Indeed. And I am Sakuya, leader
of the Sylphs.
Sakuya
404400601_9_a
Sakuya
404400601_8_a
Well, you wound up in Sylph
territory!
Leafa
404400601_7_a
I was just looking to fight in
the neutral zone between the
Cait Sith and Sylph territories.
Rain
404400601_6_a
A place like what? Is there
something weird about
this forest or something?
Rain
404400601_5_a
Rain
404400601_4_a
What the heck are YOU doing
in a place like this?
Kirito
404400601_3_a
Sakuya
404400601_2_a
bg_event_swamp
Rain?!
Leafa
404400601_1_a
It is you! Privyet, guys!
What are you all up to?
Rain
404400501_19_a
Leafa
404400501_18_a
Sakuya
404400501_17_a
Who said that?!
Kirito
404400501_16_a
Is that who I think it is?
???
404400501_15_a
So there's no hope of calling
for backup this time...
Kirito
404400501_14_a
You've got that right.
Besides, everyone who
sets foot in here dies...
Kirito
404400501_13_a
let alone a player like Kirito.
They don't grow on trees-
not even in the ancient forest.
Sakuya
404400501_12_a
Ha ha, wouldn't that be nice?
But finding reinforcements
is tough on a good day,
Sakuya
404400501_11_a
We could offer support while you
two keep up the attack, and keep
the monsters from attacking.
Leafa
404400501_10_a
And if that attacker could strike
as powerfully as you do, Kirito...
Leafa
404400501_9_a
Maybe, but I still think we'd
need at least one more attacker.
Leafa
404400501_8_a
And you two buff and heal me,
we might be able to get away
with it.
Kirito
404400501_7_a
Actually... If I'm the attacker...
Kirito
404400501_6_a
This is true. We could figure
something out if we had a
tank player with us.
Sakuya
404400501_5_a
Well, the three of us can't fight
our way through that Nidhogg army.
Kirito
404400501_4_a
Sakuya
404400501_3_a
Kirito
404400501_2_a
bg_event_swamp
Soooo, what do we do now?
Leafa
404400501_1_a
Though I can't say for sure just
how far we'll get... Heh.
Kirito
404400401_33_a
And for that I thank you.
Sakuya
404400401_32_a
I'm right behind you, after all.
Kirito
404400401_31_a
I can certainly understand that.
Kirito
404400401_30_a
if I did not take part in this
search myself? I had to see
to this in person.
Sakuya
404400401_29_a
This is of great import to the
Sylphs. How could I lead my
people in good conscience,
Sakuya
404400401_28_a
I said the same thing!
But did she listen? Nope...
Leafa
404400401_27_a
You're the leader of the Sylphs.
Are you sure you should be out
here?
Kirito
404400401_26_a
Yeah, I'm good.
More importantly, are you?
Kirito
404400401_25_a
Leafa
404400401_24_a
Kirito
404400401_23_a
Are you okay, Kirito?
Sakuya
404400401_22_a
I guess we don't have a choice.
Kirito
404400401_21_a
Y-You got it!
Leafa
404400401_20_a
We have to get out of here!
We'll never kill them all!
Sakuya
404400401_19_a
You barely made it! That attack
would've killed you for sure.
Leafa
404400401_18_a
Sakuya
404400401_17_a
Leafa
404400401_16_a
That was a close one!
How many are there, anyway?!
Kirito
404400401_15_a
Sakuya
404400401_14_a
Leafa
404400401_13_a
Wha-!
Kirito
404400401_12_a
Skraaaaaaa!
Nidhogg
404400401_11_a
Kirito, look out!
Sakuya
404400401_10_a
This is about as bad as it gets...
Not only are we flightless, but
we're not even on solid footing!
Kirito
404400401_9_a
I'm okay! It looked like I was
gonna get stuck in the mud
there for a second!
Leafa
404400401_8_a
Leafa!
Sakuya
404400401_7_a
Whoa!
Leafa
404400401_6_a
Ungh! They're every bit as strong
as you said!
Kirito
404400401_5_a
Sakuya
404400401_4_a
Leafa
404400401_3_a
Kirito
404400401_2_a
bg_event_swamp
Skraaawwwwr!
Nidhogg
404400401_1_a
Ha ha, don't worry!
We'll figure it out... Probably.
Leafa
404400301_30_a
But then we'll never get out!
Do I get any say in this?!
Kirito
404400301_29_a
Sure, I'll explain all you want
while we're making our way
through the forest.
Leafa
404400301_28_a
Spell? Care to explain that too?
Kirito
404400301_27_a
We need to acquire that spell...
Sakuya
404400301_26_a
We must find that monument
at once.
Sakuya
404400301_25_a
You have my sincerest apologies
for the accelerated timeline.
Sakuya
404400301_24_a
But as Leafa said, we have little
time for strategizing.
Sakuya
404400301_23_a
Wait, wait, wait... We really need
to come up with a plan here.
Kirito
404400301_22_a
Watch out for those!
Leafa
404400301_21_a
Oh, and we'll probably encounter
swarms of these nasty serpent
things called the Nidhogg, so...
Leafa
404400301_20_a
So I suppose in one sense it IS
sacred ground.
Sakuya
404400301_19_a
What the-?
Kirito
404400301_18_a
By which she means they can't get
out and take a death penalty
in order to respawn outside.
Sakuya
404400301_17_a
Most people who set foot in it
get lost and just, uh, give up...
Leafa
404400301_16_a
Uhh... Okay, so let me explain.
See this forest up ahead?
Leafa
404400301_15_a
Wait, we need to prep for this?
What have you gotten me into?
Kirito
404400301_14_a
I thought we were in a big hurry,
and Kirito usually takes his time
when he preps for a quest.
Leafa
404400301_13_a
Why didn't you tell him the truth,
Leafa?
Sakuya
404400301_12_a
And here I thought Sakuya was
inviting me to explore this area
on behalf of the Sylphs.
Kirito
404400301_11_a
Slightly... More like totally. You
just said that to make sure I'd
come along.
Kirito
404400301_10_a
Okay, so the nuance is slightly
different! It's the same idea!
Leafa
404400301_9_a
You little liar!
Kirito
404400301_8_a
Yeaaaaah, about that... Hehe...
Leafa
404400301_7_a
Wait, what? Leafa told me...
Kirito
404400301_6_a
Ha ha, it's not sacred so much as
an area that no one dares set foot
in.
Sakuya
404400301_5_a
Not a problem, Sakuya. You had
me at "exploring a sacred area,"
to be honest.
Kirito
404400301_4_a
Leafa
404400301_3_a
Kirito
404400301_2_a
bg_event_swamp
My apologies for making you come
all this way, Kirito.
Sakuya
404400301_1_a
You must be joking!
Sakuya
404400201_24_a
That's where people are reporting
the Nidhogg have made their lair!
Recon
404400201_23_a
We are... Why do you ask?
Sakuya
404400201_22_a
S-Surely you're not thinking of
going into the ancient forest?
Recon
404400201_21_a
What is it, Recon?
Leafa
404400201_20_a
W-Wait a second!
Recon
404400201_19_a
Correct. People say it feels like
a dungeon, despite being above-
ground.
Sakuya
404400201_18_a
I've also heard that people get
lost in there because the map
doesn't show up, either.
Leafa
404400201_17_a
Deep in the forest, huh...?
We won't be able to fly, will we?
Leafa
404400201_16_a
We have to find a stone monument
deep in the ancient forest, where
the spell has been secreted away.
Sakuya
404400201_15_a
You're right about that. Okay,
let's continue the search for
that magic spell.
Sakuya
404400201_14_a
The game maps will become too
dangerous to explore.
Leafa
404400201_13_a
All I know is that we have to act
fast. We can't let those monsters
run wild.
Leafa
404400201_12_a
I think that's a pretty safe bet.
Sakuya
404400201_11_a
Y'know, we've had a lot of rain
lately... Think that has something
to do with it?
Leafa
404400201_10_a
Well, if the legend is any guide,
they live in bodies of water.
Leafa
404400201_9_a
What I don't understand is why
they're starting to pop up more
frequently in Sylph territory.
Recon
404400201_8_a
And I'd like to say they've
remained so...
Recon
404400201_7_a
Th-That's correct. And until now,
appearances were extremely rare.
Recon
404400201_6_a
I've heard that name. It's an
enormous serpent in Norse
mythology.
Sakuya
404400201_5_a
Yes! They're breeding all over
Sylph territory, from the plains
and forests to the swamps!
Recon
404400201_4_a
Sakuya
404400201_3_a
Recon
404400201_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
Nidhogg?
Leafa
404400201_1_a
That would be great, thanks.
Sakuya
404400101_27_a
You got it!
I'll give you a hand.
Leafa
404400101_26_a
I think it'd be worth our while to
try and track that magic down.
Sakuya
404400101_25_a
We'll end up canceling a lot more
than just tomorrow's event if it
keeps up.
Sakuya
404400101_24_a
Correct. I understand that they
want the seasons to be realistic,
but this is getting ridiculous.
Sakuya
404400101_23_a
But if we used it, we'd be able
to turn this rainy mess into
screaming blue skies!
Leafa
404400101_22_a
Holy crap...
That's literally godlike.
Leafa
404400101_21_a
I have even heard of magic that
allows one to reverse night
and day.
Sakuya
404400101_20_a
Indeed. Which is why it's been
written that Sylphs hid it-even
from themselves-for many years.
Sakuya
404400101_19_a
Are you kidding me?!
That kind of magic exists?!
Leafa
404400101_18_a
Not quite. This magic actually
allows you to CONTROL the weather.
Sakuya
404400101_17_a
Is that what you're talking about?
Leafa
404400101_16_a
Well, I know there's magic that any
Sylph can use to predict the next
day's weather.
Leafa
404400101_15_a
At least, I've heard there is
weather-related magic that
only Sylphs can use.
Sakuya
404400101_14_a
We Sylphs are the only race that
can control the weather.
Sakuya
404400101_13_a
Why? What do you mean?
Leafa
404400101_12_a
Hold that thought.
Sakuya
404400101_11_a
sigh
... I'm not sure if I should
be happy or sad about that...
Leafa
404400101_10_a
With weather this hot, you really
notice the difference when the
seasons change.
Sakuya
404400101_9_a
And Sylph territory is especially
hot and humid compared to the
other areas. It's like Japan.
Sakuya
404400101_8_a
Ha ha, well, ALO's not the only
VRMMO that creates its seasons
using real-world data.
Sakuya
404400101_7_a
You'd think they could at least
set the weather to sunny in VR!
Leafa
404400101_6_a
They'll be disappointed, no doubt.
It's bad enough that it's the
rainy season in real life!
Leafa
404400101_5_a
It looks that way. I'll tell
Recon to start notifying
the participants.
Sakuya
404400101_4_a
You can say that again.
Think we'll have to cancel
the Sylph event tomorrow?
Leafa
404400101_3_a
Leafa
404400101_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
Wow... It's really coming
down again today, huh?
Sakuya
404400101_1_a
Hehe, I'll be looking forward to it.
Asuna
404301201_25_a
O-Okay! I'll do my best!
Kirito
404301201_24_a
At least be emotionally ready
to be a husband in a few years,
okay?
Asuna
404301201_23_a
Hehe. Oh, Kirito...
Asuna
404301201_22_a
sigh
I think I'd just panic
in the real world too.
Kirito
404301201_21_a
Uhh... Er, well...
Kirito
404301201_20_a
I think the groom should support
and encourage his bride. Wouldn't
you agree?
Yui
404301201_19_a
What?!
Kirito
404301201_18_a
Why don't you think of it as
practice?
Yui
404301201_17_a
but you'll actually get married
in the real world too someday.
Yui
404301201_16_a
Now, now, Daddy. You said this
was another reality to you,
Yui
404301201_15_a
S-Stop that!
You're making me feel weird!
Kirito
404301201_14_a
Thanks, Yui... 
sob
I'm getting all emotional here...
Asuna
404301201_13_a
Thank you, Yui.
Kirito
404301201_12_a
Congratulations, Mommy and
Daddy!
Yui
404301201_11_a
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Yui
404301201_10_a
I do.
Asuna
404301201_9_a
for richer or for poorer, in
sickness and in health, until
death do you part?
Yui
404301201_8_a
Asuna. Do you take Kirito to be
your husband, to have and to
hold from this day forward,
Yui
404301201_7_a
I do.
Kirito
404301201_6_a
for richer or for poorer, in
sickness and in health, until
death do you part?
Yui
404301201_5_a
Do you, Kirito, take Asuna to
be your wife, to have and to
hold from this day forward,
Yui
404301201_4_a
Asuna
404301201_3_a
Kirito
404301201_2_a
bg_event_wedding_town
Well, then...
Yui
404301201_1_a
Yes! Of course, Yui!
Asuna
404301101_17_a
Ahem. If you don't mind, I'd like
to be the officiant that marries
you two!
Yui
404301101_16_a
I agree... Hearing you say that
makes me so happy, Kirito.
Asuna
404301101_15_a
Let's do the ceremony, Asuna,
as a symbol of our marriage.
Kirito
404301101_14_a
So when we got married in SAO...
That was real to us too.
Kirito
404301101_13_a
This place is just another form
of reality to us.
Kirito
404301101_12_a
I feel the same way.
Kirito
404301101_11_a
Because...I really, really wanted
a wedding with you.
Asuna
404301101_10_a
I really couldn't let myself lose.
That's why I took all of the
fights so seriously.
Asuna
404301101_9_a
Asuna...
Kirito
404301101_8_a
Though...I couldn't figure out
exactly what that was for them...
Asuna
404301101_7_a
I realized they had a passion,
a strong reason why they just
couldn't back down. Just like me.
Asuna
404301101_6_a
I really believed Sinonon and the
others were just in it for the
reward. But after fighting them,
Asuna
404301101_5_a
Everyone has something they want
to protect in this virtual world.
Asuna
404301101_4_a
Kirito
404301101_3_a
Yui
404301101_2_a
bg_event_wedding_town
I learned a lot these past few
battles too.
Asuna
404301101_1_a
Hehe, I bet.
Asuna
404301001_29_a
but I think Daddy gave that boy
a lot of hope.
Yui
404301001_28_a
The wedding itself ended up
being canceled,
Yui
404301001_27_a
Yeah... I guess she understood
how the boy felt about her.
Kirito
404301001_26_a
Whoa, really!
Asuna
404301001_25_a
ended up dumping the guy she
was supposed to be in the wedding
with!
Yui
404301001_24_a
The girl, so moved by the boy's
determination,
Yui
404301001_23_a
Hehe, but something unexpected
happened after that.
Yui
404301001_22_a
Ah... Disappointing, huh.
Asuna
404301001_21_a
He lost badly, of course.
Kirito
404301001_20_a
We prepared as best we could
before going into the fight...
Kirito
404301001_19_a
So, what happened?
Asuna
404301001_18_a
C-Come on, Yui!
Th-That was just a joke.
Kirito
404301001_17_a
What?!
Asuna
404301001_16_a
To think Daddy was going to
take a nap!
Yui
404301001_15_a
In the end, his resolution won me
over so I helped him grind some
levels.
Kirito
404301001_14_a
He was adamant that she see him
fighting to win her love.
Kirito
404301001_13_a
But he said that even if he fails,
he at least wants to show the
girl that he tried.
Kirito
404301001_12_a
So I told him in the beginning
that one training session wasn't
going to be enough to win.
Kirito
404301001_11_a
I asked about the player he had
to fight. Turned out the guy's
pretty good.
Kirito
404301001_10_a
I see...
So what did you do, Kirito?
Asuna
404301001_9_a
if he could be taught by someone
as good as Daddy, he could get
strong enough to stand a chance.
Yui
404301001_8_a
But he didn't have very high skill
levels, so he thought
Yui
404301001_7_a
He wanted to use this
opportunity to tell a girl
how he feels.
Yui
404301001_6_a
...
Asuna
404301001_5_a
But he wasn't doing it as part
of a couple. He was a challenger.
Yui
404301001_4_a
Kirito
404301001_3_a
Asuna
404301001_2_a
bg_event_wedding_town
That boy was participating in
the wedding event, just like
you and Daddy.
Yui
404301001_1_a
Uhh... Tell me what's going
on first.
Kirito
404300901_26_a
Yes!
...Please?
Boy
404300901_25_a
Train you?
Kirito
404300901_24_a
N-No... I was wondering if you
could train me...
Boy
404300901_23_a
That's right...
So you're not a challenger, then?
Kirito
404300901_22_a
Kirito
404300901_21_a
E-Excuse me...
You're Kirito, aren't you?
Boy
404300901_20_a
Asuna
404300901_19_a
Kirito
404300901_18_a
Sure.
Yui
404300901_17_a
Could you explain, Yui?
Asuna
404300901_16_a
Ah, well...
Kirito
404300901_15_a
Hm? What do you mean?
Asuna
404300901_14_a
Daddy was working hard outside
of battle too, Mommy.
Yui
404300901_13_a
Ha ha. Yeah, I sure had the cream
of the crop.
Asuna
404300901_12_a
so I've actually been done for
a while.
Kirito
404300901_11_a
Well, none of my challengers
were as good as yours,
Kirito
404300901_10_a
What about you, Kirito?
Asuna
404300901_9_a
You defeated all your
challengers! That's amazing!
Kirito
404300901_8_a
I'm really proud of you, Asuna.
Kirito
404300901_7_a
Y-Yeah... It was tough fighting
all those strong players in a
row, though...
Asuna
404300901_6_a
Asuna! A-Are you okay?!
Kirito
404300901_5_a
Kirito... I'm back...
Asuna
404300901_4_a
Kirito
404300901_3_a
Yui
404300901_2_a
bg_event_wedding_town
Phew... I-I won...
Asuna
404300901_1_a
Hehe, nice! I'm really getting
into this!
Sinon
404300801_33_a
Not even Kirito or Yuuki can top
my piercing attacks, you know!
Asuna
404300801_32_a
Urgh! Your attacks are so fluid!
Sinon
404300801_31_a
Yaaaaah!
Asuna
404300801_30_a
Good thinking, Sinonon...
Still not going to lose, though!
Asuna
404300801_29_a
Also, I figured my range wouldn't
be as effective against you
since you use magic.
Sinon
404300801_28_a
That's why it's easy enough
for me to pick it up.
Sinon
404300801_27_a
My race has a bunch of dagger
wielders. Silica and Argo, for
example.
Sinon
404300801_26_a
You're right, and I'm impressed.
I really didn't see that knife
attack coming.
Asuna
404300801_25_a
But it turns out assumptions
can be dangerous.
Sinon
404300801_24_a
I bet you were imagining I'd
fight how I always do...
Sinon
404300801_23_a
Hng...!
Asuna
404300801_22_a
Haah!
Sinon
404300801_21_a
Just because I use a bow and
arrow doesn't mean I'll always
attack from far away!
Sinon
404300801_20_a
Huh?! A close-range attack?!
Asuna
404300801_19_a
Haaaaah!
Sinon
404300801_18_a
It won't be that eas
Hey!
Asuna
404300801_17_a
I'll defeat you, for Liz and
the other girls!
Sinon
404300801_16_a
...I think that's enough chatting
for now.
Sinon
404300801_15_a
Sinonon?
Asuna
404300801_14_a
...I see. Maybe my reasons for
fighting have changed over time
too...
Sinon
404300801_13_a
But here, I can work hard purely
to become a better player. And
that makes me happy.
Asuna
404300801_12_a
Yup. Duels represented something
completely different in SAO...
Asuna
404300801_11_a
Asuna... Didn't you say before
that duels weren't your strong
suit?
Sinon
404300801_10_a
So I just feel really good about
being able to experience it
today.
Asuna
404300801_9_a
I told Liz this too, but we
don't get a chance at serious
fights like this very often.
Asuna
404300801_8_a
Happy...?
Sinon
404300801_7_a
Nope...but more than that,
I'm happy.
Asuna
404300801_6_a
Heh. You look really confident.
You don't believe you'll lose for
a second.
Sinon
404300801_5_a
You're the last one standing,
Sinonon.
Asuna
404300801_4_a
I see you've defeated Leafa,
Silica, and even Liz...
Sinon
404300801_3_a
Asuna
404300801_2_a
bg_event_field
Impressive, Asuna...
Sinon
404300801_1_a
You got it!
Asuna
404300701_31_a
It wasn't a compliment!
Anyway, let's do this!
Liz
404300701_30_a
Hehehe, you think so?
Asuna
404300701_29_a
E-Excited? At a time like this?
Geez... I think you're becoming
a little too much like Kirito.
Liz
404300701_28_a
Wow, Liz! I'm really getting
excited here!
Asuna
404300701_27_a
but I CAN summon low durability
weapons one at a time!
Liz
404300701_26_a
I can't summon multiple weapons
simultaneously like Thousand
Rain,
Liz
404300701_25_a
Rain! Yes! It's like a simpler
version of her skill.
Liz
404300701_24_a
That's almost like
Asuna
404300701_23_a
Hehe, that's right. I made a
bunch of 'em for this fight!
Liz
404300701_22_a
but it's as powerful as a
Legendary Weapon!
Asuna
404300701_21_a
That weapon...! I heard it can
only be used a few times before
it breaks...
Asuna
404300701_20_a
How do you like this monster of
a hammer?!
Liz
404300701_19_a
Aah!!
Asuna
404300701_18_a
Take this!
Liz
404300701_17_a
Wha?!
Asuna
404300701_16_a
Summon weapon!
Liz
404300701_15_a
I've done some preparations
just for such an occasion!
Liz
404300701_14_a
...?!
Asuna
404300701_13_a
Hehe. I could never win a head-on
duel against you, so...
Liz
404300701_12_a
Let's do this! I won't let
you best me, Liz!
Asuna
404300701_11_a
Anyway, my turn!
Liz
404300701_10_a
Oh, nothing.
Liz
404300701_9_a
Huh?
Asuna
404300701_8_a
Hehe, I guess they haven't
given up either, then.
Liz
404300701_7_a
...
Liz
404300701_6_a
They really wanted to win, too...
There were a couple moments
where I thought I was gonna lose.
Asuna
404300701_5_a
Yep...
They were both really tough.
Asuna
404300701_4_a
That means Leafa and Silica
must have been defeated.
Liz
404300701_3_a
Asuna
404300701_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
Asuna... If you're here...
Liz
404300701_1_a
Glad to hear it!
Silica
404300601_30_a
Anyway, let's fight! I won't
go easy on you!
Asuna
404300601_29_a
Ha ha... Sorry.
Silica
404300601_28_a
Hey! I'm self-conscious about
that last one, okay?
Asuna
404300601_27_a
No wonder they call you the
Lightning Flash and the Berserk
Healer...
Silica
404300601_26_a
Hahaha... Oh, Asuna. Valiant as
ever, and laughing in the face
of danger.
Silica
404300601_25_a
when we're doing quests together
as allies!
Asuna
404300601_24_a
We don't get many opportunities
to duke it out like this
Asuna
404300601_23_a
Hehe, nice thinking, Silica!
This is so much fun!
Asuna
404300601_22_a
So the only thing left for me
is to fight as a Cait Sith, with
my tamed monster!
Silica
404300601_21_a
I don't have your fighting
prowess or your healing magic.
Silica
404300601_20_a
Argh! So that's why you were
waiting for me here!
Asuna
404300601_19_a
Yup! This particular area turns
monsters' elemental attacks into
special attacks!
Silica
404300601_18_a
Your bubble attack's different
this time!
Asuna
404300601_17_a
Chiiiiiirp!!
Pina
404300601_16_a
Agh! Trying to blind me? That's
not gonna work!
Wait...!
Asuna
404300601_15_a
Silica
404300601_14_a
Asuna
404300601_13_a
Chiiirp!
Pina
404300601_12_a
Pina, use your bubbles!
Silica
404300601_11_a
Of course!
Silica
404300601_10_a
Hehe, that doesn't mean I'll go
easy on you!
Asuna
404300601_9_a
Asuna...
Silica
404300601_8_a
I just want a chance to have a
wedding with Kirito in ALO...
That's all.
Asuna
404300601_7_a
I see... Come to think of it,
I'm not too interested in the
reward.
Asuna
404300601_6_a
I really want the quest
rewards, I mean! Y-Yeah!
Silica
404300601_5_a
Well, you're not the only one
who wants to marry
N-No, I mean!
Silica
404300601_4_a
Silica...! I didn't think
you'd be here.
Asuna
404300601_3_a
Asuna
404300601_2_a
bg_event_remains
Asuna, you're going down!
Silica
404300601_1_a
Yeah. Sinonon, Liz, Silica...
But I'm ready!
Asuna
404300501_19_a
It was. Anyway, good luck.
You've still got a lot of people
lined up.
Leafa
404300501_18_a
Thanks, Leafa! It was a
good fight!
Asuna
404300501_17_a
sigh
... Well, guess I gotta
concede defeat.
Leafa
404300501_16_a
Well, it was smart. I can't fly
for crap in a place surrounded
by trees like this...
Leafa
404300501_15_a
So, I guided you here as I casted
debuff spells on you.
Asuna
404300501_14_a
so I had to get creative and
think of ways to make it difficult
for you to use that speed...
Asuna
404300501_13_a
You're right. You're way faster
than me,
Asuna
404300501_12_a
Leafa...
Asuna
404300501_11_a
All those strategies you used
to keep me from utilizing my
speed!
Leafa
404300501_10_a
Asuna...
You really are something.
Leafa
404300501_9_a
Asuna
404300501_8_a
I-I lost...
Leafa
404300501_7_a
Ugh...!
Leafa
404300501_6_a
Yaaaaah!
Asuna
404300501_5_a
I can't lose this fight,
no matter what!
Asuna
404300501_4_a
Leafa...
Asuna
404300501_3_a
Asuna
404300501_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Gah...!
Leafa
404300501_1_a
...?
Kirito
404300401_22_a
N-No... That's not it...
???
404300401_21_a
I'm ready! Come at me!
Kirito
404300401_20_a
Hm? You another challenger?
Kirito
404300401_19_a
E-Excuse me...!
???
404300401_18_a
Daddy! You shouldn't be
THAT relaxed!
Yui
404300401_17_a
Oh... I'm getting sleepy...
Maybe I should take a nap...
Kirito
404300401_16_a
Hehe, that's true.
Yui
404300401_15_a
It's basically a battle to decide
the best female ALO player.
Kirito
404300401_14_a
Yeah, I wish I could join them.
Getting to fight Sinon, Sugu,
Silica, AND Liz?
Kirito
404300401_13_a
Maybe. It's interesting how
different your situation is from
Mommy's.
Yui
404300401_12_a
Anyway, I bet only moochers are
trying to get paired up with us.
Kirito
404300401_11_a
That's not true. There are a
lot of people in ALO who are
stronger than me.
Kirito
404300401_10_a
I think you're just too strong.
Yui
404300401_9_a
I wish I could fight ONE person
who's at my level...
Kirito
404300401_8_a
Yeah... I just finished defeating
all of them.
Kirito
404300401_7_a
With your challengers, Daddy?
Yui
404300401_6_a
Oh, you know... I'm just feeling
a little disappointed.
Kirito
404300401_5_a
Kirito
404300401_4_a
What's wrong, Daddy?
Yui
404300401_3_a
Ugh...
Kirito
404300401_2_a
bg_event_wedding_town
Hmm...
Kirito
404300401_1_a
I will!
Asuna
404300301_26_a
Asuna... Alright. I won't hold
back, then. You better get ready
for us!
Sinon
404300301_25_a
In fact, I'm really excited to
be able to seriously fight you
guys!
Asuna
404300301_24_a
Don't worry about it. These
things are bound to happen
in a game focused on PvP.
Asuna
404300301_23_a
Asuna... We're not causing you
too much trouble, are we...?
Sinon
404300301_22_a
Yep! And I'm not going down! I'm
ready and willing to fight whoever
wants to challenge me!
Asuna
404300301_21_a
It's completely understandable...
Sinon
404300301_20_a
I-I guess. You're both pretty
well-known at this point.
Sinon
404300301_19_a
I guess they really want to be
partnered up with high-ranking
players for the next quest.
Asuna
404300301_18_a
Yeah... A lot of male players
want to fight Kirito to marry
me too.
Asuna
404300301_17_a
There are?
Sinon
404300301_16_a
Not to mention, there are a
bunch of other challengers.
Asuna
404300301_15_a
Yeah! That's super weird!
Ha ha...ha...
Sinon
404300301_14_a
You guys don't have to tell me.
I know there's no other reason.
So why do you all do that...?
Asuna
404300301_13_a
R-Really...? Hahaha...
H-How about that?
Sinon
404300301_12_a
...!
Sinon
404300301_11_a
Everyone's giving me that same
disclaimer. "I'm only doing this
for the reward!"
Asuna
404300301_10_a
Earlier I was talking to Liz,
Silica, and Leafa about it too.
Asuna
404300301_9_a
What is?
Sinon
404300301_8_a
But...it's kind of weird.
Asuna
404300301_7_a
Yeah. I know.
Asuna
404300301_6_a
I'm only participating for the
reward.
Sinon
404300301_5_a
And, uh... Asuna...
just so you know...
Sinon
404300301_4_a
Hehe, right back at you!
Sinon
404300301_3_a
Sinon
404300301_2_a
bg_event_field
There's no way I'm losing
this event, Sinonon.
Asuna
404300301_1_a
Alright. I'll be rooting for you.
Kirito
404300201_25_a
Don't worry, I'll win this
wedding through pure skill!
Asuna
404300201_24_a
The least I can do is respect
that and accept their challenge.
Asuna
404300201_23_a
No, don't. Liz and the others
want to fight me as fellow
players.
Asuna
404300201_22_a
Asuna... I can just ask them to
sit this one out, you know?
Kirito
404300201_21_a
It all makes sense now...
and I'm not backing down.
Asuna
404300201_20_a
I see. So you HAVE to do the
wedding to even do this other
quest.
Kirito
404300201_19_a
Well, more accurately, successfully
married couples are given the
option to take on another quest.
Yui
404300201_18_a
Uh... But why would you get some
special reward just for being in a
wedding?
Kirito
404300201_17_a
I think they all just want
a chance to get it.
Yui
404300201_16_a
Apparently it's because successful
couples can get a special reward.
Yui
404300201_15_a
Kirito
404300201_14_a
Asuna
404300201_13_a
Mommy, Daddy, I asked
them about that myself.
Yui
404300201_12_a
I don't know... Why wouldn't they
want us to have a wedding...?
Asuna
404300201_11_a
Wh-Why would they
do such a thing?
Kirito
404300201_10_a
Whaaat?!
Kirito
404300201_9_a
I know, but Liz and the others
said they're going to register
as challengers!
Asuna
404300201_8_a
Things were too hectic in SAO
to have a proper wedding, after
all.
Kirito
404300201_7_a
I'm pretty excited
about it, actually.
Kirito
404300201_6_a
Uh-huh.
Kirito
404300201_5_a
You know the wedding event we
registered for the other day?
Asuna
404300201_4_a
Asuna? What's wrong?
Kirito
404300201_3_a
Kirito
404300201_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
K-Kirito!
Asuna
404300201_1_a
Hahahaha...
Silica
404300101_40_a
Hehehe...
Liz
404300101_39_a
W-Well, uhh... Ha ha...
Leafa
404300101_38_a
...G-Guys? You're scaring me.
Sinon
404300101_37_a
...
Leafa
404300101_36_a
...
Liz
404300101_35_a
...
Silica
404300101_34_a
...It also says that those who are
successfully married will have a
chance at a special reward.
Sinon
404300101_33_a
No one would ACTUALLY do such
a thing, would they?
Leafa
404300101_32_a
Ah, yeah.
Sinon
404300101_31_a
It's like in those movies where
people barge in on their love
interest at the altar!
Liz
404300101_30_a
Th-That's ridiculous!
Liz
404300101_29_a
And the right to the wedding
is granted to the winner.
Sinon
404300101_28_a
Yeah. Then the wedding becomes
invalid. The challenger must
fight their rival...
Sinon
404300101_27_a
Wh-What?
Silica
404300101_26_a
But other players are also
allowed to register to oppose
the wedding.
Sinon
404300101_25_a
Couples register beforehand,
and wait for the big day
together...
Sinon
404300101_24_a
Hmm. Like what?
Leafa
404300101_23_a
This event's got some weird rules.
Sinon
404300101_22_a
Oh, but... Wait a second...
Sinon
404300101_21_a
Noooo...
Silica
404300101_20_a
Well, duh.
Liz
404300101_19_a
I just looked up the event details,
and it seems there's a one wedding
limit per player.
Sinon
404300101_18_a
but I doubt he'd agree to a
wedding with you. You are kind
of like a sister to him.
Liz
404300101_17_a
Seriously. Now I know
you guys are close,
Liz
404300101_16_a
Ha ha. Sorry to burst your bubble,
Silica, but my big bro's already
got Asuna.
Leafa
404300101_15_a
Er... W-Well...
Silica
404300101_14_a
I know what YOU'RE thinking,
Silica. You want to participate
with Kirito!
Liz
404300101_13_a
N-No, I just...
Sinon
404300101_12_a
Oh, Sinon, you're curious
about it too?
Silica
404300101_11_a
Hm, that sounds interesting...
Sinon
404300101_10_a
That's where you can pair up with
someone for a wedding in a chapel
in the forest, right?
Liz
404300101_9_a
Yeah, I just read about it on
the info page.
Liz
404300101_8_a
Y-You know about it too, Liz?!
Silica
404300101_7_a
You saw the announcement for
the wedding event, didn't you?
Liz
404300101_6_a
Hehe, I bet I know what
this is about.
Liz
404300101_5_a
Silica?!
What's wrong?!
Leafa
404300101_4_a
Liz
404300101_3_a
Leafa
404300101_2_a
bg_event_field
O-Oh no! It's an emergency!
Silica
404300101_1_a
Ahahaha...
Kirito
404201201_56_a
Yes! I can't wait to see you
"blow another joint" again, Daddy!
Yui
404201201_55_a
Oh, I think it suits someone
who just earned his stripes
as a true Spriggan!
Leafa
404201201_54_a
Yui
404201201_53_a
Leafa
404201201_52_a
Come on, surely I've earned a
cooler alias than that!
Kirito
404201201_51_a
Yuuki
404201201_50_a
Sinon
404201201_49_a
Ahaha, nice job today, Kirito
I mean, Mr. Kitty!
Asuna
404201201_48_a
Yuuki
404201201_47_a
Asuna
404201201_46_a
Good idea. Oh, I suppose we should
award today's MVP to our little
cat burglar, hm?
Sinon
404201201_45_a
Kirito
404201201_44_a
Yui
404201201_43_a
Same here! Then let's head home
for now and plan on coming back
together sometime soon.
Leafa
404201201_42_a
Asuna
404201201_41_a
Sinon
404201201_40_a
Ooh, that sounds awesome!
I can't wait to come back here
and try out another quest!
Yuuki
404201201_39_a
Leafa
404201201_38_a
Kirito
404201201_37_a
but now we can access subquests
on Thule that are centered around
Athena and Greek mythology.
Yui
404201201_36_a
Leafa
404201201_35_a
Kirito
404201201_34_a
It seems that this specific event
has come to an end,
Yui
404201201_33_a
Sinon
404201201_32_a
Yuuki
404201201_31_a
So...what does this mean?
Asuna
404201201_30_a
Then I will determine if we must
ultimately fight one another.
Athena
404201201_29_a
I will stay in this world
and observe the fairies
a while longer.
Athena
404201201_28_a
However...this does not change
what has happened.
Athena
404201201_27_a
Yuuki
404201201_26_a
Asuna
404201201_25_a
Leave it to a goddess to
understand without any
of us saying a word.
Sinon
404201201_24_a
Yui
404201201_23_a
Leafa
404201201_22_a
Kirito
404201201_21_a
I sense kindness within you as
well. Your hearts are not full of
the Aesir's malice...
Athena
404201201_20_a
So you are sparing me?
Athena
404201201_19_a
...!
Athena
404201201_18_a
Yui
404201201_17_a
Leafa
404201201_16_a
Yeah, but I never had any
intention of "finishing" her.
She's a victim too, you know?
Kirito
404201201_15_a
Asuna
404201201_14_a
Sinon
404201201_13_a
Aww, Kirito, makes you kinda feel
bad for her, doesn't it...?
Yuuki
404201201_12_a
Kirito
404201201_9_a
It is a humiliating defeat...
But a defeat nonetheless...
Athena
404201201_8_a
Yui
404201201_11_a
Leafa
404201201_10_a
Now, finish me off...
I am your enemy, after all...
Athena
404201201_7_a
Athena...
Kirito
404201201_6_a
Even with my stolen lance, I did
not believe you could defeat me...
Athena
404201201_5_a
Yui
404201201_4_a
Leafa
404201201_3_a
Kirito
404201201_2_a
bg_02_forest
Hngh...!
pant
... 
pant
...
Athena
404201201_1_a
Alright, time to win this rematch!
Asuna
404201101_59_a
Yuuki
404201101_58_a
Asuna
404201101_57_a
We've got her on her back foot!
Now's our chance!
Sinon
404201101_56_a
Yui
404201101_55_a
Leafa
404201101_54_a
Kirito
404201101_53_a
N-No... It can't be!
Athena
404201101_52_a
item_event_athena_spear
Give us the power to defeat
Athena...!
Kirito
404201101_51_a
Yui
404201101_50_a
Leafa
404201101_49_a
A-Anyway, this lance isn't
going to use itself!
Kirito
404201101_48_a
Yuuki
404201101_47_a
Asuna
404201101_46_a
Hehe, maybe there's
hope for you as a thief yet.
Sinon
404201101_45_a
Yui
404201101_44_a
Leafa
404201101_43_a
That again?! It just felt like a
cool thing to say in the moment!
Kirito
404201101_42_a
Leafa
404201101_41_a
Kirito
404201101_40_a
But Daddy really did start acting
all sneaky back there! He even
said "Let's blow this joint!"
Yui
404201101_39_a
Asuna
404201101_38_a
Sinon
404201101_37_a
That's rich, coming from a
berserker Spriggan!
Yuuki
404201101_36_a
Leafa
404201101_35_a
Yui
404201101_34_a
Ha ha, you're as combat-crazy
as ever, Yuuki.
Kirito
404201101_33_a
Asuna
404201101_32_a
Sinon
404201101_31_a
Time to exact our revenge!
Yuuki
404201101_30_a
Asuna
404201101_29_a
Sinon
404201101_28_a
Yeah! Now that we've got the
lance, we won't get our butts
handed to us like last time!
Yuuki
404201101_27_a
Leafa
404201101_26_a
Yui
404201101_25_a
Guess not... Alright, let's do it!
Kirito
404201101_24_a
Sinon
404201101_23_a
Yuuki
404201101_22_a
They've got us surrounded... Looks
like there's no way out of this
but to fight our way through.
Asuna
404201101_21_a
Sinon
404201101_20_a
Asuna
404201101_19_a
Holy
! You weren't kidding!
I can't even count how many
of them there are!
Yuuki
404201101_18_a
Leafa
404201101_17_a
Yui
404201101_16_a
Kirito
404201101_15_a
Prepare to meet your doom!
Athena
404201101_14_a
But her and her entire army are
chasing after us... You think we
can handle all of them at once?
Kirito
404201101_13_a
Now that we have this lance,
we can face Athena on a more
level playing field.
Leafa
404201101_12_a
Well, at least you didn't leave
empty-handed.
Leafa
404201101_11_a
I got the lance all right, but
her guards spotted us. They
were right on our heels!
Kirito
404201101_9_a
Yui
404201101_10_a
Sinon
404201101_8_a
Asuna
404201101_7_a
So how'd it go?
Yuuki
404201101_6_a
Yui
404201101_5_a
Asuna! Guys!
Kirito
404201101_4_a
Yuuki
404201101_3_a
Sinon
404201101_2_a
bg_02_forest
Kirito!
Asuna
404201101_1_a
Crap! We have to focus on
getting out of this temple so we
can join back up with the others!
Kirito
404201001_19_a
There they are!
Seize them!
Scout
404201001_18_a
Seriously?!
Worry about that later!
Kirito
404201001_17_a
Are you a criminal, Daddy?
Yui
404201001_16_a
And it seems to be mostly used
by criminals after they've done
something bad.
Yui
404201001_15_a
But Daddy, I researched that turn
of phrase...
Yui
404201001_14_a
W-Well, yeah, but this isn't
really the time to ask me
about it!
Kirito
404201001_13_a
Daddy, when you said "let's
blow this joint," you meant
"let's run away," right?
Yui
404201001_12_a
This way, Yui! It should lead
us straight to the exit!
Kirito
404201001_11_a
Capture them!
Athena
404201001_10_a
Inform to the whole army!
My temple is invaded by rioters
Athena
404201001_9_a
My lance...!
Tch...!
Athena
404201001_8_a
Okay!
Yui
404201001_7_a
Let's blow this joint, Yui!
Kirito
404201001_6_a
Tch...!
But she can't do anything
without this lance!
Kirito
404201001_5_a
Daddy, she knows you're there!
Yui
404201001_4_a
Who goes there?!
Athena
404201001_3_a
Yui
404201001_2_a
item_event_athena_spear
bg_event_temple
Got it!
Kirito
404201001_1_a
Great, now's our chance!
That lance's ours for the taking!
Kirito
404200901_25_a
It's leaning against that wall!
Yui
404200901_24_a
Hold on... If she's, uh, exposed
right now...then where's the
lance?
Kirito
404200901_23_a
I-I'm only trying to figure out
what's going on...
Kirito
404200901_22_a
Daddy, you shouldn't stare!
Yui
404200901_21_a
B-But why?! Is she taking
a bath or something?
Kirito
404200901_20_a
Yui
404200901_19_a
W-Wait, is she naked...?!
Kirito
404200901_18_a
I have heard bathing in these
natural hot springs does wonders
for one's body.
Athena
404200901_17_a
Yes, it is perfect. There are some
benefits to coming to this distant
land, I suppose...
Athena
404200901_16_a
Is the temperature to your
liking, Lady Athena?
???
404200901_15_a
Yui
404200901_14_a
Do you hear...water?
Kirito
404200901_13_a
Right then, let's check it out...
Kirito
404200901_12_a
Daddy, that's the room!
Yui
404200901_11_a
That must mean there's
at least one opening for
us to steal the lance.
Kirito
404200901_10_a
They must have been some
sort of player-activated flag
for this event.
Kirito
404200901_9_a
And I guess I should thank those
loud-mouth scouts Asuna and Leafa
overheard if I see them.
Kirito
404200901_8_a
Thanks, Yui.
Kirito
404200901_7_a
That's most likely Athena's room.
Yui
404200901_6_a
According to the map,
there's a large room
deep within the dungeon.
Yui
404200901_5_a
I don't think I have to worry
about being discovered now.
Kirito
404200901_4_a
Yeah... My hiding spell
just kicked in.
Kirito
404200901_3_a
Kirito
404200901_2_a
bg_event_temple
Daddy, are you okay?
Yui
404200901_1_a
M-Might as well give it a shot...
Kirito
404200801_47_a
Are you sure about this, Kirito?
Asuna
404200801_46_a
Asuna
404200801_45_a
Yui
404200801_44_a
That again?! Ugh...
Still, though... That might
be the only way...
Kirito
404200801_43_a
Yuuki
404200801_42_a
Leafa
404200801_41_a
This could be your shining moment
to prove you're a worthy member
of your race.
Sinon
404200801_40_a
Hehe, yeah. How about it, Kirito?
Sinon
404200801_39_a
Leafa
404200801_38_a
Sinon
404200801_37_a
Heh, bringing up our earlier
conversation, huh?
Yuuki
404200801_36_a
Kirito
404200801_35_a
Asuna
404200801_34_a
No, Daddy! This is the perfect time
to channel your inner Spriggan!
Yui
404200801_33_a
Basically channel our
inner cat burglar, huh?
Kirito
404200801_32_a
Yui
404200801_31_a
Kirito
404200801_30_a
We could sneak into the temple,
wait for her to put it down, then
grab it and run for our lives?
Asuna
404200801_29_a
Sinon
404200801_28_a
Yuuki
404200801_27_a
G-Good point...
Anyone have any ideas?
Leafa
404200801_26_a
But how are we going to do that
without defeating her first?
Sinon
404200801_25_a
Yuuki
404200801_24_a
Leafa
404200801_23_a
So that means we need
to steal it somehow.
Sinon
404200801_22_a
Asuna
404200801_21_a
Yui
404200801_20_a
That is some badass weapon...
Kirito
404200801_19_a
It seems like that lance Athena
wields is the source of her power.
Asuna
404200801_18_a
Yui
404200801_17_a
Kirito
404200801_16_a
We eavesdropped on some NPCs
that looked like scouts.
Asuna
404200801_15_a
Yuuki
404200801_14_a
Leafa
404200801_13_a
How?
Sinon
404200801_12_a
We found out something that
could help us defeat Athena!
Leafa
404200801_11_a
Yuuki
404200801_9_a
We were totally fine.
But hey, listen to this!
Leafa
404200801_8_a
Sinon
404200801_10_a
Yui
404200801_7_a
Kirito
404200801_6_a
You too.
Asuna
404200801_5_a
Yui
404200801_4_a
Glad to see you're both
safe and sound.
Kirito
404200801_3_a
Sinon
404200801_2_a
bg_02_forest
Hey, there they are!
Asuna, Leafa!
Yuuki
404200801_1_a
It seems that way. We have to
hurry and find Kirito and the
others so we can tell them!
Asuna
404200701_21_a
So Athena's lance must be the
key to winning this...
Leafa
404200701_20_a
Leafa
404200701_19_a
...
Asuna
404200701_18_a
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Scout B
404200701_17_a
We must take every precaution
to ensure that lance remains
in her possession.
Scout A
404200701_16_a
In a way, you could say that
lance is more of a double-edged
sword for her...
Scout A
404200701_15_a
But that is only because
Lord Zeus gifted her that lance.
Scout A
404200701_14_a
Do not get complacent!
Lady Athena's powers may
be boundless...
Scout A
404200701_13_a
Yeah! The likes of those savage
Aesir peons are nothing compared
to her!
Scout C
404200701_12_a
Not when we have the great and
powerful Athena on our side.
Scout B
404200701_11_a
Alright. There's really no cause
for great concern, though,
is there?
Scout B
404200701_10_a
It looks like those fairies came
through here. Spread out and
find them.
Scout A
404200701_9_a
Leafa
404200701_8_a
Totally... They must be out
scouting...
Asuna
404200701_7_a
They look like Athena's
assassins...
Leafa
404200701_6_a
Right...
Oh! Leafa!
Over there!
Asuna
404200701_5_a
Let's try not to get caught by
Athena's assassins before we
can find them again...
Leafa
404200701_4_a
Yeah... But they can't be too far.
Leafa
404200701_3_a
Leafa
404200701_2_a
bg_03_forest1
I think we lost Kirito
and the others...
Asuna
404200701_1_a
Yui
404200601_31_a
Yeah, yeah, sorry I'm so useless.
Kirito
404200601_30_a
Sinon
404200601_29_a
Ahahaha, she's totally got
your number, Kirito.
Yuuki
404200601_28_a
Yuuki
404200601_27_a
Oh, you don't say?
Sinon
404200601_26_a
Kirito
404200601_25_a
He's not very adept at playing to
his Spriggan strengths.
Yui
404200601_24_a
Daddy's the kind of person who
wants to fight even the strongest
enemy, Sinon.
Yui
404200601_23_a
Yui
404200601_22_a
Um, well, about that...
Kirito
404200601_21_a
Yuuki
404200601_20_a
Hey, I thought Spriggans were
supposed to be good at sneaking
around undetected.
Sinon
404200601_19_a
Yeah. We gotta stay vigilant.
Yuuki
404200601_18_a
If they find us, we might not be
able to fend them off...
Sinon
404200601_17_a
Yuuki
404200601_16_a
We better be extra careful
with all of Athena's assassins
lurking around.
Sinon
404200601_15_a
Yui
404200601_14_a
Ah, crap... Well, they have to
be somewhere on this island.
Let's go find them.
Kirito
404200601_13_a
Daddy, I think we lost
Mommy and Leafa.
Yui
404200601_12_a
Then there must be some sort of
trick to winning this...
Kirito
404200601_9_a
Sinon
404200601_11_a
Yuuki
404200601_10_a
Yeah. I feel like she'd still win
even if every last player banded
together against her.
Sinon
404200601_8_a
You can say that again. At this
point you gotta wonder if it's
even possible to take her down.
Yuuki
404200601_7_a
Her stats are insane. Nothing
we do to her leaves so much
as a scratch.
Kirito
404200601_6_a
Well, I guess she isn't the
goddess of war for nothing...
Kirito
404200601_5_a
Seriously... We never stood
a chance...
Sinon
404200601_4_a
Yuuki
404200601_3_a
Sinon
404200601_2_a
bg_02_forest
Ugh, that sucked...
Kirito
404200601_1_a
Hehe, I'm itching for some action!
Yuuki
404200501_44_a
Bring it on!
Leafa
404200501_43_a
Leafa
404200501_42_a
Yuuki
404200501_41_a
Seems like diplomacy isn't going
to get us anywhere... Fine, we'll
just have to duke it out!
Kirito
404200501_40_a
Sinon
404200501_39_a
She's not backing down...
Asuna
404200501_38_a
Leafa
404200501_37_a
Yuuki
404200501_36_a
bg_event_temple
Whoa!
Kirito
404200501_35_a
bg_black
Hragh!
Athena
404200501_34_a
Leafa
404200501_33_a
Yuuki
404200501_32_a
Kirito
404200501_31_a
You fairies will pay the price
for serving those gods! Behold
our power!
Athena
404200501_30_a
Asuna
404200501_29_a
Well, there are plenty of
hot-blooded Norse gods
with humanlike vices...
Sinon
404200501_28_a
Leafa
404200501_27_a
Yuuki
404200501_26_a
He told us not to trust the Aesir.
Maybe this is what he was
talking about.
Kirito
404200501_25_a
Leafa
404200501_24_a
Yuuki
404200501_23_a
Remember what Thrymr said back
in Thrymheim?
Kirito
404200501_22_a
Sinon
404200501_21_a
Maybe that means we fairies
are just caught in the crossfire
of a war between the gods...
Asuna
404200501_20_a
Yuuki
404200501_19_a
Kirito
404200501_18_a
Well, it's not like WE were the
ones who attacked them!
Leafa
404200501_17_a
Asuna
404200501_16_a
That makes sense. They were
attacked first, and now they're
retaliating.
Sinon
404200501_15_a
Leafa
404200501_14_a
Yuuki
404200501_13_a
The Aesir...?
Those are the Norse gods!
Kirito
404200501_12_a
we have launched this assault
on your world.
Athena
404200501_11_a
Such actions are tantamount to
a declaration of war. In order to
protect ourselves,
Athena
404200501_10_a
The Aesir have trespassed upon
our domain.
Athena
404200501_9_a
I am Athena, guardian of
the metropolis.
???
404200501_8_a
I think you're right. She
definitely looks the part
of a goddess...
Leafa
404200501_7_a
Hey, that's gotta be Athena!
Yuuki
404200501_6_a
...!
Kirito
404200501_5_a
Leafa
404200501_4_a
Yuuki
404200501_3_a
Kirito
404200501_2_a
bg_event_temple
You...
???
404200501_1_a
Then off we go!
Yuuki
404200401_45_a
Yuuki
404200401_44_a
Sinon
404200401_43_a
Yeah! We might even find out
why Athena's invading.
Leafa
404200401_42_a
Kirito
404200401_41_a
Well, right now we should go
check out that temple.
Asuna
404200401_40_a
Leafa
404200401_39_a
Yuuki
404200401_38_a
There's no arguing that...
Sinon
404200401_37_a
Asuna
404200401_36_a
For now, Athena's our enemy.
The only thing we can do
is fight her...
Kirito
404200401_35_a
Asuna
404200401_34_a
You're right... But he's not the
one who's invading ALO.
Kirito
404200401_33_a
Yuuki
404200401_32_a
Sinon
404200401_31_a
If anything, her brother Ares is
the more violent of the two...
Leafa
404200401_30_a
Kirito
404200401_29_a
Yeah. I've always thought of her
as a benevolent goddess...
Asuna
404200401_28_a
Leafa
404200401_27_a
Yuuki
404200401_26_a
It's true she's known as a goddess
of war, but she's also even-tempered
and wouldn't attack unprovoked...
Sinon
404200401_25_a
Leafa
404200401_24_a
Yuuki
404200401_23_a
Athena was the guardian deity of
the ancient Greek capital, right?
Sinon
404200401_22_a
Asuna
404200401_21_a
What is, Sinon?
Kirito
404200401_20_a
Leafa
404200401_19_a
Yuuki
404200401_18_a
Strange...
Sinon
404200401_17_a
Kirito
404200401_16_a
That wasn't here before...
Asuna
404200401_15_a
Leafa
404200401_14_a
Yuuki
404200401_13_a
That's a pretty impressive temple.
It looks like the one I read about
where Athena supposedly lives.
Sinon
404200401_12_a
Whoa! What is that, a palace?!
Yuuki
404200401_9_a
Sinon
404200401_11_a
Leafa
404200401_10_a
Asuna
404200401_8_a
Yeah. And if you need any
further proof, look at the
top of that hill.
Kirito
404200401_7_a
Yuuki
404200401_6_a
Sinon
404200401_5_a
The name alone sounds very Greek,
huh? I guess it'd be a fitting
place for Athena to set up camp...
Leafa
404200401_4_a
Yuuki
404200401_3_a
Sinon
404200401_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Aah, okay... There are legends
that speak of an island in
northern Europe called Thule...
Leafa
404200401_1_a
Yuuki
404200301_34_a
Sinon
404200301_33_a
You two figure something out?
Leafa
404200301_32_a
Asuna
404200301_31_a
Oh!
Kirito
404200301_30_a
Yeah...
Kirito
404200301_29_a
They all fell towards the southern
seas, didn't they?
Asuna
404200301_28_a
Asuna
404200301_27_a
Greek mythology...
Shooting stars...
Kirito
404200301_26_a
Leafa
404200301_25_a
Yuuki
404200301_24_a
But we don't have a single clue...
Are we just supposed to wander
around and hope we run into her?
Sinon
404200301_23_a
Maybe that comes later?
Leafa
404200301_22_a
Yuuki
404200301_21_a
Sinon
404200301_20_a
Not even anything about having
to look for her.
Leafa
404200301_19_a
Asuna
404200301_18_a
True. There wasn't anything in the
quest description about that...
Kirito
404200301_17_a
Leafa
404200301_16_a
Yuuki
404200301_15_a
How are we going to find Athena?
Defeating her is the ultimate
goal, after all.
Sinon
404200301_14_a
It's lucky they spawn like this so
we don't have to go hunting
all over for them, but...
Sinon
404200301_13_a
Sinon
404200301_12_a
Leafa
404200301_11_a
Looks like it. Maaan, that thing
was strong!
Yuuki
404200301_10_a
Kirito
404200301_9_a
That was one of Athena's
assassins, wasn't it?
Asuna
404200301_8_a
Sinon
404200301_7_a
Yuuki
404200301_6_a
Leafa
404200301_5_a
Graaawwwr!
Monster
404200301_4_a
Sinon
404200301_3_a
Yuuki
404200301_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
Hyaaaa!
Leafa
404200301_1_a
The goal is to defeat those
assassins and then banish Athena
back to the realm of the gods.
Yui
404200201_40_a
Kirito
404200201_39_a
Asuna
404200201_38_a
Yes, and she's unleashing
assassins into ALO.
Yui
404200201_37_a
Yuuki
404200201_36_a
Leafa
404200201_35_a
The Greek goddess of war is
Athena, right?
Sinon
404200201_34_a
Asuna
404200201_33_a
Yui
404200201_32_a
There were lots of traditions they
drew from to make ALO, though
Norse mythology's their main well.
Kirito
404200201_31_a
Sinon
404200201_30_a
Yuuki
404200201_29_a
Guess they're branching out
from Norse mythology.
Leafa
404200201_28_a
Kirito
404200201_27_a
Asuna
404200201_26_a
It appears the theme centers
around Greek mythology.
Yui
404200201_25_a
A goddess, huh?
Kirito
404200201_24_a
Yes, event name is 
"Meteor Showers the Goddess of Battle"
Yui
404200201_23_a
M-More importantly, Yui, can you
tell us what's going on?
Kirito
404200201_22_a
Yui
404200201_21_a
Kirito
404200201_20_a
Huh?!
Um... Well, I...
Asuna
404200201_19_a
Yuuki
404200201_18_a
Leafa
404200201_17_a
By yourself?
Sinon
404200201_16_a
Sinon
404200201_15_a
Yuuki
404200201_14_a
Oh, you saw them too?
Leafa
404200201_13_a
Yui
404200201_12_a
Kirito
404200201_11_a
Yeah, it was almost scary how
many there were.
Asuna
404200201_10_a
Leafa
404200201_9_a
Sinon
404200201_8_a
Those were AMAZING! I've never
seen so many at once!
Yuuki
404200201_7_a
Asuna
404200201_6_a
Yui
404200201_5_a
Let me guess, it has to do
with those shooting stars
from last night.
Kirito
404200201_4_a
Kirito

bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Everyone, a brand new event
just started!
Yui
404200201_1_a
You're right... I wonder if this
is some sort of event...
Kirito
404200101_23_a
They're falling towards
the southern seas...
Asuna
404200101_22_a
Y-Yeah... Like something you'd
see at the end of the world...
Kirito
404200101_21_a
I can't believe how many of
them there are! It's actually
kind of frightening...
Asuna
404200101_20_a
Shooting stars?!
Or are those comets?
Kirito
404200101_19_a
Kirito, look!
Asuna
404200101_18_a
Waaah!
Wh-What happened?!
Kirito
404200101_17_a
Kirito
404200101_16_a
Aaaah!
Asuna
404200101_15_a
Kirito...
Asuna
404200101_14_a
Same here...
Asuna...
Kirito
404200101_13_a
I'm really glad we got to
look at the stars together
again like this...
Asuna
404200101_12_a
Yeah...
Kirito...
Asuna
404200101_11_a
Ha ha... You're talking about that
promise we made in SAO...
Kirito
404200101_10_a
Oh, me too! Hehe, but doesn't
this remind you of anything else,
Kirito?
Asuna
404200101_9_a
Yeah... You know, I remember
doing a science project on space
one summer when I was younger.
Kirito
404200101_8_a
you still have to go somewhere
like Mount Dodaira to get a good
look at anything.
Asuna
404200101_7_a
Hehe, you're right. Even
though it's the perfect time
of year for stargazing,
Asuna
404200101_6_a
You can hardly even see the
stars in the real world with all
the light pollution.
Kirito
404200101_5_a
Stargazing really is better in VR.
Kirito
404200101_4_a
Yeah, they are.
Kirito
404200101_3_a
Kirito
404200101_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
Wow... The stars are so pretty
tonight...
Asuna
404200101_1_a
You bet!
Kirito
404101201_57_a
Until they return to their world,
let's do whatever we can to
help them out.
Asuna
404101201_56_a
Yeah, I think so too!
They're both really nice.
Asuna
404101201_55_a
I say we should team up with
Alice and Eugeo for now.
Kirito
404101201_54_a
It's that they're good people!
I want to help them both out
somehow.
Kirito
404101201_53_a
Yeah. And if there's just one
thing I can say for sure
about those two...
Kirito
404101201_52_a
Ha ha! I know what you mean...
Something about them makes me
feel like we met for a reason.
Asuna
404101201_51_a
This is the kind of experience you
could only access through a
virtual world!
Kirito
404101201_50_a
Fighting alongside these berserk
warriors from another world...
Kirito
404101201_49_a
The fact that we even met these
two... Doesn't it feel like a
miracle to you?
Kirito
404101201_48_a
What?
Asuna
404101201_47_a
Besides...isn't that the
coolest thing ever?
Kirito
404101201_46_a
Right!
Asuna
404101201_45_a
Because no matter how you look at
it, they're people in this world,
and right now they need our help.
Kirito
404101201_44_a
So we assume they're living,
breathing humans who wandered here
from another world? Okay...
Kirito
404101201_43_a
Well, they could be an experimental
player-simulation... But let's go
with this explanation for now.
Asuna
404101201_42_a
Ahaha! You have a point.
Asuna
404101201_41_a
How many times have we had
visitors wandering in from some
other world or timeline?
Kirito
404101201_40_a
If that's the work of artificial
intelligence, it's beyond anything
I've ever seen before.
Kirito
404101201_39_a
Totally. And with responses as
complex as theirs, they're almost
indistinguishable from players.
Kirito
404101201_38_a
They act like they're from a
completely different reality
from us...
Asuna
404101201_37_a
I get that same feeling. It isn't
even like they're from another
virtual world.
Asuna
404101201_36_a
It's almost as though they came
from a world that we don't even
know about.
Kirito
404101201_35_a
That's definitely not
Nibelheim, then...
Kirito
404101201_34_a
I guess so. She said that there's
a peaceful Human Empire and a Dark
Territory full of their enemies.
Kirito
404101201_33_a
Based on what she's told us so
far, that doesn't sound like
Alice's world to me.
Asuna
404101201_32_a
But Nibelheim is the home of the
Frost Giants. There's nothing
there but icy wastelands...
Asuna
404101201_31_a
That would mean they're from a
lower realm than Jotunheimr.
Maybe Nibelheim?
Kirito
404101201_30_a
They both say that a bright light
brought them here. Maybe
they came out of Urdr's spring.
Kirito
404101201_29_a
Who are those two...? Or maybe
I should say "what" are they...
Asuna
404101201_28_a
Asuna
404101201_27_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
...
Kirito
404101201_26_a
Thanks! That'd be a great help.
Sinon
404101201_25_a
Oh! Let me help! I've got a big,
simple map of everywhere
in ALO on me right now.
Leafa
404101201_24_a
Alice, Eugeo? Can you
come over here?
Sinon
404101201_23_a
Leafa
404101201_22_a
Yes, that's right. Maybe I should
explain from the beginning.
Sinon
404101201_21_a
Does that mean this world
really is underground?
Alice
404101201_20_a
Eugeo
404101201_19_a
The surface... You mentioned that
before, didn't you?
Alice
404101201_18_a
Leafa
404101201_17_a
Now that we've taken out the
enemies in this lower realm, we
should head back to the surface.
Sinon
404101201_16_a
Yui
404101201_15_a
Ah... Yeah, sure.
Kirito
404101201_14_a
Kirito, I thought we might bring
them to stay in our log cabin.
What do you think?
Asuna
404101201_13_a
Yui
404101201_12_a
Kirito
404101201_11_a
Well, I guess you two will need
somewhere to stay.
Asuna
404101201_10_a
...
Alice
404101201_9_a
I want to see that promise through.
Eugeo
404101201_8_a
Alice
404101201_7_a
I'll stay here too. I gave
that goddess my word as
an Integrity Knight.
Eugeo
404101201_6_a
Asuna
404101201_5_a
Yui
404101201_4_a
I see...
Kirito
404101201_3_a
Eugeo
404101201_2_a
bg_04_field_flower_snow
I made a promise to recover all of
the Divine Objects... I will
remain in this realm until I do.
Alice
404101201_1_a
Leafa
404101101_36_a
Yeah! If it wasn't for you two,
we'd all be monster chow right
now!
Sinon
404101101_35_a
Yui
404101101_34_a
Kirito
404101101_33_a
Hahaha! Anyway, we couldn't
have made it back there
without your help!
Asuna
404101101_32_a
Leafa
404101101_31_a
Oh! Uh, nothing!
Nothing at all. Hehe...
Kirito
404101101_30_a
Eugeo
404101101_29_a
What are you two
whispering about?
Alice
404101101_28_a
Are you sure...? But wait! We're
not finished. There are still six
Divine Objects left, aren't there?
Leafa
404101101_27_a
Yeah... But I don't think
those two are NPCs.
Kirito
404101101_26_a
NPCs aren't supposed to hang
around after you finish an event
quest, right?
Leafa
404101101_25_a
Wh-What? What is it, Sugu?
Yeesh, don't pull my ears
when you whisper...
Kirito
404101101_24_a
Kirito
404101101_23_a
...Hey, Kirito.
Leafa
404101101_22_a
Asuna
404101101_21_a
Yui
404101101_20_a
Oh! Sorry... Allow me to
explain...um, again.
Kirito
404101101_19_a
Alice
404101101_18_a
What a complicated dialect
you all speak here...
Eugeo
404101101_17_a
And this notification says we've
completed the quest.
Yui
404101101_16_a
Asuna
404101101_15_a
Kirito
404101101_14_a
Yes. It doesn't look like any
more are going to spawn here.
Yui
404101101_13_a
Leafa
404101101_12_a
It seems that we defeated all
the monsters in this area in
that battle, too.
Sinon
404101101_11_a
Kirito
404101101_9_a
So these monsters had
stolen it! Good thing
we got it back.
Asuna
404101101_8_a
Yui
404101101_10_a
Eugeo
404101101_7_a
Yes. One down, six to go.
Alice
404101101_6_a
Yui
404101101_5_a
Asuna
404101101_4_a
Huh? That's what Urdr wanted
you to find?
Kirito
404101101_3_a
Eugeo
404101101_2_a
item_event_sacred_treasure
bg_04_field_flower_snow
Just like the goddess said...
it's a Divine Object!
Alice
404101101_1_a
Alice
404101001_55_a
Okay!
Eugeo
404101001_54_a
You can lend me a hand!
Kirito
404101001_53_a
Yui
404101001_52_a
Asuna
404101001_51_a
...Alright! I understand!
Kirito
404101001_50_a
I just...
Eugeo
404101001_49_a
And it's not just that. Something
about fighting alongside you makes
me feel...happy.
Eugeo
404101001_48_a
Alice
404101001_47_a
You saw me back there, didn't
you? I'm no weakling.
Eugeo
404101001_46_a
Yui
404101001_45_a
Asuna
404101001_44_a
What?
Kirito
404101001_43_a
Alice
404101001_42_a
No! I'll fight too!
Eugeo
404101001_41_a
Yui
404101001_40_a
Asuna
404101001_39_a
You said it!
Stay back, Eugeo!
We've got this!
Kirito
404101001_38_a
We can worry about this guy's
backstory after we take care
of these guys!
Sinon
404101001_37_a
Sinon
404101001_36_a
It looks like we're up against
the main forces this time!
Leafa
404101001_35_a
Yui
404101001_34_a
More monsters?!
Asuna
404101001_33_a
GRAAUUGH!!
Monster
404101001_32_a
Yui

Kirito
404101001_29_a
Ggruuuruu!
Amayori
404101001_28_a
Even I don't know a Thirty-Two...
I'd like to get to the bottom of
this, but we don't have time now.
Alice
404101001_27_a
Eugeo
404101001_26_a
No... He must be another one
the goddess chose as a helper.
Alice
404101001_25_a
Yui
404101001_24_a
Alice, you don't know who Eugeo
is either, do you?
Asuna
404101001_23_a
Yui
404101001_22_a
Asuna
404101001_21_a
So you've really lost all your
memories? What could have
happened to you...?
Kirito
404101001_20_a
Alice
404101001_19_a
That's right.
Eugeo
404101001_18_a
Yui
404101001_17_a
Asuna
404101001_16_a
bg_04_field_flower_snow
So that's the only thing
you can remember?
Kirito
404101001_15_a
Wait. No... You're not the one
I need to protect...! Who...
are you?
Eugeo
404101001_14_a
Thank goodness, I made it back...
Eugeo

You...!
Urdr
404101001_11_a
Where did they go? Maybe if I keep
walking this way...I can make
it back...
Eugeo
404101001_10_a
What is this? It's like a world
of hazy light...
Eugeo
404101001_9_a
...
Eugeo
404101001_8_a
...I am...
Eugeo

Welcome...

And I am...an Integrity Knight.
Eugeo Synthesis Thirty-Two.
Eugeo
404100901_38_a
No, that's not it... But there's
an important person I'm
supposed to protect.
Eugeo
404100901_37_a
But I know I have to protect
the one who accepted me...
Mother...?
Eugeo
404100901_36_a
I'm sorry...
My memory's a bit foggy.
Eugeo
404100901_35_a
What... What are
you talking about?
Eugeo
404100901_34_a
Eugeo
404100901_33_a
Oh...! Then this Integrity Knight
must be the second one that Urdr
sent on this mission?
Alice
404100901_32_a
Leafa
404100901_31_a
Wait. Didn't you say that the
goddess Urdr was putting together
a band of able warriors?
Sinon
404100901_30_a
Eugeo
404100901_29_a
No. I've never seen
this man before...
Alice
404100901_28_a
Yui
404100901_27_a
Kirito
404100901_26_a
So, then...Eugeo and Alice
already know each other?
Asuna
404100901_25_a
Does that mean you're a new
Integrity Knight?
Alice
404100901_24_a
Wh-What did you just say?
Synthesis Thirty-Two?!
Alice
404100901_23_a

Eugeo Synthesis Thirty-Two....

My name is...

404100901_16_a
Hm...? Who's that?
Alice
404100901_15_a
Looks like we've cleaned
out this area.
Alice
404100901_14_a
Alice
404100901_13_a
Grruugh!
Amayori
404100901_12_a
Sinon
404100901_11_a
And in that blue armor...
didn't he look a little
like Alice to you?
Leafa
404100901_10_a
Leafa
404100901_9_a
It looked like a guy. Probably
just a little older than Kirito.
Sinon
404100901_8_a
Yui
404100901_7_a
Kirito
404100901_6_a
Who's the one who stepped
in to save Kirito...?

GRAAAUGH!!!
Monster
404100801_40_a
Seriously?!
Kirito
404100801_39_a
This one is even stronger than
the ones that Alice defeated
the other day!
Yui
404100801_38_a
Daddy! According to
the database...
Yui
404100801_37_a
Dammit...! This difficulty level
has to be a mistake, right?!

for a live commentary!

That's way beyond the realm of 
regular sword skills, huh?
Leafa

Yui
404100801_28_a
Yeah... Nothing stands a chance
against those techniques.
Kirito

Look at Alice... She's amazing!

But be warned... If you can't
keep up with me and Amayori,
you'll get left behind!
Alice
404100801_15_a
Come along if you wish.
Alice
404100801_14_a
So in this world, you call the
Forces of Darkness "monsters"...
Very well.
Alice
404100801_13_a
Asuna
404100801_12_a
If you're taking down monsters,
you're in good company with us!
Kirito

What'd we just tell you after
our little spar back there?

H-Hey! Wait for us!
Kirito
404100801_4_a
What's that, Amayori?
You spotted more enemies...?
Here we go again...
Alice
404100801_3_a
Alice
404100801_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Kgroouu!!
Grauuu!
Amayori
404100801_1_a
It sounds like Amayori
is back from scouting...
That's my dragon.
Alice
404100701_42_a
Asuna
404100701_41_a
What was that?
Kirito
404100701_40_a
Yui
404100701_39_a
Kirito
404100701_38_a
Asuna
404100701_37_a
Grrauuu!!
???
404100701_36_a
But unless we find them and get
back to our world soon...
Alice
404100701_35_a
What a shame...
I heard a rumor that I might
find one in this area.
Alice
404100701_34_a
Yui
404100701_33_a
Asuna
404100701_32_a
Sorry we can't help that much.
We don't know anything
about them either...
Kirito
404100701_31_a
With them missing, I didn't really
have much of a choice but to agree
to help the goddess.
Alice
404100701_30_a
In my world, Divine Objects are a
set of extremely precious weapons
and armor.
Alice
404100701_29_a
Yui
404100701_28_a
Kirito
404100701_27_a
Me neither... I know about the
"Legendary" and "Ancient" item
classes, but this is a new one...
Asuna
404100701_26_a
Sinon
404100701_25_a
Divine Objects...?
I haven't even heard of
that item class before.
Leafa
404100701_24_a
So do you know anything about
these Divine Objects or not?
Alice
404100701_23_a
Yui
404100701_22_a
Asuna
404100701_21_a
Maybe...
Alice is...
Kirito
404100701_20_a
Leafa
404100701_19_a
No kidding. You'd never mistake
her for a regular NPC...
Sinon
404100701_18_a
Yui
404100701_17_a
But coming up with this level of
detail for a minor character's
backstory is just insane.
Kirito
404100701_16_a
If Alice really is an NPC, she
must be describing the scenario
for an event quest...
Kirito
404100701_15_a
Yui
404100701_14_a
Kirito
404100701_13_a
K-Kirito... What's going on?
Asuna
404100701_12_a
And to find warriors strong
enough to destroy the brutes
disturbing her realm.
Alice
404100701_11_a
The Goddess of the Spring asked me
to gather the seven Divine Objects
spread throughout this world...
Alice
404100701_10_a
Asuna
404100701_9_a
Yui
404100701_8_a
Uh, yeah, we do.
Kirito
404100701_7_a
...So I take it you know this
goddess I speak of.
Alice
404100701_6_a
Sinon
404100701_5_a
So Urdr asked you to come here
and wipe out the Forces of
Darkness... Is that right?
Leafa
404100701_4_a
Asuna
404100701_3_a
Yui
404100701_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
What...?
Kirito
404100701_1_a
y66
Please work with them
to save this realm.
Urdr
404100601_55_a
y66
I wish for you to gather
a band of warriors as
strong as yourself.
Urdr
404100601_54_a
x66
Then you will listen?
You have my thanks.
Urdr
404100601_53_a
Very well...
Goddess of this realm.
I will hear your request.
Alice
404100601_52_a
Perhaps she's a being on the
same level as the Goddess Stacia.
Alice
404100601_51_a
The form of this "Urdr" woman...
She really does look like a
goddess.
Alice
404100601_50_a
Amayori...
You're right.
Alice
404100601_49_a
Ggrauuu...
Amayori
404100601_48_a
...!
Alice
404100601_47_a
y66
Surely, you must be able to
appreciate the truth of what
I say to you.
Urdr
404100601_46_a
y66
You are a clearly a powerful knight
with a noble heart and a piercing
intellect...
Urdr
404100601_45_a
Enough! How dare you try to
deceive an Integrity Knight!
Alice
404100601_44_a
Gaahh! I don't understand any
of this! Are you trying to tell
me this is another world?
Alice
404100601_43_a
Nibelheim? But a moment ago
you said this place was called
Jotunheimr...
Alice
404100601_42_a
y66
Whatever do you mean? They are the
creatures from the world below
this one, a world called Nibelheim.
Urdr
404100601_41_a
Brutes?
You... You must mean the
Dark Territory, right?!
Alice
404100601_40_a
z66
I see... What a pity. I thought
I had finally found someone to
fell those wicked brutes...
Urdr
404100601_39_a
I... I'm sorry. I have something
else that I must do. I don't
have time for this.
Alice
404100601_38_a
y66
As it so happens, I presently
have need of a knight. Might
you listen to my plea?
Urdr
404100601_37_a
{66
I see... There's no doubt
about it. Surely you must
be a knight.
Urdr
404100601_36_a
{66
I sense in your being
a powerful will to fight...
Urdr
404100601_35_a
y66
Allow me to divine it, then.
Urdr
404100601_34_a
...
Alice
404100601_33_a
y66
And what is your nature, my child?
Urdr
404100601_32_a
Jotunheimr...?
Goddess of the Spring?
Alice
404100601_31_a
y66
I am Urdr, Goddess of the Spring
and Guardian of Jotunheimr.
Urdr
404100601_30_a
A giant woman...!
Just like the ones I've read
about in books of legends...!
Alice
404100601_29_a
y66
Urdr
404100601_28_a_1
Y-You're...!!
Alice
404100601_28_a
y66
Who might you be?
Urdr
404100601_27_a
Grauu...!
Amayori
404100601_26_a
bg_18_mountain
Let's rest at this spring for
a while, Amayori...
Alice
404100601_25_a
After a few days, I happened
upon a god of this world.
Alice
404100601_24_a
Right. So we kept walking, taking
down any beings that seemed like
agents of the Dark Territory...
Alice
404100601_23_a
Asuna
404100601_22_a
Yui
404100601_21_a
bg_11_forest_yui
So when you followed that light,
you ended up in our world?
Kirito
404100601_20_a
Where are we?!
Alice
404100601_19_a
What is this...?
Alice
404100601_18_a
Wh-What could this be?
This strange sensation of
being bathed in light...
Alice
404100601_17_a
Ggrauuu...
Amayori
404100601_16_a
bg_white
...
Alice
404100601_15_a
Then we have no choice.
We must land.
Alice
404100601_14_a
You don't know either, huh...
Alice
404100601_13_a
Ggruu.. Ggrouuuh!
Amayori
404100601_12_a
Amayori! Do you know
which way is home?!
Alice
404100601_11_a
All of a sudden, the air grew hazy.
Alice
404100601_10_a
bg_event_alo_cloudysky
What...?
What in the world is this?
Alice
404100601_9_a
Grroou!
Amayori
404100601_8_a
Let's take a little rest
on the ground.
Alice
404100601_7_a
What's wrong, girl?
Aww... You must be tired
from all that flying.
Alice
404100601_6_a
Grrroouh...
Amayori
404100601_5_a
Come on, Amayori.
We'd best get going.
Alice
404100601_4_a
And with that, the enemy
was no more.
Alice
404100601_3_a
Gwaaargh....!!
Dark Knight
404100601_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
Release Recollection!
Alice
404100601_1_a
But as soon as he saw me, he fled
well beyond the boundaries of the
Central Capital of Centoria.
Alice
404100501_43_a
No intruder had ever made it
so far into the capital. Sensing
danger, I went to approach him.
Alice
404100501_42_a
Then I saw an unmistakable
silhouette against the moonlight:
a Dark Knight riding dragon-back.
Alice
404100501_41_a
I was riding my dragon Amayori,
patrolling the skies above the
Central Cathedral.
Alice
404100501_40_a
It began like any other
night in Centoria.
Alice
404100501_39_a
Sinon
404100501_38_a
S-Sure...
Leafa
404100501_37_a
Asuna
404100501_36_a
Yui
404100501_35_a
Wait, Sugu. Don't interrupt.
Let's hear her out.
Kirito
404100501_34_a
Sinon
404100501_33_a
You do what for the who-now?
Leafa
404100501_32_a
Human Empire from the Dark
Territory, I serve under the
High Priest, the Administrator.
Alice

I am an Integrity Knight of the
Axiom Church in Centoria.

404100501_30_a
Very well.
Alice
404100501_29_a
...
Alice
404100501_28_a
Asuna
404100501_27_a
So how about we start over from
the beginning? Can you tell us
how you came here?
Kirito
404100501_26_a
Hey, Alice. It's true that we
can't understand everything
you're saying...
Kirito
404100501_25_a
...
Kirito
404100501_24_a
That's all I can determine from
our interactions so far...
Yui
404100501_23_a
M-More advanced than Yui...?
Is that even possible in ALO?
Asuna
404100501_22_a
To be honest...
She's even more advanced than me.
Yui
404100501_21_a
Kirito
404100501_20_a
Asuna
404100501_19_a
...Daddy, if she's an NPC,
then she's running
on non-standard AI.
Yui
404100501_18_a
And you still look as though
you don't trust me.
Alice
404100501_17_a
That may be true, but...you
said you do not understand
the words I use.
Alice
404100501_16_a
Sinon
404100501_15_a
So... I guess that
makes us allies!
Leafa
404100501_14_a
Sinon
404100501_13_a
We were thinking of taking on the
same mon
Err, I mean, the "Forces
of Darkness" that you defeated.
Leafa
404100501_12_a
Th-Thanks...
Asuna
404100501_9_a
Yui
404100501_11_a
Kirito
404100501_10_a
I'm still not sure I trust you...
But let's put away our weapons for
now. I don't sense malice in you.
Alice
404100501_8_a
Kirito
404100501_7_a
We don't want to fight you!
Asuna
404100501_6_a
S-Stop!
Alice, stop!
Asuna
404100501_5_a
Yui
404100501_4_a
Asuna
404100501_3_a
That was a gentle spar to you?!
Wow, no wonder you managed to
beat that quest by yourself...
Kirito
404100501_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
You're not from the Dark Territory.
A gentle spar can tell me that much
from your sword style, at least.
Alice
404100501_1_a
Very well... I admit defeat.
Alice
404100401_65_a
Yui
404100401_64_a
Asuna
404100401_63_a
Dammit... Nothing you're
saying makes sense!
Kirito
404100401_62_a
And you still haven't given me
any reason to trust you.
Alice
404100401_61_a
But those pointed ears of yours...
You certainly look like you're
from the Dark Territory.
Alice
404100401_60_a
Yui
404100401_59_a
Asuna
404100401_58_a
H-Hey, wait!
We're not your enemies...
I think!
Kirito
404100401_57_a
After a single battle, I'll be
able to tell whether you're
minions of the Dark Territory.
Alice
404100401_56_a
Yui
404100401_55_a
Asuna
404100401_54_a
What?!
Kirito
404100401_53_a
I hoped it wouldn't come to
this, but... So be it. We'll
have a trial by duel.
Alice
404100401_52_a
Yui
404100401_51_a
Asuna
404100401_50_a
Y-You can understand that too?
Kirito
404100401_49_a
...We're not getting anywhere
with this conversation, are we?
Alice
404100401_48_a
Yui
404100401_47_a
Asuna
404100401_46_a
Dark Territory...?
What's that?
Kirito
404100401_45_a
But as time went by, it seems they
simply surged forth again from
some other place.
Alice
404100401_44_a
It's true that Amayori and I were
able to fend off the forces of
the Dark Territory.
Alice
404100401_43_a
Asuna
404100401_42_a
Then she must be a player
after all... Or maybe...
Kirito
404100401_41_a
Yui
404100401_40_a
Asuna
404100401_39_a
R-Right... For an NPC, this
girl's reactions are extremely
complex...
Kirito
404100401_38_a
Leafa
404100401_37_a
Hey, Kirito...
Sinon
404100401_36_a
Yui
404100401_35_a
Asuna
404100401_34_a
...
Kirito
404100401_33_a
The light of the Sun God Solus
blesses this land. Surely this
is the surface.
Alice
404100401_32_a
The surface...?
What are you talking about?
Alice
404100401_31_a
Kirito
404100401_30_a
We heard that someone finally
defeated the monsters here, so we
came down to check it out.
Asuna
404100401_29_a
Oh! Um, we're sorry! We're, uh...
We're from the surface.
Asuna
404100401_28_a
Yui
404100401_27_a
Asuna
404100401_26_a
...!
Kirito
404100401_25_a
You've all been talking in some
strange code since I
first saw you... It's suspicious.
Alice
404100401_24_a
Yui
404100401_23_a
Kirito
404100401_22_a
Seems that way...
By the way, Alice,
where are you from?
Asuna
404100401_21_a
Yeah. She doesn't have wings,
and her design doesn't look
quite like an ALO avatar.
Leafa
404100401_20_a
Leafa
404100401_19_a
Ah, so she's an NPC.
Sinon
404100401_18_a
Yui

Asuna
404100401_16_a

Kirito
404100401_15_a
What in the world are
you talking about?
Alice
404100401_14_a
Diving...?
Alice
404100401_13_a
Leafa
404100401_12_a
Hey, Alice. How long have
you been diving?
Sinon
404100401_11_a
Well, we won't know unless we ask.

Yui

She... She's a player...right?
Asuna

Wow, cool! I've never seen an
avatar with a middle name in
ALO before.

Ah, we're sorry! My name is

Who goes there? You don't look like
you're of the Forces of Darkness,
but... State your business!

Wow...

404100301_33_a
Aha! There they are! So this is
that legendary player...
Or, um, NPC?

You're right!
Let's check it out.
Kirito
404100301_27_a
Leafa
404100301_26_a
Hey, look! There's smoke rising
from that direction. There's got
to be someone there, right?
Sinon
404100301_25_a
Yui
404100301_24_a
I'll say. And they must be
somewhere in these woods...
Kirito
404100301_23_a
Yui
404100301_22_a
Kirito
404100301_21_a
Whoever was strong enough to
take them all down must be
incredible.
Asuna
404100301_20_a
Leafa
404100301_19_a
Yeah. It's not so much that we
defeated the enemy but more that we
saw an opening and bravely ran away.
Sinon
404100301_18_a
Yui
404100301_17_a
Kirito
404100301_16_a
Yes way... It's a good thing we
were able to get out of that
wasteland, though.
Asuna

Sinon
404100301_14_a
Huh?!
No way!!
Leafa
404100301_13_a
I hate to bring bad news, but
that was only a tiny fraction
of the enemy army...
Yui

Ha ha! Well, if you
put it that way...

from that battle...
Sinon
404100301_7_a
Yui
404100301_6_a
Kirito
404100301_5_a
Hahaha! You say that, Sinonon,
but you're looking pretty worn
out yourself...
Asuna
404100301_4_a
Leafa... This is a VRMMO.
You can't get exhausted...
Sinon
404100301_3_a
Sinon
404100301_2_a
bg_08_forest
Ugh...
I'm so exhausted...
Leafa
404100301_1_a
Yeah!
Asuna
404100201_44_a
Yui
404100201_43_a
Asuna
404100201_42_a
Alright, guys!
Let's do this!
Kirito
404100201_41_a
Sinon
404100201_40_a
Thanks, Yui.
Leafa
404100201_39_a
I think the person we're
looking for could still
be around here.
Yui
404100201_38_a
Yes. It's just beyond this wasteland.
But you need to take out a monster
vanguard to get there.
Yui
404100201_37_a
You know where the
quest area is, right?
Asuna
404100201_36_a
Yui
404100201_35_a
Asuna
404100201_34_a
I thought the same thing. That's
one of the things I want to get
to the bottom of.
Kirito
404100201_33_a
Is that even possible? Either way,
I have a feeling they're trying to
let people know how to beat it.
Sinon
404100201_32_a
Leafa
404100201_31_a
But we don't even know who
those players could be...
Sinon
404100201_30_a
Yui
404100201_29_a
Kirito
404100201_28_a
That's true. There have got to
be players who have beaten the
event.
Asuna
404100201_27_a
But that means there's a connection
between players who've taken on the
quest and that NPC, right?
Sinon
404100201_26_a
Sinon
404100201_25_a
So the NPC beating the quest was
part of the storyline? Well,
I guess that's possible...
Leafa
404100201_24_a
Yui
404100201_23_a
Huh? You mean an NPC?
Asuna
404100201_22_a
Maybe it's not a player
we're dealing with.
Kirito
404100201_21_a
Yui
404100201_20_a
Asuna
404100201_19_a
That's what you'd expect from
most players. But maybe...
Kirito
404100201_18_a
But so far, nobody's taken credit.
Sinon
404100201_17_a
You'd think they wouldn't stop
bragging about it. Soon enough,
everyone would know.
Sinon
404100201_16_a
Leafa
404100201_15_a
It sure is odd. Think of the
players who usually clear
death-quests like this.
Sinon
404100201_14_a
Yui
404100201_13_a
Kirito
404100201_12_a
That's the plan.
Asuna
404100201_11_a
So you're trying to find the
mad genius who beat that
nightmare-quest?
Leafa
404100201_9_a
Sinon
404100201_10_a
Yui
404100201_8_a
It's good to see you, Leafa!
You too, Sinonon!
Asuna
404100201_7_a
Yui
404100201_6_a
Asuna
404100201_5_a
You two will be a real
big help today!
Kirito
404100201_4_a
It's been ages since I was
last in Jotunheimr.
Sinon
404100201_3_a
Sinon
404100201_2_a
bg_event_urtharbrunnr
And here we are!
Leafa
404100201_1_a
I've got to figure out who it is!
I'm going to look into this...
Kirito
404100101_40_a
I see...
Asuna
404100101_39_a
No... It looks like they don't
know it yet. All they have to go
on so far are a few pictures.
Kirito
404100101_38_a
Does the article mention
that player's avatar name?
Asuna
404100101_37_a
But someone actually made it all
the way! Whoever they are, they've
got to be pretty incredible.
Kirito
404100101_36_a
You're one to talk, Daddy...
Yui
404100101_35_a
Imagine taking on a fight
like that all by yourself
Kirito
404100101_34_a
Huh?
Asuna
404100101_33_a
And I did make it out in one
piece... But it says somebody
beat the whole quest alone!
Kirito
404100101_32_a
Ha ha! I was just interested in
seeing how tough it really was.
Kirito
404100101_31_a
Agh, Kirito! Why are you always
putting yourself in danger
like that?
Asuna
404100101_30_a
Oh, yeah...
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Yui
404100101_29_a
H-Hey, Yui! Didn't we agree not
to tell Mommy about that...?
Kirito
404100101_28_a
Y-You did what?!
Asuna
404100101_27_a
Yeah! Daddy tried that quest
on his own and nearly died!
Yui
404100101_26_a
Ha ha! Now I see
what you mean.
Asuna
404100101_25_a
Yeah, since it's mainly
the players getting
hacked and slashed...
Kirito
404100101_24_a
Hack-and-slash for masochists?
Asuna
404100101_23_a
There's even a new crazy
hack-and-slash quest
there for masochists.
Kirito
404100101_22_a
Yeah. It's so intense that you're
sure to be wiped out soon unless
you go with an advanced party.
Asuna
404100101_21_a
Remember how the enemies there
are so much stronger than the
ones here on the surface?
Kirito
404100101_20_a
Big news?
Asuna
404100101_19_a
It's an article about Jotunheimr,
but...this looks like some
seriously big news!
Kirito
404100101_18_a
Kirito? What is it?
Asuna
404100101_17_a
S-Sorry...
Wait... What?!
Kirito
404100101_16_a
Yui
404100101_15_a
Kirito, manners! Put the newspaper
away at the breakfast table.
It's rude!
Asuna
404100101_14_a
Uh-huh, cool, cool...
Thanks, Asuna.
Kirito
404100101_13_a
Come on, you two!
Breakfast is ready.
Asuna
404100101_12_a
Now then, what's today's
front-page story...?
Kirito
404100101_11_a
Thanks, Yui.
Kirito
404100101_10_a
Download complete.
Here you go, Daddy.
Yui
404100101_9_a
...
Yui
404100101_8_a
Sure!
Yui
404100101_7_a
Oh, Yui, could you display
today's MMO Tomorrow
for me?
Asuna
404100101_6_a
Good morning, Yui!
Asuna
404100101_5_a
Mornin', Yui.
Kirito
404100101_4_a
Asuna
404100101_3_a
Kirito
404100101_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Mommy, Daddy! Good morning.
Yui
404100101_1_a
It's a special secret between
Kazuto and me!
Leafa
404001201_47_a
Hehehe...
Nooo, I couldn't bear to tell you!
Leafa
404001201_46_a
Yeah, Liz is right!
Leafa! Kirito!
Out with it! What happened?!
Silica
404001201_45_a
Leafa
404001201_44_a
Silica
404001201_43_a
Yeah, you are digging yourself
a hole a mile deep.
Miiiiiighty suspicious indeed.
Liz
404001201_42_a
N-Nothing! Really!
Besides, I can't just tell you!
That would violate her privacy!
Kirito
404001201_41_a
Oh yeah?
Than what DID you do to her, hmm?
Sinon
404001201_40_a
I didn't do anything weird to her
at all!
Kirito
404001201_39_a
Sinon
404001201_38_a
Asuna
404001201_37_a
H-Hey, girls! Come on! You're
jumping to crazy conclusions!
Kirito
404001201_36_a
Grr...
I'm getting some seriously
suspicious vibes here...
Liz
404001201_35_a
What in the world is that
supposed to mean?!
Silica
404001201_34_a
Liz
404001201_33_a
Silica
404001201_32_a
Hehe, he didn't pull any stunts!
Though I suppose you could
say he did, in a way...
Leafa
404001201_31_a
Sinon
404001201_30_a
Asuna
404001201_29_a
What are you
I didn't do anything!
Kirito
404001201_28_a
Leafa
404001201_27_a
Silica
404001201_26_a
Agreed. Which means...
Hey, Kiiirito? What sort of
stunt did you pull THIS time?
Liz
404001201_25_a
Let's chalk that up as a victory.
However...Asuna's right.
Something doesn't add up.
Sinon
404001201_24_a
Kirito
404001201_23_a
Sinon
404001201_22_a
Really?
That doesn't make much sense...
Asuna
404001201_21_a
Actually, I feel much better than
before! Like my dislike of water's
faded a bit!
Leafa
404001201_20_a
Liz
404001201_19_a
Silica
404001201_18_a
Yeah, totally 100% fine!
Leafa
404001201_17_a
Kirito
404001201_16_a
Sinon
404001201_15_a
You DROWNED?!
Are you okay, Leafa?!
Asuna
404001201_14_a
Err, you saw that? I uh,
managed to drown. Only a little.
The system logged me out...
Leafa
404001201_13_a
You guys logged out for a minute
during that last quest, right?
Silica
404001201_12_a
By the way...
Leafa, Kirito?
Silica
404001201_9_a
Leafa
404001201_11_a
Liz
404001201_10_a
Kirito
404001201_8_a
Sinon
404001201_7_a
Hehe, you said it.
Asuna
404001201_6_a
so we can finally have a
relaxing vacation.
Liz
404001201_5_a
Yeah, totally.
The crowd's thinned out,
Liz
404001201_4_a
Leafa
404001201_3_a
Liz
404001201_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Wow!
The wind feels so nice!
Silica
404001201_1_a
Sure thing!
Kirito
404001101_22_a
Right, now let's go.
Leafa
404001101_21_a
Got it. Done and done.
Kirito
404001101_20_a
I'll be fine, so don't treat me
like I'm made of glass!
Leafa
404001101_19_a
So in other words, stop worrying,
you wimp!
Leafa
404001101_18_a
Oh...cool.
Glad to hear it, I guess?
Kirito
404001101_17_a
I'm so happy I feel like I could
do anything!
Leafa
404001101_16_a
Besides...now that I know my
big brother's here to look out
for me,
Leafa
404001101_15_a
Ahaha, no way!
I'm not that delicate!
Leafa
404001101_14_a
Honestly, I half-expected you to
start freaking out just looking
at that river again.
Kirito
404001101_13_a
I was sure getting dragged under
the water and drowned earlier
would've had you off your game.
Kirito
404001101_12_a
I guess I am... Hehehe!
Maybe it's because I'm in a
super good mood?
Leafa
404001101_11_a
Huh?
I am?
Leafa
404001101_10_a
You're moving way better now than
you were before you logged out...
Kirito
404001101_9_a
What's up?
Leafa
404001101_8_a
Yeah...
Hey, Sugu?
Kirito
404001101_7_a
Hehe, okay!
Let's go find everyone!
Leafa
404001101_6_a
Yup, looks like it.
No monsters in sight.
Kirito
404001101_5_a
There!
Now we REALLY got all of them!
Leafa
404001101_4_a
Graaagh!
Monster
404001101_3_a
Kirito
404001101_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
Hiiiyah!!
Leafa
404001101_1_a
Yeah...
Game on.
Kazuto
404001001_21_a
We've gotta go beat the snot
outta those monsters!
Suguha
404001001_20_a
Now come on!
Let's dive back in!
Suguha
404001001_19_a
Sugu...
Kazuto
404001001_18_a
Isn't it obvious?
If you're that concerned about me,
it means you really do care!
Suguha
404001001_17_a
What do you mean?
Kazuto
404001001_16_a
But...I'm happy to hear that
you're worrying about me.
Suguha
404001001_15_a
Ahaha, no way!
You're overthinking it, Kazuto!
Suguha
404001001_14_a
I know, but...maybe your fear of
water is because of that trauma?
It's possible.
Kazuto
404001001_13_a
I don't really remember it that
clearly, anyway. It's probably
completely unrelated!
Suguha
404001001_12_a
H-Hey! None of that now!
I was the one who fell into that
pond! I dug my own...well.
Suguha
404001001_11_a
You almost drowning back then
and being bad at swimming now...
It's all my fault...
Kazuto
404001001_10_a
I was just thinking... I'm the
older sibling. It's my
responsibility to keep you safe...
Kazuto
404001001_9_a
Don't go all serious on me...
Suguha
404001001_8_a
Hey! You're supposed to hit me
with a zinger here, like
"You're still a handful, Sugu!"
Suguha
404001001_7_a
...
Kazuto
404001001_6_a
I was a real handful back then,
wasn't I?
Suguha
404001001_5_a
Huh... Oh, yeah...
You were the one who
saved me, right?
Suguha
404001001_4_a
But I think that's because you
almost drowned in the pond behind
our house when you were a kid...
Kazuto
404001001_3_a
Suguha
404001001_2_a
bg_17_suguha_room_sunset
I know I've said this before...
Kazuto
404001001_1_a
Well...
Kazuto
404000901_18_a
So it's really strange that no
matter how hard I try,
water and I just don't mix...
Suguha
404000901_17_a
I mean, I'm in pretty good shape,
and I'm generally awesome at every
other sport...
Suguha
404000901_16_a
What do you mean?
Kazuto
404000901_15_a
But why am I such a bad swimmer
anyway?
Suguha
404000901_14_a
Seriously, don't sweat it.
Kazuto
404000901_13_a
I guess...
But I feel like a total idiot...
Suguha
404000901_12_a
Anybody in your situation would
panic if they got dragged under.
Even if it was really shallow.
Kazuto
404000901_11_a
Hey, happens to everyone.
You aren't a good swimmer
to begin with.
Kazuto
404000901_10_a
I panicked, didn't I...?
Suguha
404000901_9_a
O-Oh...
Ahaha... Awkward...
Suguha
404000901_8_a
Your AmuSphere thought you were
in danger, so it disconnected you.
Kazuto
404000901_7_a
That monster dragged you under
the water, and you must have
blacked out.
Kazuto
404000901_6_a
What...?
Why am I...?
Suguha
404000901_5_a
Huh...?
Oh...Kazuto?
Suguha
404000901_4_a
...
Suguha
404000901_3_a
Suguha
404000901_2_a
bg_17_suguha_room_sunset
Sugu!
Suguha!
Kazuto
404000901_1_a
I should log out too!
Kirito
404000801_23_a
Her AmuSphere must have detected
danger and automatically
disconnected her...
Kirito
404000801_22_a
Sugu's avatar...
It disappeared!
Kirito
404000801_21_a
No way!
Kirito
404000801_20_a
...
Leafa
404000801_19_a
Phew...
S-Sugu, are you okay?!
Kirito
404000801_18_a
Gaaak!!
Monster
404000801_17_a
Take this, monster!!
Kirito
404000801_16_a
Sugu! Damn! Is she too
panicked to just stand up?!
Kirito
404000801_15_a
Kazu...to!
gulp
H-Help! I...
Leafa
404000801_14_a
It's definitely not deep enough
to drown in...
Kirito
404000801_13_a
Wait a sec...
Isn't the water here,
like, super shallow?
Kirito
404000801_12_a
Sugu!
I'm coming!
Kirito
404000801_11_a
Ahh! Help!
I'm drowning!
Leafa
404000801_10_a
Damn!
It's dragging Sugu into the river!
Kirito
404000801_9_a
Ahhhhh!!
Leafa
404000801_8_a
Leafa
404000801_7_a
Kirito
404000801_6_a
GRAWR!
Monster
404000801_5_a
Huh?
Leafa
404000801_4_a
Yeah, I thi
SUGU!
Behind you!!
Kirito
404000801_3_a
Kirito
404000801_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
Is that all of them?
Leafa
404000801_1_a
Yeah!
Kirito
404000701_25_a
Ah well, I forgive you.
So, let's get monster-killing!
Leafa
404000701_24_a
sigh
You really look on the
bright side of things, huh, Kazuto?
Leafa
404000701_23_a
Ha ha ha! But we owe it thanks!
These sudden event quests are
what make VRMMOs fun!
Kirito
404000701_22_a
Seriously. The Cardinal System
didn't have to strive for such...
realism this time.
Leafa
404000701_21_a
I know it is, but...ick.
Leafa
404000701_20_a
But that's what it is, right?
I just call it as I see it.
Kirito
404000701_19_a
Can you stop calling it that?!
It sounds gross!
Leafa
404000701_18_a
There it is!
A garbage monster!
Kirito
404000701_17_a
Leafa
404000701_16_a
Kirito
404000701_15_a
GRAAAUGH!!
Monster
404000701_14_a
Hey! Look, over there!
Leafa
404000701_13_a
You are so weird.
Kirito
404000701_12_a
Nooothing!
Leafa
404000701_11_a
What? Sheesh!
Kirito
404000701_10_a
Ehehe. Kazuto! Kazu-kazu-to!
Leafa
404000701_9_a
Y-Yeah, I guess you're right...
Kirito
404000701_8_a
Hey, chill out! We're in the
middle of nowhere. There's
no one else around.
Leafa
404000701_7_a
Gack...!
Kirito
404000701_6_a
Pot's calling the kettle black.
You just said "Sugu."
Leafa
404000701_5_a
Be careful, okay? You know
talking about the real world's
not cool in-game.
Kirito
404000701_4_a
Yeah! Wait a sec. "Kazuto"? Sugu,
you always just throw that out
there whenever you get worked up.
Kirito
404000701_3_a
Kirito
404000701_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
Alllright! Kazuto, monsters should
spawn around here, so let's kick
their butts!
Leafa

Sinon
404000601_30_a
Asuna
404000601_29_a
Roger that.
Kirito
404000601_28_a
We should split up to cover more
ground.
Leafa
404000601_27_a

404000601_26_a
Silica
404000601_25_a
Yup. It looks like it's a pretty
wide area, though.
Leafa
404000601_24_a
Sinon
404000601_23_a
Asuna
404000601_22_a
Alright then! Leafa, can you tell
us where these garbage monsters
are spawning?
Kirito
404000601_21_a
Liz
404000601_20_a
Leafa
404000601_19_a
Yeah! I want to help keep this
place nice and pretty!
Silica
404000601_18_a
Maybe...
It's worth a shot, anyway.
We're here to help!
Asuna
404000601_17_a
Hold up. Doesn't that give us a
simple solution? Kill the
monsters, fix the problem.
Sinon
404000601_16_a
Sinon
404000601_15_a
Asuna
404000601_14_a
Yikes. Well, that also explains
why people are starting to squeeze
in tighter here.
Kirito
404000601_13_a
Silica
404000601_12_a
Liz
404000601_11_a
Exactly. Worse, our river retreat
area is slowly being destroyed by
these garbage monsters.
Leafa
404000601_10_a
but the "pollution" caused by
stress on the system caused a
quest to spawn to compensate.
Kirito
404000601_9_a
Sinon
404000601_8_a
Asuna
404000601_7_a
So, in other words, the virtual
mountain here isn't getting
"physically" polluted,
Kirito
404000601_6_a
Yeah. I don't want to meet any of
these garbage monsters. Ick.
Liz
404000601_5_a
That sounds...gross...

Silica
404000601_3_a

Apparently, monsters are starting
to spawn from the "garbage"
caused by all these players.
Leafa
404000601_1_a
Sinon
404000501_36_a
Asuna
404000501_35_a
How did it
Oh, right, Cardinal.
Kirito
404000501_34_a
It seems like the system
compensated by automatically
generating a new quest.
Leafa
404000501_33_a
On a normal day, this place rarely
sees any visitors. Now we suddenly
have a ton of players here.
Leafa
404000501_32_a
Silica
404000501_31_a

404000501_30_a
They are, but that's not the
problem.
Leafa

Sinon
404000501_28_a
Asuna
404000501_27_a
Aren't trees and the ground
immortal objects?
Kirito
404000501_26_a
Huh...?
What are you talking about?
Silica
404000501_25_a
With this many people up here,
we've got a natural disaster
barreling our way.
Leafa
404000501_24_a
Silica
404000501_23_a
Liz
404000501_22_a
Yup.
Not a human problem.
Leafa
404000501_21_a
Sinon
404000501_20_a
Kirito
404000501_19_a
Another problem?
You mean besides lots of fights?
Asuna
404000501_18_a
Still...all these people have
caused another problem to
rear its ugly head...
Leafa
404000501_17_a
If they weren't a Sylph and a
Salamander, I would've come up
with another solution.
Leafa
404000501_16_a
Silica
404000501_15_a
Liz
404000501_14_a
Oh, butt out. It was the
quickest way to settle
them down, that's all.
Leafa
404000501_13_a
Sinon
404000501_12_a
Asuna
404000501_11_a
That was some peacekeeping.
You just shoved the power of
authority in their faces.
Kirito
404000501_10_a
Good. You better.
Leafa
404000501_9_a
S-Sorry...
I'll be good, I promise...
Player B
404000501_8_a
Still wanna cause trouble?
Eugene's puh-retty terrifying
when he's angry.
Leafa
404000501_7_a
Erk... You do?
Aha. Ha...
Player B
404000501_6_a
Oh really now? In case you didn't
know, me and General Eugene
go way back.
Leafa
404000501_5_a
Hmph. I don't care about your
Sylph rules. I'm a Salamander!
I can do what I want!
Player B
404000501_4_a
Y-Yes, ma'am...
Player A
404000501_3_a
Cause trouble again, and I swear
I'll have Sakuya rain fire and
vengeance upon you!
Leafa
404000501_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
So that's the deal, got it?
Think before you act, and be
considerate of others!
Leafa
404000501_1_a
Sinon
404000401_50_a
Asuna
404000401_49_a
Ha ha, got it.
You go show them who's boss.
Kirito
404000401_48_a
If push comes to shove,
I'll just shove my sword down
those troublemaker's throats.
Leafa

Silica

404000401_45_a
Nah, I'm fine! Besides,
this area isn't a safe zone.
Leafa
404000401_44_a
Sinon
404000401_43_a
Asuna
404000401_42_a
I got your back, Leafa.
Kirito
404000401_41_a
I'll act in Sakuya's stead and try
to keep this riverside retreat a
fun and friendly place.
Leafa
404000401_40_a
Neutral zone or not, this is still
Sylph territory. As a Sylph,
it's my duty to keep the peace.
Leafa
404000401_39_a
Are you sure you want to do that?
They look scary...

Hold up, guys.

Leafa
404000401_30_a
And we are presented with a
perfect example of the merciless
world of spot claiming.

404000401_29_a
Piss off! You were gone!
That means it's up for grabs!
???
404000401_28_a
You can't just show up and
steal it from us!

404000401_27_a
That was our spot!
We claimed it!

404000401_26_a
You got a problem?!

Hey!
What the hell?!

404000401_21_a
It's anything goes when it comes
to fighting for a spot for camping
or fireworks and so on.
Kirito
404000401_20_a
It's much easier for me to let
loose when I know there are still
rules and boundaries.
Asuna
404000401_19_a
Ahaha...
Yeah, maybe.
Asuna
404000401_18_a
Asuna might have better luck
challenging people to duels for
their spots.
Sinon
404000401_17_a
Kirito
404000401_16_a
Sinon
404000401_15_a
Umm... But...

Come on, Asuna! Get with the
program. Get aggressive! Grawr!

Wow... You're all so...ruthless...
Asuna
404000401_10_a
Exactly!
You gotta be vicious!
Kirito
404000401_9_a
Asuna
404000401_8_a
Kirito
404000401_7_a
Natural selection. The strong
and fast get a spot, the weak
and slow go home crying.
Sinon
404000401_6_a
You can really get a glimpse of
humanity's dark side when it comes
to the struggle for a good spot.

That shaded spot under the
tree is open!

Leafa
404000301_25_a
But...it looks like all the
camping and fishing spots
are totally taken...

First things first!
Let's claim a spot!
Kirito

H-Hey, cheer up, everyone!
We came all the way here!
Let's have some fun!
Kirito
404000301_20_a
Yeah. It's way too crowded to have
fun. She should've set a max
player limit...
Leafa
404000301_19_a
But with this many people here...
Liz
404000301_18_a
It's pretty nice of her to declare
this area a neutral zone...
Liz
404000301_17_a
Normally, only players trying to
invade would set foot on another
race's territory uninvited.
Liz
404000301_16_a
Silica
404000301_15_a
Liz
404000301_14_a
Yeah. Sakuya declared this area a
temporary special neutral zone so
anyone could visit.
Leafa
404000301_13_a
But looking around, it seems like
there's players from every race
wandering around.
Asuna
404000301_12_a
There was no way any of us could
have predicted a Sylph territory
area would be this crowded...
Sinon
404000301_11_a
Kirito
404000301_9_a
No, that's not why I sighed.
Besides, it's not your fault.
Sinon
404000301_8_a
Asuna
404000301_10_a
I wanted to take a nice trip with

But this is VR!
We don't have to worry
about that here!
Leafa
404000201_24_a
Ahaha... Yeah, I went on a lot of
those vacations with my family
when I was smaller.
Asuna
404000201_23_a
Sounds like you're speaking from
experience, Asuna.
Kirito
404000201_22_a
It's horrible trying to escape the
heat, only to get trapped by a
seething mass of people...
Asuna
404000201_21_a
And it feels like the whole world
is trying to get out there,
so it's crazy crowded.
Asuna
404000201_20_a
It's pretty costly to take a trip
that far away.
Sinon
404000201_19_a
Kirito
404000201_18_a
Asuna
404000201_17_a
Yeah. Most of the summer
spots are really far away too,
like Hokkaido or Nagano.
Sinon
404000201_16_a
But we're all still just kids,
so it's pretty hard to arrange.
Silica

I was really hoping we'd all be
able to go on a summer trip
together in the real world...

That sounds awesome!
Let's treat ourselves to a
virtual super vacation!
Suguha
404000101_17_a
so let's invite everyone to a cool
mountain retreat in ALO.
What do you say?
Kazuto
404000101_16_a
Yup, that's the one. Hey, here's
an idea! It's hard to get everyone
together for a trip out here,
Kazuto
404000101_15_a
Hmm... Oh yeah, I know what you're
talking about. That river spot in
the Sylph mountains.
Suguha
404000101_14_a
I heard that they didn't just add
ultra-hot summer areas, but maps
to help you beat the heat too.
Kazuto
404000101_13_a
Yeah. ALO's filled with summer
event areas right now.
Suguha
404000101_12_a
And when it's summer out here in
the real world, the virtual world
generally follows suit.
Kazuto
404000101_11_a
Sure, have a blast. This heat
really is, uh, hot, though, huh?
Kazuto
404000101_10_a
That's it! I'm eating ice cream,
and no one can stop me!
Suguha
404000101_9_a
Ugh! I can't take it anymore!
Suguha
404000101_8_a
Then just deal with it, geez...
Kazuto
404000101_7_a
But if I turn it on, it'll be
doubly hot when I go out to train
and I won't wanna do ANYTHING!
Suguha
404000101_6_a
And if you're that hot, just
turn the air conditioner on.
Kazuto
404000101_5_a
Why are you asking me?
Kazuto
404000101_4_a
Kazuto! Why is it so hot?!
Suguha
404000101_3_a
Kazuto
404000101_2_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
It is SO hot!
SO HOT!!
Suguha
404000101_1_a
I'm sure it will too.
Kirito
403801201_17_a
I'm sure that day will come!
Asuna
403801201_16_a
Hopefully one day, the world will
realize that VRMMOs can be a
positive force for society.
Kirito
403801201_15_a
After SAO, VRMMOs have had a
really bad reputation.
Kirito
403801201_14_a
I feel the same way.
Kirito
403801201_13_a
can be used to save people!
I almost feel like I'm helping
change people's lives!
Asuna
403801201_12_a
It's weird. I'm really glad that
Sphica's gotten better, but I'm
even more happy to know that VR
Asuna
403801201_11_a
And it looks like this proves that
VR can be used to help heal
people's emotional wounds.
Kirito
403801201_10_a
That's still fantastic news.
Really, really fantastic.
Asuna
403801201_9_a
But it'll still be a bit longer
until she can go back to school.
Kirito
403801201_8_a
Yeah. Apparently, she's been
doing a lot better ever since
we beat that bullying quest.
Kirito
403801201_7_a
She is?!
That's wonderful!
Asuna
403801201_6_a
Apparently, Sphica's going to be
discharged from the hospital.
Kirito
403801201_5_a
I just talked to Chrysheight.

Hehe, it looks like Sphica's back
to her old self.
Asuna
403801101_26_a
I'm gonna get so good at hiding,
even I won't be able to find me!
Sphica
403801101_25_a
You're right! I'm the bestest most
famousest hider around! I can't
let this stand!
Sphica
403801101_24_a
Still, you've got a lot of hiding
practice to do, Sphica! We've
gotten too good at finding you!
Kirito
403801101_23_a
Oh...yeah, I guess that was pretty
callous. Ahaha...
Kirito
403801101_22_a
K-Kirito! Not cool!
Asuna
403801101_21_a
That's why you're upset?
I was expecting you to be
grateful that we found you...
Kirito
403801101_20_a
I sure am! You and Kirito found
me WAY too quick when I was
hiding!
Sphica
403801101_19_a
What?! You are?!
Asuna
403801101_18_a
But...I'm pretty upset about one
thing still!
Sphica
403801101_17_a
Hehe! I'm really happy right now!
Sphica
403801101_16_a
You sure did, Sphica.
Kirito
403801101_15_a
And I did it! Yay!!
Sphica
403801101_14_a
I... I wanted to stop that kid
from being bullied!
Sphica

Sphica, you really were incredible
in that battle back there!
Asuna
403801101_12_a
All's well that ends well,
right, Sphica?
Kirito
403801101_11_a
D-Don't mention it!
Sphica
403801101_10_a
Everyone believed me because of
you. Thank you!
Child A
403801101_9_a
Aw, don't worry about it...
Child A
403801101_8_a
G-Got it... Hey...I'm sorry that
we were mean to you...
Child B
403801101_7_a
So you better promise me you'll
never ever bully ANYONE again!
Got it?!
Sphica
403801101_6_a
It did, but we beat it up!
The village is safe now!
Sphica
403801101_5_a
Whoa... Check this out!
A horn this big could only
come from a monster!

Kirito
403801001_31_a
Sphica
403801001_30_a
Look, it's Rain and Strea!
Asuna
403801001_29_a
We started the quest!
Strea
403801001_28_a
Strea
403801001_27_a
Kirito! Asuna!
Rain
403801001_26_a
Asuna
403801001_25_a
You've gotten a lot stronger,
Sphica.
Kirito
403801001_24_a
O-Okay... I will.
Sphica
403801001_23_a
So...believe in us.
Okay, Sphica?
Asuna
403801001_22_a
Besides, we'll be here for you
whenever you need us. If you're
in trouble, we'll help you.
Asuna
403801001_21_a
I...
Sphica
403801001_20_a
And that's why you don't want to
see anyone else have to go through
what you did...right?
Kirito
403801001_19_a
Maybe you didn't have someone to
stand up for you when you were
bullied...
Kirito
403801001_18_a
Then help us stop it.
Let's save that kid, okay, Sphica?
Kirito
403801001_17_a
I don't want to see anyone get
bullied ever again...
Sphica
403801001_16_a
But...what if we find the monster
and they still don't believe him?
Sphica
403801001_15_a
Exactly!
Kirito
403801001_14_a
If we do that...he won't be
bullied anymore?
Sphica
403801001_13_a
So we're going to find that
monster he was talking about!
Asuna
403801001_12_a
That's right. We'll prove that he
was telling the truth.
Asuna
403801001_11_a
We can help him?
Sphica
403801001_10_a
They were, and that's why we
have to help him.
Asuna
403801001_9_a
B-But...they called that kid a
liar. They were bullying him!
Sphica
403801001_8_a
Don't worry, Sphica. It's okay.
No one around here's going
to bully you.
Asuna
403801001_7_a
I want them to stop being big
dumb bullies...
Sphica
403801001_6_a
So this was where you were
hiding...
Asuna
403801001_5_a
Sphica...
Kirito
403801001_4_a
Asuna
403801001_3_a
Kirito
403801001_2_a

sniff
... 
sob
...
Sphica
403801001_1_a
Right!
Asuna
403800901_62_a
I see a bunch of rocks over there!
Let's go check it out!
Kirito
403800901_61_a
Do you think...?
Asuna
403800901_60_a
That's right... Oh! Sphica said
it was a good hiding spot,
didn't she?!
Asuna
403800901_59_a
You were hiding under that
hollowed-out rock, right?
Kirito
403800901_58_a
Asuna, remember the last time we
played hide-and-seek with her?
Kirito
403800901_57_a
Wait...!
Kirito
403800901_56_a
I checked every thicket, nook,
and cranny I could find, but
not a single sign of her.
Asuna
403800901_55_a
I scanned the whole area from
the sky, but I didn't see anyone
that looked like Sphica.
Kirito
403800901_54_a
Rats...
Me neither...
Kirito
403800901_53_a
I couldn't find any trace
of her...
Asuna
403800901_52_a
Asuna
403800901_51_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Asuna, any luck on your end?!
Kirito
403800901_50_a
Good idea.
Asuna
403800901_49_a
Alright, let's split up.
We'll find her faster that way.
Kirito
403800901_48_a
Yeah...
I think she's close by, but...
Asuna
403800901_47_a
She's a fighter. I just wish we
could find her. Her hiding skills
are a lot of trouble right now.
Kirito
403800901_46_a
I think...she's struggling with
her pain as hard as she can...
Asuna
403800901_45_a
Yeah, which means that Sphica's
not that bad off right now...
Kirito
403800901_44_a
But doesn't the AmuSphere log you
out automatically if it detects
physical or psychological danger?
Asuna
403800901_43_a
So she hasn't logged out yet,
at least.
Kirito
403800901_42_a
I checked my friend list,
and it seems like she's still
in this area.
Kirito
403800901_41_a
Kirito
403800901_40_a
Where could Sphica have gone...?
Asuna
403800901_39_a
Asuna
403800901_38_a
Yeah! We're counting on you!
Kirito
403800901_37_a
Strea
403800901_36_a
R-Right!
We'll start the quest!
Rain
403800901_35_a
Asuna
403800901_34_a
Rain! Strea!
You two stay here!
Kirito
403800901_33_a
We've got to go after her!
Asuna
403800901_32_a
Ah!
Sphica!
Kirito
403800901_31_a
STOP BULLYING HIM!!!
Sphica
403800901_30_a
Oh no... Is she having a traumatic
flashback because of this quest?!
Asuna
403800901_29_a
Asuna
403800901_28_a
Kirito
403800901_27_a
S-Stop...bullying...him...
Sphica
403800901_26_a
Rain
403800901_25_a
Sphica?
What's wrong?
Strea
403800901_24_a
Asuna
403800901_23_a
Kirito
403800901_22_a
whimper
...
Sphica
403800901_21_a
Strea
403800901_20_a
Huh?
What's the problem, Kirito?
Rain
403800901_19_a
Sphica
403800901_18_a
Asuna
403800901_17_a
Oh...oh no...
This is bad...
Kirito
403800901_16_a
N-No, I'm not! It's the truth!
Child A
403800901_15_a
Liar!
You're a big fat liar!
Child B
403800901_14_a
the other kids will believe him
and we'll beat the quest.
That's about it.
Rain
403800901_13_a
If we can go find the monster he
saw and take it out,
Rain
403800901_12_a
The other kids are teasing him
because they think he's lying.
Rain
403800901_11_a
According to the quest description,
a village kid said he saw a
monster in the mountains.
Rain
403800901_9_a
Strea
403800901_10_a
Asuna
403800901_8_a
Hey, what are all those NPC kids
yelling about?
Kirito
403800901_7_a
It's not a lie!
???
403800901_6_a
Stop lying! We're all so very
sick of your lies!
???
403800901_5_a
Sphica
403800901_4_a
Asuna
403800901_3_a
Kirito
403800901_2_a
bg_18_mountain
S-Stop it!
???
403800901_1_a
Hehe... I'll let it slide this
time. Alright, let's go!
Asuna
403800801_27_a
Come on, let's go!
Kirito
403800801_26_a
Rain
403800801_25_a
Asuna
403800801_24_a
So we have...
Well, it's game time!
Kirito
403800801_23_a
We've made it to the next town!
Strea
403800801_22_a
Strea
403800801_21_a
Kirito!
Asuna!
Rain!
Sphica
403800801_20_a
Asuna
403800801_19_a
Asuna...
Kirito
403800801_18_a
Hehe... I wasn't mad. I just
thought it'd be nice if you asked
me for advice next time.
Asuna
403800801_17_a
But Kikuoka
Chrysheight: I need
to stop calling him that
just
started blabbing.
Kirito
403800801_16_a
H-Hey, don't look at me like that!
I was going to, but I pulled back
at the last moment!
Kirito
403800801_15_a
In the end, you disregarded
game etiquette and pried into
her private life, didn't you?
Asuna
403800801_14_a
Of course we'll keep playing
with her. But Kirito...
Asuna
403800801_13_a
Yeah!
Rain
403800801_12_a
I know what you mean. So
let's keep playing with her!
She needs friends.
Kirito
403800801_11_a
I can't imagine that cheerful
girl over there all down and
blue...
Asuna
403800801_10_a
Sphica...
And she's so energetic
and outgoing in VR...
Rain
403800801_9_a
Kirito
403800801_8_a
Rain
403800801_7_a
So that's her story...
Asuna
403800801_6_a
What's an "NPC"?
Sphica
403800801_5_a
Wow! You're a curious one,
aren't you! I'm an NPC, silly.
I was just set this way!
Strea
403800801_4_a
How did you do it?
Sphica
403800801_3_a
Strea
403800801_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Strea! You're so much more
grown up than my mommy!
Sphica
403800801_1_a
Of course we will!
Kazuto
403800701_27_a
Sure. Her parents already gave me
the okay. They also said they hope
you'll keep playing with Sphica.
Kikuoka
403800701_26_a
Can I tell Asuna and the others
about this? I'll be careful not to
let the info slip to anyone else.
Kazuto
403800701_25_a
Hey, don't mention it. Friends
scratch each other's backs, right?
Kikuoka
403800701_24_a
Y-Yeah. It is!
Thank you!
Kazuto
403800701_23_a
So, that's what you wanted to
know, right?
Kikuoka
403800701_22_a
...
Kazuto
403800701_21_a
You played a lot of hide-and-seek
with her. She probably thinks of
you as her first real friends.
Kikuoka
403800701_20_a
But...why?
Kazuto
403800701_19_a
Really. Her parents were quite
shocked. They think you guys might
have had something to do with it.
Kikuoka
403800701_18_a
Really?
Kazuto
403800701_17_a
For the better. She's slowly
re-learning how to communicate
in the real world.
Kikuoka
403800701_16_a
A change?!
Kazuto
403800701_15_a
But recently, the doctors have
noticed a change in her condition.
Kikuoka
403800701_14_a
That's her original personality.
She likely feels she can be her
true self in the virtual world.
Kikuoka
403800701_13_a
But hold on: Sphica is really
outgoing in ALO. She doesn't have
any problems communicating.
Kazuto
403800701_12_a
Exactly. The Medicuboid is still
quite experimental, so we need
as much clinical data as possible.
Kikuoka
403800701_11_a
So you set her up with the
Medicuboid to see if it could
help treat her.
Kazuto
403800701_10_a
virtual world can help patients
with mental illnesses overcome
psychological trauma.
Kikuoka
403800701_9_a
spend their final days in some
modicum of comfort. However,
it's been theorized that life in a
Kikuoka
403800701_8_a
The Medicuboid was originally
developed to help patients with
serious physical illnesses
Kikuoka
403800701_7_a
Eventually, she stopped going
to school and now barely ever
speaks to anyone.
Kikuoka
403800701_6_a
That's right. She was bullied.
A lot. So much so, she started
having problems communicating.
Kikuoka
403800701_5_a
A mental illness...?
Kazuto
403800701_4_a
But it's not a disease of the
body. It's one of the mind.
Sad in one so young.
Kikuoka
403800701_3_a
Yep. She's been diagnosed with
a serious illness.
Kikuoka
403800701_2_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_night
Is Sphica
Kazuto
403800701_1_a
Really?!
Kazuto
403800601_24_a
So they gave me permission to tell
you everything, in case you ever
asked.
Kikuoka
403800601_23_a
Yup. Her parents heard you were
friends with her in ALO, you see.
Kikuoka
403800601_22_a
You did?
Kazuto
403800601_21_a
It's just strange to hear you be
so unassertive. Either way,
I planned on telling you.
Kikuoka
403800601_20_a
H-Hey! Did I say something funny?!
Kazuto
403800601_19_a
Heh...
Kikuoka
403800601_18_a
But...if there's anything I can do
to help
like back in the Death
Gun incident
let me know.
Kazuto
403800601_17_a
...
Kikuoka
403800601_16_a
So never mind...
Forget I called...
Kazuto
403800601_15_a
Yeah...but I don't have any right
to ask. It's her private life.
Kazuto
403800601_14_a
So...you want to know her story,
right?
Kikuoka
403800601_13_a
I...see...
Kazuto
403800601_12_a
She's a Medicuboid user out here
in the good ol' real world, so of
course we're keeping tabs on her.
Kikuoka
403800601_11_a
My sources tell me that you and
your friends have been spending
time with her lately.
Kikuoka
403800601_10_a
H-How did you know?
Kazuto
403800601_9_a
It's about a certain little Imp
in Alfheim Online, right?
Name of Sphica?
Kikuoka
403800601_8_a
Wait, you did?!
Kazuto
403800601_7_a
Yeah, sure. Anything for a pal.
Besides, I had a feeling you'd
be calling me.
Kikuoka
403800601_6_a
I...hate to bother you,
but can I ask you something?
Kazuto
403800601_5_a
It's unlike you.
Something wrong?
Kikuoka
403800601_4_a
Heh. How's it going?
Relax, Kirito, you sound nervous.
Kikuoka
403800601_3_a
H-Hello...? It's m-me.
K-Kazuto Kirigaya.
Kazuto
403800601_2_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_night
...
Kazuto
403800601_1_a
Yay! Thank you!!
Sphica
403800501_26_a
Yeah, and if they can't make it,
we'll just reschedule. It's all of
us or none!
Kirito
403800501_25_a
Hehe, good to hear.
Alright, I'm gonna call
everyone, okay?
Asuna
403800501_24_a
I was kinda sad I couldn't do it
with you guys, but I'm really
happy now that I can!
Sphica
403800501_23_a
R-Really?!
Thank you so much!
Sphica
403800501_22_a
We agreed we'd play it together
once you logged back in.
Kirito
403800501_21_a
No. We asked everyone to hold
off, and it's not like the quest is
going anywhere.
Kirito
403800501_20_a
Huh? You guys didn't go finish
it already?
Sphica
403800501_19_a
Phew... So, what do you say we
play that quest we couldn't do
yesterday?
Asuna
403800501_18_a
Nope! The doctor just got the
checkup time wrong!
Sphica
403800501_17_a
So you not making it to the quest
the other day wasn't because of
anything serious?
Kirito
403800501_16_a
O-Oh... Sorry to hear that.
Well, I'm just glad to see you.
Kirito
403800501_15_a
Sphica...
Asuna
403800501_14_a
My parents did tell me I have to
stay with the doctors for a bit,
though...
Sphica
403800501_13_a
You...are?
Kirito
403800501_12_a
Of course I'm okay! I'm always
filled with sparkly bubbles
of energy!
Sphica
403800501_11_a
Huh?
You two are acting real weird.
Sphica
403800501_10_a
Y-You're all right?!
Is everything okay?!
Kirito
403800501_9_a
Sphica?!
Asuna
403800501_8_a
Kirito
403800501_7_a
Asuna
403800501_6_a
Kirito!
Asuna!
Sphica
403800501_5_a
Well... I guess we can't put it
off any longer... We sh
Kirito
403800501_4_a
So...what do you want to do?
Asuna
403800501_3_a
Kirito
403800501_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Kirito, Sphica didn't log on
yesterday either...
Asuna
403800501_1_a
That might be a good idea...
Asuna
403800401_47_a
Maybe we should ask Chrysheight
for info.
Kirito
403800401_46_a
That might be for the best...
But let me think for a sec...
Kirito
403800401_45_a
Should we contact the admins
after all?
Asuna
403800401_44_a
Asuna
403800401_43_a
But...
What should we do?
Kirito
403800401_42_a
Strea
403800401_41_a
I see where you're coming from.
It's a big no-no to pry into other
players' lives: especially kids.
Rain
403800401_40_a
We thought it would be rude to
bring up real world talk in the
game.
Asuna
403800401_39_a
Kirito
403800401_38_a
Well, we wanted to...but...
Asuna
403800401_37_a
If you suspected she was sick,
why didn't you just ask her?
Strea
403800401_36_a
Kirito, you seem to be taking a
lot of logical leaps here.
Strea
403800401_35_a
Strea
403800401_34_a
Wh-What?! No way!!
Rain
403800401_33_a
So if she's not here, it could be
because she took a sudden,
terrible turn for the worse...
Kirito
403800401_32_a
Asuna
403800401_31_a
Well...we don't have any proof,
but we think Sphica's got a really
serious disease.
Kirito
403800401_30_a
Strea
403800401_29_a
H-Hey, what's with you two?
What's got you so panicked?
Rain
403800401_28_a
Asuna, we have to remain calm!
Kirito
403800401_27_a
Kirito, what do we do?!
Do you think something
happened to her?!
Asuna
403800401_26_a
Asuna
403800401_25_a
N-No... This could be bad, though!
Kirito
403800401_24_a
Kirito, Asuna, have you heard
anything?
Rain
403800401_23_a
Rain
403800401_22_a
What happened? Is she okay?
Strea
403800401_21_a
Yup. Sphica.
Kirito
403800401_20_a
Wait a sec!
This is from...
Asuna
403800401_19_a
"I can't make it on time.
I won't be able to come today."
Kirito
403800401_18_a
This is one of those auto-messages
sent out when someone isn't
available...
Kirito
403800401_17_a
Huh?
A message?
Asuna
403800401_16_a
Kirito
403800401_15_a
...
Asuna
403800401_14_a
Strea
403800401_13_a
Yeah, now that you mention it,
I don't see her. Where could
she be?
Rain
403800401_12_a
We're supposed to go on a
five-person quest together today.
Asuna
403800401_11_a
Hey, where's Sphica?
Asuna
403800401_9_a
Kirito
403800401_10_a
Rain
403800401_8_a
Nah, no worries!
We just got here!
Strea
403800401_7_a
Asuna
403800401_6_a
Hey Strea, Rain.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Kirito
403800401_5_a
Strea
403800401_4_a
Over here!
Rain
403800401_3_a
Rain
403800401_2_a
bg_21_alne
Oh! Hi Asuna! Hi Kirito!
How's it hanging?!
Strea
403800401_1_a
Yeah... You're right.
Asuna
403800301_19_a
Let's just smile and play with her
like normal. That's the best thing
we can do for her.
Kirito
403800301_18_a
We're both curious, but we should
just leave the matter be for now.
Kirito
403800301_17_a
I'm with you there, Asuna.
Kirito
403800301_16_a
She always seems so carefree here.
I don't want to bring the real
world into her VR playground...
Asuna
403800301_15_a
I really want to know, but it'd
be so rude to just ask her.
And cruel...
Asuna
403800301_14_a
What...sort of disease do you
think she has?
Asuna
403800301_13_a
Exactly, which means she's not
going to school.
Kirito
403800301_12_a
people said she would often log on
in the middle of the day during
a school week...
Asuna
403800301_11_a
Come to think of it, when she got
a reputation as a hiding master,
Asuna
403800301_10_a
Even more strange, her guardian
seems to be fine with letting her
dive in the middle of the night.
Kirito
403800301_9_a
Yeah. I've been wondering why a
girl Sphica's age was playing ALO.
She's too young for it.
Kirito
403800301_8_a
It does?
Asuna
403800301_7_a
I'm really surprised too.
But to be honest, it makes sense.
Kirito
403800301_6_a
Asuna...
I know what you're thinking.
Kirito
403800301_5_a
Which means that in the real
world, Sphica's...
Asuna
403800301_4_a
Yeah. "Medicuboid."
The medical VR machine.
Kirito
403800301_3_a
Kirito
403800301_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
So Kirito, what Sphica said back
there...
Asuna
403800301_1_a
Kirito...
Asuna
403800201_23_a
Yay! More games!
Sphica
403800201_22_a
N-Now who's up for another round
of hide-and-seek! I'm it this time!
Kirito
403800201_21_a
H-Hey! Asuna, forget it!
Nothing's wrong, Sphica!
Kirito
403800201_20_a
Did you just say...Medi
Asuna
403800201_19_a
What's wrong, guys?
Sphica
403800201_18_a
Does that mean
Kirito
403800201_17_a
Wait...what?
Asuna
403800201_16_a
Kirito
403800201_15_a
Asuna
403800201_14_a
Yeah! It's just like that
Mediqoobood I'm always in!
Sphica
403800201_13_a
Hehe, excellent idea, Sphica.
It's pretty cool inside.
Asuna
403800201_12_a
It really was a good spot!
It's probably a great place
to nap on a hot day too!
Sphica
403800201_11_a
I thought it was just a rock,
but it's hollow. I never thought
anyone would find me in there!
Asuna
403800201_10_a
Yeah. I found it by total chance
when I was exploring these woods.
Asuna
403800201_9_a
I'm still impressed you found her.
That shell-like rock Asuna hid
under is the perfect hiding place.
Kirito
403800201_8_a
Hehe, that's right!
I'm a hide-and-seek master!
Sphica
403800201_7_a
Sphica's just way too good at
hiding AND finding!
Asuna
403800201_6_a
Ha ha, Sphica found you in like
five seconds too, huh?
Kirito
403800201_5_a
Aww, she got me...
Asuna
403800201_4_a
Kirito
403800201_3_a
Asuna
403800201_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
Found you, Asuna!
Sphica
403800201_1_a
I see...
Yui
403800101_30_a
I've gotten into the bad habit of
sticking my nose into other
people's business... Hahaha.
Kirito
403800101_29_a
Hmm... It really is bothering me,
but I guess I'll just have to let
it go for now.
Kirito
403800101_28_a
So what will you do?
Yui
403800101_27_a
But it's not like anything
happened to justify bringing
this to him...
Kirito
403800101_26_a
If this was something like that
incident with Death Gun, I could
ask Kikuoka
I mean, Chrysheight...
Kirito
403800101_25_a
No, that wouldn't be cool.
It's not right to barge into other
players' private lives like that.
Kirito
403800101_24_a
Do you think we should contact
the admins?
Yui
403800101_23_a
Ah, I see your point.
That does seem strange.
Yui
403800101_22_a
It's just past 11 PM. Aren't
her parents keeping an eye
on her?
Kirito
403800101_21_a
That too. But I also think it's
strange that she'd be diving
at this hour.
Kirito
403800101_20_a
So you think she's too young to
be playing VRMMOs?
Yui
403800101_19_a
Yeah. She told us a bit ago that
she's only eleven.
Kirito
403800101_18_a
You mean Sphica?
Yui
403800101_17_a
Well, sort of... Something's
been bothering me about her...
Kirito
403800101_16_a
Kirito
403800101_15_a
Daddy, is something the matter?
Yui
403800101_14_a
...
Kirito
403800101_13_a
Asuna
403800101_12_a
Yay!
Sphica
403800101_11_a
Well, in that case, let's play!
Asuna
403800101_10_a
Nope! I took a big nap earlier,
so I'm not sleepy at all!
Sphica
403800101_9_a
Shouldn't you be heading to
bed soon?
Asuna
403800101_8_a
Yeah! Of course we will!
But, Sphica, isn't it pretty
late for you to be up?
Asuna
403800101_7_a
Will you guys play with me today?!
Sphica
403800101_6_a
She's that little Imp girl we
met recently, right? The one
scarily good at hide-and-seek.
Kirito
403800101_5_a
Oh, it's Sphica!
Asuna
403800101_4_a
Kirito
403800101_3_a
Asuna
403800101_2_a
bg_21_alne_night
Kiritooo!
Asunaaa!
Sphica
403800101_1_a
Rain
403701201_39_a
Oh yeeeah!
Seven
403701201_38_a
Yeah! Let's do this!
Yuuki
403701201_37_a
Sinon
403701201_36_a
Yuuki
403701201_35_a
Hehe. Well, guys, it looks like
we can finally all get started
on the maid quests!
Asuna
403701201_34_a
I know, I knoooow!
Seven
403701201_33_a
You don't want to miss your
flight back to the States!
Rain
403701201_32_a
I like your passion, Seven, but
don't forget to keep an eye
on the time.
Rain
403701201_31_a
Me and Rain are gonna train hard
and bring up all our maid skills!
Seven
403701201_30_a
Alright!
It's time to get serious!
Seven
403701201_29_a
Seven
403701201_28_a
At any rate, all's well that
ends well, and now we can all
be maids!
Rain
403701201_27_a
They must have belonged to
her late husband.
Yuuki
403701201_26_a
I see... So when she said the
plates I broke were the master's
favorite...
Yuuki
403701201_25_a
So that's why you keep working
as a maid even as a noblewoman!
Asuna
403701201_24_a
The master lives on in my heart...
And as his maid, I will remain
devoted to him as long as I live.
Head Maid
403701201_23_a
I can't imagine the other
nobles took kindly to that...
Sinon
403701201_22_a
So when the master of the estate
married a maid, she became part
of the nobility.
Sinon
403701201_21_a
Asuna
403701201_20_a
Sinon
403701201_19_a
I see... So in the end, you were
the one who inherited the estate,
right, madam?
Yuuki
403701201_18_a
Left alone in the estate, I gave
birth to his only child.
Head Maid
403701201_17_a
The master and I fell in love...
but unfortunately he soon passed
away.
Head Maid
403701201_16_a
I was once a humble maid
at this very estate.
Head Maid
403701201_15_a
Seven
403701201_14_a
But... madam...
Rain
403701201_13_a
Yuuki
403701201_12_a
Really?
That's a relief.
Asuna
403701201_11_a
That should help clear up the
local unrest that has dogged us
lately.
Head Maid
403701201_10_a
And after questioning that
kidnapper, we were able to
work out the nobles behind this.
Head Maid
403701201_9_a
Ha ha! Yeah, it's so satisfying
to make it this far.
Yuuki
403701201_8_a
Hehe! So we finally get to be
maids after all.
Sinon
403701201_7_a
Woohoo!
Leafa
403701201_6_a
Any of you who failed the maid
test are now welcome to join
our staff.
Head Maid
403701201_5_a
Yuuki
403701201_4_a
Sinon
403701201_3_a
Leafa
403701201_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
I can't begin to express how
grateful I am. Thank you!
Head Maid
403701201_1_a
Whaaaaaaaat?!
Yuuki
403701101_28_a
Sinon
403701101_27_a
Yuuki
403701101_26_a
Hehe! I figured it out before
the battle. The head maid...
is the master of the estate.
Asuna
403701101_25_a
Does that mean the head maid is
that boy's mother?
Seven
403701101_24_a
Rain
403701101_23_a
Huh?
Wh-What's going on?
Seven
403701101_22_a
Yuuki
403701101_21_a
Mommy's here... You must have
been so scared... Thank goodness
you're safe...
Head Maid
403701101_20_a
M-Mommy!!!
Child
403701101_19_a
Sinon
403701101_18_a
Yuuki
403701101_17_a
Asuna
403701101_16_a
Oh! My darling boy!
???
403701101_15_a
Sinon
403701101_14_a
Yuuki
403701101_13_a
But we can't just go dragging
an NPC around...
Asuna
403701101_12_a
Seven
403701101_11_a
Well, now that we caught him,
should we bring him back to
the estate with us?
Rain
403701101_10_a
Yuuki
403701101_9_a
Ah, that makes sense.
Asuna
403701101_8_a
Oh! Could it be...we're supposed
to make him talk and figure out
the noble family behind this?
Leafa
403701101_7_a
Is there something left
to do in this event?
Sinon
403701101_6_a
We defeated this NPC,
but he's not disappearing...
Yuuki
403701101_5_a
Dammit...
Kidnapper
403701101_4_a
Sinon
403701101_3_a
Yuuki
403701101_2_a
bg_event_remains
Alright! We did it!
Asuna
403701101_1_a
You got no shame at all, do ya!
Kidnapper
403701001_51_a
Just worry about saving the kid!
Asuna
403701001_50_a
What the...!?
Y-You...!
You double-crossed me!
Kidnapper
403701001_49_a
He's bound and gagged!
Poor little guy...
We're gonna save you!
Leafa
403701001_48_a
Mngh!
Mnnngh!!
Child
403701001_47_a
Sinon
403701001_46_a
Asuna
403701001_45_a
There's the kid!
Yuuki
403701001_44_a
Huh?!
Kidnapper
403701001_43_a
Hraaagh!!
Leafa
403701001_42_a
Yaaaah!!
Yuuki
403701001_41_a
Sinon
403701001_40_a
Yuuki
403701001_39_a
Yuuki!
Leafa!
Now!!
Asuna
403701001_38_a
So whaddya say...?
Up for a deal?
Kidnapper
403701001_37_a
Yeah...
Any second now...
Asuna
403701001_36_a
Asuna...
He's coming this way...
Yuuki
403701001_35_a
...
Asuna
403701001_34_a
Heh heh heh...
Kidnapper
403701001_33_a
What say we make a deal?
If you're interested, I guarantee
we'll make a killing.
Kidnapper
403701001_32_a
Sinon
403701001_31_a
Yuuki
403701001_30_a
Huh?
Asuna
403701001_29_a
Heh, figures... Hey, listen.
Wanna make some quick cash?
Kidnapper
403701001_28_a
Seven
403701001_27_a
Um...
Rain
403701001_26_a
Yuuki
403701001_25_a
How long are you gonna
stick around gawking?!
Kidnapper
403701001_24_a
Asuna...?
Yuuki
403701001_23_a
The head maid...
Asuna
403701001_22_a
Yeah... Just like the head maid
thought...
Yuuki
403701001_21_a
This has got to be the work
of a rival noble family!
Sinon
403701001_20_a
Sinon
403701001_19_a
Yuuki
403701001_18_a
...New noblewoman?
Asuna
403701001_17_a
So I got reeled into doing
all the dirty work.
Kidnapper
403701001_16_a
Damn upstarts... My employer can't
stand that new noblewoman...
Kidnapper
403701001_15_a
I took a stupid job
'cuz I wanted the money.
Kidnapper
403701001_14_a
What a pain in the...
Tch. Fine.
Kidnapper
403701001_13_a
What are YOU guys doing here?
Asuna
403701001_12_a
W-We're a group of adventurers
on a tour of local dungeons!
Asuna
403701001_11_a
Don't make me say it again!
Who the hell are you guys?!
Kidnapper
403701001_10_a
There's a door behind that guy...
Maybe that's where they're hiding
the hostage.
Sinon
403701001_9_a
Yeah... Let's go help the boy
before anyone realizes what's up.
Leafa
403701001_8_a
So far, so good... Looks like
the kidnapper doesn't know we're
from the estate...
Yuuki
403701001_7_a
Tch... Who the hell are you
guys? What are you doin' here?
Kidnapper
403701001_6_a
Aha! That's gotta be the
kidnapper!
Asuna
403701001_5_a
Sinon
403701001_4_a
Yuuki
403701001_3_a
Asuna
403701001_2_a
bg_event_remains
Hey! Who goes there?
???
403701001_1_a
Yeah, I'm sure of it!
Asuna
403700901_37_a
But once we bring his son back
safe and sound, I'm sure we will!
Yuuki
403700901_36_a
Whoa, really? So you haven't
met him either...
Sinon
403700901_35_a
Hahaha. Well, that's understandable.
After all, I haven't even seen
the master.
Asuna
403700901_34_a
Aww, me too! The most I thought
about the estate master was, "Oh
right, we have one of those..."
Yuuki
403700901_33_a
was getting to try on
those cute maid clothes...
Leafa
403700901_32_a
Ha ha! Same here...
All I could think about
Leafa
403700901_31_a
Blargh... If it's grading us on
those emotions, then I don't
think I'll ever pass that test.
Sinon
403700901_30_a
Yuuki
403700901_29_a
Sinon
403700901_28_a
True. Plus, the AmuSphere can
pick up on your emotions...
Asuna
403700901_27_a
Even if this is just an event in a
virtual world, you shouldn't forget
the maid's spirit of devotion!
Rain
403700901_26_a
It's the same spirit here. It's no
fun if you don't put your heart
into it!
Rain
403700901_25_a
Even if calling customers "Master"
was just playing make-believe,
that's what made it fun.
Rain
403700901_24_a
Seven
403700901_23_a
She has a point, Asuna. It's just
like when I was working at that
maid cafe in the real world.
Rain
403700901_22_a
Yuuki
403700901_21_a
Ehehe... It's nothing special...
Asuna
403700901_20_a
Ah, there's the Asuna spirit! You
only just became a maid, but you're
already putting your heart in it!
Leafa
403700901_19_a
As a maid in the service of the
family...I've got to save that
poor kid!
Asuna
403700901_18_a
Alright! I'm ready for anything.
Yuuki
403700901_17_a
Sinon
403700901_16_a
Yuuki
403700901_15_a
Seven... Regardless of whether you
get to be a maid or not, the point
is to save the master's little boy.
Asuna
403700901_14_a
Hehe! But if this all goes well,
I'll finally get to be a maid!
Seven
403700901_13_a
Well, that's definitely the idea,
but that wording sounds a little...
Well...
Rain
403700901_12_a
Rain
403700901_11_a
So if we get enough points from
the kid-rescue thing, does that
mean we get to be maids after all?
Seven
403700901_10_a
Yuuki
403700901_9_a
They probably have it here so
players who fail the maid skills
test can still enjoy the event.
Leafa
403700901_8_a
We'll probably clear this side
quest when we save the boy.
Leafa
403700901_7_a
But it sure worked out
in our favor.
Sinon
403700901_6_a
Ha ha, that's right! Though it is
a real crisis for the estate...
Asuna
403700901_5_a
Looks like we get to do a battle
quest after all!
Yuuki
403700901_4_a
Sinon
403700901_3_a
Leafa
403700901_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
Alright! Let's show them
what we've got!
Yuuki
403700901_1_a
Oh yeah!
Now we're talking!
Yuuki
403700801_35_a
Got it! We're being sent on a
hostage rescue mission, right?
Sinon
403700801_34_a
Perhaps you could...
Head Maid
403700801_33_a
And Miss Asuna and Miss Rain
haven't been here long...
Head Maid
403700801_32_a
Uh, y-you mean us?
Um, not as such...
Although we wanted to be...
Leafa
403700801_31_a
Of course! You girls...
You're not maids here, are you?
Head Maid
403700801_30_a
Aha! In that case...!
Asuna
403700801_29_a
If anyone working for the estate
were recognized, it could make
matters worse...
Head Maid
403700801_28_a
Well then... Who's going to
take down those kidnappers?
Yuuki
403700801_27_a
Talk about trouble with the
neighbors...
Asuna
403700801_26_a
Everything was polite on the
surface, but behind the scenes,
they conspired and murdered.
Sinon
403700801_25_a
But these kinds of things happened
all the time between noble
families in the olden days.
Sinon
403700801_24_a
Yuuki
403700801_23_a
Sinon
403700801_22_a
Oh, that's terrible!
Leafa
403700801_21_a
Rain
403700801_20_a
So it's out of jealousy?
Seven
403700801_19_a
Yuuki
403700801_18_a
In recent years, this estate has
continued to grow in wealth and
status, inspiring resentment...
Head Maid
403700801_17_a
Sinon
403700801_16_a
Yuuki
403700801_15_a
The neighboring nobles did this?
Asuna
403700801_14_a
In the master's opinion, it may be
the underhanded tactics of the
neighboring noble families.
Maid
403700801_13_a
Recently, someone has been
harassing this estate.
Head Maid
403700801_12_a
Seven
403700801_11_a
Huh...? Why's that?
Rain
403700801_10_a
Yuuki
403700801_9_a
But to be honest, I don't think
paying them would settle
everything...
Head Maid
403700801_8_a
The culprit's motives? Well,
they're demanding ransom money.
Head Maid
403700801_7_a
...Excuse me. Do you know
the culprit's motives?
Asuna
403700801_6_a
To think anyone would kidnap
the poor young master...
Maid
403700801_5_a
Sinon
403700801_4_a
Yuuki
403700801_3_a
Asuna
403700801_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
My goodness! How can this be?!
Head Maid
403700801_1_a
Wh-What?!
Head Maid
403700701_38_a
Just now...the master's son...
He's been kidnapped!
Maid
403700701_37_a
What a ruckus!
What's the trouble?
Head Maid
403700701_36_a
That person's an NPC, right?
Is an event starting?
Sinon
403700701_35_a
A maid just rushed out
of the estate....
Yuuki
403700701_34_a
Sinon
403700701_33_a
Yuuki
403700701_32_a
Hm? What happened...?
Leafa
403700701_31_a
Madam!
Terrible news!
???
403700701_30_a
Speak for yourself! That's not
my strong suit either...
Seven
403700701_29_a
Sinon
403700701_28_a
Leafa
403700701_27_a
If there were some way to become
a maid by winning battles, we'd
all be set...
Yuuki
403700701_26_a
Maybe this is as close as
we're going to get...
Sinon
403700701_25_a
Yuuki
403700701_24_a
Sinon
403700701_23_a
Aw, come on... We're back
where we started, seeing off
the winner at the gate!
Leafa
403700701_22_a
Right away, ma'am!
Rain
403700701_21_a
Miss Rain!
Back to work, if you please.
Head Maid
403700701_20_a
Seven
403700701_19_a
Yeah, that's what I think.
Rain
403700701_18_a
Yuuki
403700701_17_a
Leafa
403700701_16_a
I see... So in the end, it's
not just the maid skills that
they assess...
Sinon
403700701_15_a
Plus they also seem to judge you
based on other things like
manners and deportment.
Rain
403700701_14_a
Well, that may be true, but a
parlor maid is like a waitress,
right? That's like my old job.
Rain
403700701_13_a
Rain
403700701_12_a
Why did they only hire my sister?!
If you look at the maid skills on
average, my levels are all higher!
Seven
403700701_11_a
Yuuki
403700701_9_a
Ha ha! I had a feeling this
might happen...
Leafa
403700701_8_a
Sinon
403700701_10_a
Wh-Wh-What?!
Seven
403700701_7_a
As for you, Miss Seven...
You failed the test. Please
try again some other time.
Head Maid
403700701_6_a
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Rain
403700701_5_a
Your duties will be greeting and
serving guests as a parlor maid.
Head Maid
403700701_4_a
Seven
403700701_3_a
Rain
403700701_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Well done, Miss Rain.
You are qualified to work here.
Head Maid
403700701_1_a
Don't worry! We won't know unless
we try! Now let's head to
that estate!
Seven
403700601_51_a
I'm in the same position as
you guys. All my skills are in
combat...
Rain
403700601_50_a
B-But still, hearing that
makes me kind of nervous...
Rain
403700601_49_a
Seven
403700601_48_a
Well, that sounds like Asuna,
alright.
Rain
403700601_47_a
So that means she also maxed
out her kitchen maid skills.
Yuuki
403700601_46_a
For example, Asuna maxed
out her cooking skills.
Yuuki
403700601_45_a
Leafa
403700601_44_a
Sinon
403700601_43_a
Nope! They're based on your
current skill parameters.
Yuuki
403700601_42_a
Seven
403700601_41_a
Wow, look at that...
Are the stats set randomly?
Rain
403700601_40_a
Yuuki
403700601_39_a
The maid skills tab won't show
up until you accept the quest.
Sinon
403700601_38_a
Leafa
403700601_37_a
Yuuki
403700601_36_a
Alright. Let's do this.
Sinon
403700601_35_a
I-I guess so.
Rain
403700601_34_a
That way, you can see for yourself
whether your experience helps out
at the estate, right?
Seven
403700601_33_a
Either way, we should go try out
this maid quest ourselves!
Seven
403700601_32_a
I get the feeling that the work
you do in this maid event is
pretty different from a maid cafe...
Rain
403700601_31_a
Seven
403700601_30_a
Y-Yeah, I appreciate that, but...
Rain
403700601_29_a
who better to ask for advice
than a seasoned pro?
Yuuki
403700601_28_a
So if we want to do well
in this quest,
Yuuki
403700601_27_a
Leafa
403700601_26_a
Yuuki
403700601_25_a
Rain, you used to have a part time
job at a maid cafe in the real
world, right?
Sinon
403700601_24_a
Seven
403700601_23_a
Huh?!
Rain
403700601_22_a
Sinon
403700601_21_a
Yuuki
403700601_20_a
Rain, this might be a little
sudden but... But...
Teach us how to be maids! Please!
Leafa
403700601_19_a
Rain
403700601_18_a
Oh yeah!
Seven
403700601_17_a
Sinon
403700601_16_a
Leafa
403700601_15_a
Yeah?
Then let's work hard together!
Yuuki
403700601_14_a
And that maid event looked so fun
I wanted to give it a try too!
Seven
403700601_13_a
Seven
403700601_12_a
Yeah! I just got to Japan.
Rain
403700601_11_a
Leafa
403700601_9_a
We were waiting for Rain.
Did you come with her, Seven?
Sinon
403700601_8_a
Yuuki
403700601_10_a
Seven
403700601_7_a
Hahaha!
Rain
403700601_6_a
Yuuki
403700601_5_a
Sinon
403700601_4_a
What?
Seven?
Leafa
403700601_3_a
Rain
403700601_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Privyet!
Seven
403700601_1_a
Then again...I've got it!
I know just the person to ask!
Sinon
403700501_33_a
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Sinon
403700501_32_a
Liz and Silica are both
too busy to help, as well.
Leafa
403700501_31_a
but I guess that's out of the
question this time.
Yuuki
403700501_30_a
This is the kind of thing I'd
usually ask Asuna for help with,
Yuuki
403700501_29_a
Ha ha... I guess you've
got a point.
Leafa
403700501_28_a
I'm just being realistic...
Besides, that comment applies to
me too!
Sinon
403700501_27_a
Jeez, Sinon!
That's a bit harsh!
Leafa
403700501_26_a
The three of us? Well...
I'm honestly a bit worried...
Sinon
403700501_25_a
For most players, regular cooking
and cleaning should do the
trick, but...
Sinon
403700501_24_a
So, how exactly are we
supposed to train?
Leafa
403700501_23_a
Sinon
403700501_22_a
Leafa
403700501_21_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
sigh
...
Yuuki
403700501_20_a
Y-Yes, ma'am...
Asuna
403700501_19_a
Well then, Miss Asuna.
Back to work.
Head Maid
403700501_18_a
Okay! It'll be lonely without you
guys, but I'll do my best until
you get back!
Asuna
403700501_17_a
Oh, yeah, that's right...
Asuna
403700501_16_a
Just wait a little longer, Asuna!
Yuuki
403700501_15_a
Th-That's right! We'll go train
and bring up our levels, then
take the test again!
Yuuki
403700501_14_a
We can go back and grind our
maid skills, then try again from
the beginning.
Sinon
403700501_13_a
Of course not, Asuna.
Sinon
403700501_12_a
So...do I have to do
this as a solo quest?
Asuna
403700501_11_a
Jeez...
Leafa
403700501_10_a
Only Miss Asuna will be
joining our staff.
Head Maid
403700501_9_a
Unfortunately, you three do not
meet the standards for working
at this estate.
Head Maid
403700501_8_a
H-How is that even possible...?
Asuna
403700501_7_a
I'm so ashamed...
Sinon
403700501_6_a
Sorry, Asuna...
Yuuki
403700501_5_a
Yeah...
Leafa
403700501_4_a
Sinon
403700501_3_a
Yuuki
403700501_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
What?!
You failed EVERYTHING?
Asuna
403700501_1_a
You guys... The sooner you quit
grumbling, the sooner we
can finish.
Sinon
403700401_34_a
I guess we lose points for that...
Leafa
403700401_33_a
Ack, we got in trouble again!
Yuuki
403700401_32_a
Focus on the tasks at hand! Don't
forget, girls, this is part of
your test.
Head Maid
403700401_31_a
There you go again, girls!
Nattering on amongst yourselves!
Head Maid
403700401_30_a
Asuna's kitchen maid skills must
be really high, then...
Sinon
403700401_29_a
It says here that your maid skills
are based on the skill parameters
that you already have.
Sinon
403700401_28_a
Me too... If these are our stats,
I'd be interested to see how
Asuna is doing.
Leafa
403700401_27_a
...Same here.
Sinon
403700401_26_a
Whoa! What the...? All my stats
are still only at one...
Yuuki
403700401_25_a
Maybe these are supposed to be
special stats limited to just
this event?
Leafa
403700401_24_a
Lady's maid, parlor maid, laundry
maid... Wow. There sure are a lot
of different maid skills.
Sinon
403700401_23_a
Huh? It says...
"Maid Skills List"?
Sinon
403700401_22_a
Leafa
403700401_21_a
Sinon
403700401_20_a
Ah! Look at this, you guys!
Something weird just got added
to our statuses!
Yuuki
403700401_19_a
Making sweets probably does.
Leafa
403700401_18_a
So does this job come down
to cooking skills too?
Sinon
403700401_17_a
Tasks include taking care of the
preserves, making sweets, and
pouring tea. Let's get started.
Head Maid
403700401_16_a
Isn't that obvious...?
Sinon
403700401_15_a
No way!
Leafa
403700401_14_a
Huh?
Yuuki
403700401_13_a
Though it goes without saying
that maids are not permitted to
sample any of the refreshments.
Head Maid
403700401_12_a
That sounds like a dream come true!
Leafa
403700401_11_a
Ooo!
Sweets!
Yuuki
403700401_10_a
The still-room maid is chiefly
responsible for the handling of
tea and sweets.
Head Maid
403700401_9_a
But there really are a lot
of specialized occupations.
Sinon
403700401_8_a
I know what you mean. These days,
you tend to imagine maids doing
housework across the board.
Sinon
403700401_7_a
It's still hard to believe there
are as many different types of
maids as she said.
Leafa
403700401_6_a
Still-room?
Yuuki
403700401_5_a
Sinon
403700401_4_a
Leafa
403700401_3_a
Yuuki
403700401_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Moving along...I will now explain
the role of the still-room maid.
Head Maid
403700401_1_a
Hehe...
Hang in there, guys!
Asuna
403700301_33_a
Well, Asuna, I guess we'll
see you around.
Leafa
403700301_32_a
Yes, ma'am...
Yuuki
403700301_31_a
Please find one that suits
your abilities best.
Head Maid
403700301_30_a
Lady's maids, chamber maids,
parlor maids, and a host of
many other roles.
Head Maid
403700301_29_a
Nothing to fret over, girls. We
shall find a role for you three
yet. Our estate's staff includes...
Head Maid
403700301_28_a
I guessed as much...
Yuuki
403700301_27_a
Yeah, figures...
Leafa
403700301_26_a
Aww...
Sinon
403700301_25_a
As for the rest of you... It would
appear that you aren't suited
to work as kitchen maids.
Head Maid
403700301_24_a
Really?
Awesome!
Asuna
403700301_23_a
Asuna
403700301_22_a
Sinon
403700301_21_a
Yuuki
403700301_20_a
Well, then... That's a passing
mark for you, Miss Asuna.
Head Maid
403700301_19_a
We're gonna get that
cooking done in no time!
Leafa
403700301_18_a
Asuna...
I like your attitude.
Leafa
403700301_17_a
So we'd better get the hang
of cooking quickly for a crowd.
Asuna
403700301_16_a
Along with the maids, there are
a lot of people living in this
estate.
Asuna
403700301_15_a
Come on, guys.
Let's pick up the pace.
Asuna
403700301_14_a
Geez... They really went
overboard on the realism.
Yuuki
403700301_13_a
If you make a mistake, the
plate gets broken...
Sinon
403700301_12_a
This quest might be set up so you
can play through the cooking
process, but...
Sinon
403700301_11_a
Why did they make this so difficult?
I normally don't break any plates
when I'm using my cooking skills.
Sinon
403700301_10_a
N-No way...!
Yuuki
403700301_9_a
The cost for what you break
will be taken from your salary.
Head Maid
403700301_8_a
This crockery set is the master's
favorite. Each and every plate
is extremely valuable!
Head Maid
403700301_7_a
Asuna
403700301_6_a
Sinon
403700301_5_a
Yuuki
403700301_4_a
Miss Yuuki! Just how many plates
do you feel compelled to destroy?
Head Maid
403700301_3_a
I broke another plate...
Yuuki
403700301_2_a
bg_s2_20_restaurant
Waaah!!
Yuuki
403700301_1_a
Hehe... Well, let's all do
our best anyway.
Asuna
403700201_22_a
Y-Yeah... We're all battle-focused
players, after all.
Leafa
403700201_21_a
I think we're all in the same
boat, Yuuki. Apart from Asuna,
at least...
Sinon
403700201_20_a
I wonder if I can do this...
I don't have any skills in
housekeeping or chores.
Yuuki
403700201_19_a
Leafa
403700201_18_a
Sinon
403700201_17_a
Yikes...
So it really is housework...
Yuuki
403700201_16_a
Based on the chores at which you
excel, I will assign you a role
in the house.
Head Maid
403700201_15_a
To start out with, let's
begin with a test.
Head Maid
403700201_14_a
Huh?!
Housework?!
Yuuki
403700201_13_a
Skills, huh...? But what kind of
"skills" does she mean? Things
like cleaning and housework?
Leafa
403700201_12_a
Phew...
Yuuki
403700201_11_a
If you work on raising your skills,
you may attempt this trial again
if you wish.
Head Maid
403700201_10_a
Yeah... Don't we get to retry?
Sinon
403700201_9_a
Whoa! She's so strict...
Asuna
403700201_8_a
With that in mind...
Head Maid
403700201_7_a
If you fail to show any promise as
a maid, I'm afraid you will be
asked to leave the estate.
Head Maid
403700201_6_a
The next few days will be a trial
period to determine whether you
are worthy of working here.
Head Maid
403700201_5_a
Yuuki
403700201_4_a
Sinon
403700201_3_a
Asuna
403700201_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
First of all...
Head Maid
403700201_1_a
I couldn't agree more...
Leafa
403700101_39_a
Anyway, with a battle-axe like
that in charge, we'd better
behave.
Sinon
403700101_38_a
Come here, girls. We're going to
go through the house rules step
by step.
Head Maid
403700101_37_a
Oh, I see...
Leafa
403700101_36_a
Sinon
403700101_35_a
Yuuki
403700101_34_a
Ha ha! She's probably programmed
to give that reaction if the
game detects our mouths moving.
Asuna
403700101_33_a
Leafa
403700101_32_a
Sinon
403700101_31_a
Yuuki
403700101_30_a
Girls!
Silence!
Head Maid
403700101_29_a
But can NPCs really understand
that much of what we're saying?

Yuuki, shh! You don't want her
to yell at us again, do you?
Sinon
403700101_27_a
Yikes...!
Sh-She's really scary...
Yuuki
403700101_26_a
Sinon
403700101_25_a
Yuuki
403700101_24_a
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Asuna
403700101_23_a
During your maid training,
idle chatter is strictly prohibited.
Keep that in mind!
Head Maid
403700101_22_a
Girls, girls!
Enough of your whispering.
Head Maid
403700101_21_a
Hehe! It sounds fun!
Yuuki
403700101_20_a
Huh... Well, this is a pretty
weird quest.
Leafa
403700101_19_a
Er... So does that mean we're
going to be working as maids
here?
Sinon
403700101_18_a
Sinon
403700101_17_a
Yuuki
403700101_16_a
New maids...?
Asuna
403700101_15_a
I will be in charge of your
training as new maids.
Head Maid
403700101_14_a
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am the head maid and housekeeper
of this estate.
???
403700101_13_a
No kidding. Does she work
in the mansion?
Yuuki
403700101_12_a
Whoa...
It's a maid NPC.
Asuna
403700101_9_a
Sinon
403700101_11_a
Yuuki
403700101_10_a
There you are, girls.
I've been expecting you.
???
403700101_8_a
That's for sure.
Asuna
403700101_7_a
I'm guessing we won't be battling
monsters here.
Leafa
403700101_6_a
But...what in the world are we
supposed to do in a mansion?
Sinon
403700101_5_a
Yeah. This must be the place.
Asuna
403700101_4_a
Sinon

Here we are! So this is the
new quest area.
Yuuki
403700101_1_a
Sounds great!
Kirito
403601201_21_a
We flew all the way out here,
so let's stick around and have
some fun!
Asuna
403601201_20_a
Yui
403601201_19_a
Kirito
403601201_18_a
You're right, Yuuki! There are so
many places we haven't explored
yet!
Asuna
403601201_17_a
And this time, we can just sit
back and enjoy them! No evil witch
using us to destroy the world!
Yuuki
403601201_16_a
Maybe if we keep exploring these
islands, we'll find them!
Yuuki
403601201_15_a
Hold up, guys! Aren't there
still tons of fairy tales we
haven't seen yet?
Yuuki
403601201_14_a
I was pretty shocked when I
found out we were being used
the whole time. Not cool.
Liz
403601201_13_a
And...no one make fun of me, but
I cried like ten times during
this quest!
Silica
403601201_12_a
Agreed. And even knowing the plot,
watching it play out in front of
you is pretty exciting.
Sinon
403601201_11_a
Sinon
403601201_9_a
Yeah, but it was really fun! And
it was a nice change of pace from
the usual fare.
Leafa
403601201_8_a
Silica
403601201_10_a
We're finished! That campaign
quest was really tough!
Asuna
403601201_7_a
Phew... And that's a wrap.
Kirito
403601201_6_a
I think that's a great idea,
Hansel! Let's start a new life
for ourselves!
Gretel

Look at all the treasure! Do you
think we can use it to make our
own way in the world, Gretel?
Hansel
403601201_1_a
Asuna
403601101_26_a
Yui
403601101_25_a
Seems so. All that's left now is
to see the final story to its end.
Kirito
403601101_24_a
Liz
403601101_23_a
Silica
403601101_22_a
So wait. Just checking: the witch
who gave us this campaign quest
was the last boss, right?
Leafa
403601101_21_a
You're right, Kirito. Sad stories
move us and teach us important
lessons about life.
Asuna
403601101_20_a
In the end, isn't that how we
really set the soul of a story
free?
Kirito
403601101_19_a
And we shouldn't try to. Whether
they're sad or painful, we have to
accept them for what they are.
Kirito
403601101_18_a
Even if we could change them here
in the game, we can't change them
out in the real world.
Kirito
403601101_17_a
Asuna
403601101_16_a
Yui
403601101_15_a
Maybe. But these fairy tales have
been around for hundreds and
hundreds of years.
Kirito
403601101_14_a
We might've worked to give them
all different, happier endings...
Silica
403601101_13_a
But if we only knew she intended
to misuse the power of these fairy
tales when we started...
Silica
403601101_12_a
You bet! At the very least, Hansel
and Gretel are safe now.
Yuuki
403601101_9_a
Sinon
403601101_11_a
Leafa
403601101_10_a
Did we do the right thing?
Asuna
403601101_8_a
...
Kirito
403601101_7_a
Nnnrrraaagh!!

My power...
My ambitions...
They fade...to dust!!

Kirito

Hah! Fools! I shall rip those
stories from your cold, dead
fingers! Muhahaha!
Witch
403601001_68_a
What's this? You've come so far
only to oppose me here? Now?!
Witch
403601001_67_a
I knew she was evil when she
dropped us out of the sky!
Get her!
Leafa

Sinon
403601001_65_a
Leafa
403601001_64_a
Kirito! Asuna! We have to stop
her!
Yuuki
403601001_63_a
That witch! She was evil from the
start!
Asuna
403601001_62_a
With it, I shall destroy these
islands! Muhahahaha!
Witch
403601001_61_a
Muhahaha! My true goal is power!
Incredible dark energy ripped from
these poor saps' souls!
Witch

Yui

You'll WHAT?!
Kirito
403601001_57_a
I'll convert them all into dark
magical energy.
Witch
403601001_56_a
Oh, one last thing. When I release
the twisted souls trapped in
these tales...
Witch
403601001_55_a
Sinon
403601001_54_a
Leafa
403601001_53_a
But doesn't that make her a bad
witch? She tries to eat Hansel
and Gretel!
Silica
403601001_52_a
Asuna
403601001_51_a
Yui
403601001_50_a
This is bad! She's gonna get
roasted!
Kirito
403601001_49_a
Yuuki
403601001_48_a
Leafa
403601001_47_a
Seriously? You mean to tell me
that she's Hansel and Gretel's
witch?!
Sinon
403601001_46_a
Wait. Waaaiiit... Is she walking
toward the candy house?
Asuna
403601001_45_a
That's good to hear. Well, I shall
retire to my cottage until you
finish.
Witch
403601001_44_a
Asuna
403601001_43_a
Yui
403601001_42_a
Yeah, that's right.
Kirito
403601001_41_a
It appears that you are nearly
finished with your task.
Witch
403601001_40_a
Well, we're on the second half of
the last story. Maybe she's just
checking in?
Liz
403601001_39_a
And why'd she pop out now?
Sinon
403601001_38_a
Yuuki
403601001_37_a
Sinon
403601001_36_a
It's the witch who gave us the
quest! What's she doing here?
Leafa
403601001_35_a
Asuna
403601001_34_a
Yui
403601001_33_a
AH!
Kirito
403601001_32_a
Hello again. How goes your quest?
???
403601001_31_a
Silica
403601001_30_a
Leafa
403601001_29_a
Still, this particular fairy tale
is pretty controversial. No one
knows for sure who that witch was.
Sinon
403601001_28_a
Ahaha, good point, Kirito!
Asuna
403601001_27_a
Asuna
403601001_26_a
Yui
403601001_25_a
Isn't that why that witch we met
wanted us to collect it? We record
it for her, and she saves it.
Kirito
403601001_24_a
Ick. What's with that? This fairy
tale's beyond saving.
Yuuki
403601001_23_a
Sometimes she's their real mom.
Other times, the witch they cook
is actually their real mom.
Sinon
403601001_22_a
This time, it was their "wicked
stepmother" who abandoned them,
but there are other variations.
Sinon
403601001_21_a
That's right. The mother's role
got completely revamped.
Sinon
403601001_20_a
Sinon
403601001_19_a
Leafa
403601001_18_a
B-But wasn't this story changed
quite a lot to make it a kid's
story?
Silica
403601001_17_a
Yup. It's one of the less gruesome
of Grimms' Fairy Tales. There's
actually a happy ending.
Liz
403601001_16_a
But they work together to trap the
witch in her own oven, then
escape back home.
Leafa
403601001_15_a
Silica
403601001_14_a
Leafa
403601001_13_a
Now they get caught by the wicked
old witch who owns that candy
cottage.
Sinon
403601001_12_a
Heh. We've reached the second
half of Hansel and Gretel's story.
Asuna
403601001_11_a
No problem.
Kirito
403601001_10_a
Thank you for showing us the way,
kind fairies!
Gretel
403601001_9_a
Gretel, let's go!
Hansel
403601001_8_a
Wow! A cottage made of candy!
We don't have to go hungry!

final story on Grimm Island.
But a surprise awaited us...)

(After that, everyone split up to
collect stories from the two
fairy tale islands.)

Yui
403600901_39_a
Yeah.
Kirito
403600901_38_a
Well, we're done here. Let's go
find the next fairy tale.
Sinon
403600901_37_a
Well, lesson learned or not,
that's just how the story goes.
Silica

Sinon
403600901_35_a
Leafa
403600901_34_a
Ahaha, who knows? I don't think
a single embarrassment would fix
his attitude!
Yuuki
403600901_33_a
Yui
403600901_32_a
Kirito
403600901_31_a
I just hope the Emperor learned
a lesson here and starts behaving
better...
Asuna
403600901_30_a
Silica
403600901_29_a
Leafa
403600901_28_a
I guess that means we added
The Emperor's New Clothes to our
collection.

Yeah... Cool.

Okay, no more standing around
moping! Let's get out there and
find the next fairy tale!
Leafa
403600601_37_a
Thanks, Yui. I guess we know
how to get the rest now.
Kirito
403600601_36_a
We've collected our first
fairy tale.
Yui
403600601_35_a
Mommy, Daddy. This story appeared
on our list of finished quests.
Yui
403600601_34_a
sniff
I knew what was going to
happen, but I'm still gonna cry...
Asuna
403600601_33_a
I'm so warm now...
The Little Match Girl
403600601_32_a
Take me with you, grandmother...
The Little Match Girl
403600601_31_a
I hope she's come to bring that
girl to heaven...

Asuna

It's not just a vision, Yuuki.
To her, it really is her beloved
grandmother.
Kirito
403600601_27_a
She's lit a match... She must be
seeing a vision in its light.
Yuuki
403600601_26_a
Ahh... Grandmother...
The Little Match Girl

Yuuki

Look, everyone! That girl...

403600601_22_a
I think we'll just have to be a
good audience from here on out
and keep our hands to ourselves.
Kirito
403600601_21_a
Yui
403600601_20_a
Kirito
403600601_19_a
Yeah, but it's no use complaining.
Asuna

Grr, that's SO MEAN!
Silica
403600601_17_a
Sinon
403600601_16_a
Leafa
403600601_15_a
But does that mean we really can't
do anything but watch these
fairy tales?
Silica

Asuna

Yui
403600601_12_a
I think they spawned because we
were trying to change the story.
Kirito
403600601_11_a

They were total jerks! All we did
was buy a match!

403600501_52_a
Yeah...
Asuna
403600501_51_a
I'm happy. You put a smile on
her face, Asuna.
Kirito
403600501_50_a
You're very welcome.
Asuna
403600501_49_a
So there is kindness in this
world... Thank you... Thank you
so much!
The Little Match Girl
403600501_48_a
Here you go!
Asuna
403600501_47_a
Y-You'll buy a match?! Th-Thank
you very much! That will be
1 Yuld!
The Little Match Girl
403600501_46_a
Excuse me, little girl. One match,
please.
Asuna
403600501_45_a
Would you care for a match?
The Little Match Girl
403600501_44_a
Alright!
Asuna
403600501_43_a
You're right, Asuna. I think it
should be okay. Let's go buy a
match.
Kirito
403600501_42_a
It won't change the ending, but it
might make her last moments a
little more happy...
Asuna
403600501_41_a
Yui
403600501_40_a
Kirito
403600501_39_a
But Kirito... Can't we at least
buy one match?
Asuna
403600501_38_a
Silica
403600501_37_a
Sinon
403600501_36_a
O-Okay...
Leafa
403600501_35_a
All we can do for her right now is
watch her story end...and never
forget it.
Kirito
403600501_34_a
Asuna
403600501_33_a
Yui
403600501_32_a
Exactly. I know it hurts, but we
shouldn't interfere.
Kirito
403600501_31_a
Oh... I guess you're right...
Leafa
403600501_30_a
So unless we want to give up on
this whole quest, we're just going
to have to grin and bear it.
Sinon
403600501_29_a
Leafa, chill out. Kirito's right.
We can't free them from suffering
if we give them a happy ending.
Sinon
403600501_28_a
Silica
403600501_27_a
Sinon
403600501_26_a
Kirito, you inhuman jerk! How
could you say that?!
Leafa
403600501_25_a
but I think we should probably
just bear with it and watch the
story as it was meant to be.
Kirito
403600501_24_a
I wouldn't be surprised if player
actions could change the script,
Kirito
403600501_23_a
Asuna
403600501_22_a
Yui
403600501_21_a
Silica, I'm not sure if that's
a good idea...

Leafa

That's so sad... Kirito,
can't we do anything for her?
Silica

Yui

Kirito
403600501_15_a
sniff
...
Even the summary makes me want
to cry...
Asuna
403600501_14_a
Before she freezes to death, she
sees her dear, dead grandma, who
guides her up to heaven. The end.
Liz
403600501_13_a
Finally, she gets so cold she
lights a match and sees visions
of a warm and happy life.
Liz
403600501_12_a
She walks to and fro in the wintry
night, pleading in vain for
someone to buy one.
Liz
403600501_11_a
Seriously. The poor girl's cruel
father tells her not to come home
until she sells her matches.
Liz
403600501_10_a
Leafa
403600501_9_a
Liz
403600501_8_a
Yeah, this story is really sad.
Yuuki
403600501_7_a
Our first fairy tale turned out to
be a realllly depressing one...
Kirito

The Little Match Girl...

Yui

Kirito
403600401_23_a
Maybe we already stepped into
a fairy tale?
Asuna
403600401_22_a
And the second we got here,
day turned to night...
Sinon

Sounds good.
Kirito

Well, let's get going! I want to
find a Hans Christian Andersen
fairy tale!

Cool. Thanks, Yui.

This would be Andersen Island.

Small comforts. So, which island
did we land on?

But, but... Waaah!
Leafa
403600301_56_a
Asuna
403600301_55_a
Yui
403600301_54_a
Sorry, Sugu. No lighthearted romps
through happy forests here.
Kirito
403600301_53_a
Hold up! Torment and despair?!
What happened to my magical and
romantic fairy tale adventures?!
Leafa
403600301_52_a
That would seem to be in line with
this event's theme.
Liz
403600301_51_a
Leafa
403600301_50_a
Liz
403600301_49_a
So take part in a lot of fairy
tales and watch their endings.
Got it.
Yuuki
403600301_48_a
I guess that makes sense...
Asuna
403600301_47_a
and watch them unfold. That should
somehow release the spirits of the
characters from their suffering.
Kirito
403600301_46_a
In other words, I think what she
wants us to do is find fairy tales
with elements of sadness and pain,
Kirito
403600301_45_a
Asuna
403600301_44_a
Yui
403600301_43_a
Right. Remember what the witch
said? She wanted us to free "souls
twisted by torment and despair."
Kirito
403600301_42_a
On the other hand, Hans Christian
Andersen's fairy tales are all
sad, like The Little Mermaid.
Silica
403600301_41_a
But they're really gruesome,
brutal, and cruel. That was a
shock to learn.
Liz
403600301_40_a
Leafa
403600301_39_a
Silica
403600301_38_a
When I was a kid, I thought that
Grimms' Fairy Tales were all happy
stories made for children.
Liz
403600301_37_a
Hmm...
Asuna
403600301_36_a
So let's assume that's true for
now. What sort of image do you
all have of these fairy tales?
Kirito
403600301_35_a
Yeah, that would make sense.
Asuna
403600301_34_a
Does that sound like a reasonable
enough assumption to you?
Kirito
403600301_33_a
Asuna
403600301_32_a
Yui
403600301_31_a
Maybe each island's events are
based off of the fairy tale
collection they're named after.
Kirito
403600301_30_a
Leafa
403600301_29_a
Yuuki
403600301_28_a
Yeah. Your point?
Sinon
403600301_27_a
That witch called these islands
"Andersen Island" and "Grimm
Island," right?
Kirito
403600301_26_a
Asuna
403600301_25_a
Yui
403600301_24_a
This is just a theory, but...

Yui
403600301_18_a
Hmm...
Kirito
403600301_17_a
Looks that way. But what in the
world was that old witch talking
about?
Leafa
403600301_16_a
I'm guessing this means we can't
fly during this quest chain.
Yuuki
403600301_15_a
Leafa

Yuuki

Next time I see that hag I'm gonna
give her a knuckle sandwich for

Yui

So in other words, you just want
us to collect a bunch of fairy
tales, right?
Kirito

Silica
403600201_43_a
Leafa
403600201_42_a
Collect stories to free souls?
Well, that doesn't make sense.
Sinon
403600201_41_a
By assembling these tales, I hope
to free souls twisted by torment
and despair.
Witch
403600201_40_a
I wish to collect the islands'
tales in my magical tome.
Witch
403600201_39_a
I think she's talking about the
fairy tales this area's themed on.
Kirito
403600201_38_a
Yui

Kirito
403600201_36_a
Legends and myths?

I am a collector of legends and
myths from the two islands you
see before you.
Witch

to ask!

Hehe, this really would've been
terrifying if we'd tried it back

Oh! There they are! I can see
the two new islands!
Yuuki

Yuuki

403600101_48_a
Huh?
Leafa
403600101_47_a
Asuna
403600101_46_a
Yui
403600101_45_a
Hmmm... I hope you're right...
Kirito
403600101_44_a
And just imagine it! A fairy tale
world filled with romance and
magic and adventure!!
Leafa
403600101_43_a
Yuuki
403600101_42_a
Liz
403600101_41_a
If this is all based on fairy
tales, I bet there's gonna be
lots of cute monsters!
Leafa
403600101_40_a
Asuna
403600101_39_a
Yui
403600101_38_a
Really? Why's that?
Kirito
403600101_37_a
Heh, you said it! But big update
or not, I'm SO excited for this!
Leafa
403600101_36_a
I'm with Liz! I'm excited to
see all of this new content!
Silica
403600101_35_a
Well, let's go and check them out
already!
Liz
403600101_34_a
Leafa
403600101_33_a
Liz
403600101_32_a
But that was only ONE! This time,
it's TWO! That's like, twice as
big! I'm crazy excited!
Yuuki
403600101_31_a
Interesting... There was a new
island for the Urashima Taro
event too.
Asuna
403600101_30_a
I should also add that this event
will take place on two new islands
in the sea south of Alfheim.
Yui
403600101_29_a
It automatically rearranges myths
from around the world into new
quests and events.
Kirito
403600101_28_a
Asuna
403600101_27_a
Yui
403600101_26_a
Yeah, that is true. I guess this
is what happens when Cardinal's
running the scenes.
Kirito
403600101_25_a
Liz
403600101_24_a
Leafa
403600101_23_a
But didn't we just have a weird
Urashima event in ALO? I don't see
why this would surprise you.
Yuuki
403600101_22_a
Asuna
403600101_21_a
Yui
403600101_20_a
Yeah. They're also from different
time periods, so I thought it was
odd to mash them together.
Kirito
403600101_19_a
Denmark is a Scandinavian country,
but Germany isn't. Is that what's
bothering you?
Silica
403600101_18_a
Yuuki
403600101_17_a
Leafa
403600101_16_a
Ahh, I think I see what you're
getting at.
Liz
403600101_15_a
Asuna
403600101_14_a
Yui
403600101_13_a
Exactly, and that's the problem.
As I see it, anyway.
Kirito
403600101_12_a
And the Grimms' Fairy Tales are
from Germany.
Leafa
403600101_11_a
Leafa
403600101_9_a
Hans Christian Andersen's stories
are based on Denmark's folktales.
Sinon
403600101_8_a
Silica
403600101_10_a
Aren't those
Kirito
403600101_7_a
Fairy tales, huh?
Kirito
403600101_6_a
Apparently, it uses fairy tales by
Hans Christian Andersen and
the Brothers Grimm.
Yui
403600101_5_a
That's correct. The next campaign
quest's theme is "fairy tales,"
and it has a lot of content.
Yui
403600101_4_a
Asuna
403600101_3_a
Yui
403600101_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
Fairy tales?
Kirito
403600101_1_a
Yui
403501201_30_a
Kirito, Asuna, Yui...
I just love you guys!
Strea
403501201_29_a
Asuna
403501201_28_a
Leafa
403501201_27_a
I'm happy to hear that.
Kirito
403501201_26_a
Hehehe!
Yui
403501201_25_a
And being away
from my big sis, too!
Strea
403501201_24_a
Strea
403501201_23_a
Yeah! There's no place like home!
Being away from Mommy and Daddy
really makes you realize that.
Yui
403501201_22_a
It's okay, though!
I like hanging out with you
guys the most, anyway!
Strea
403501201_21_a
Kirito
403501201_20_a
Leafa
403501201_19_a
Wow... Talk about getting your
fifteen minutes of social media fame.
Asuna
403501201_18_a
Asuna
403501201_17_a
Leafa
403501201_16_a
Wh-What the heck...
Kirito
403501201_15_a
It even sounds like they're gonna
make a Spartan Philia training
guild next.
Strea
403501201_14_a
They basically just dumped me
for her.
Strea
403501201_13_a
Nope! Well... I mean, they all kind
of started mooning over Philia
after her special training course.
Strea
403501201_12_a
So it wasn't something any of the
guild members did?
Asuna
403501201_9_a
Leafa
403501201_11_a
Kirito
403501201_10_a
Well, that kind of started it...
But really, I just got bored.
Strea
403501201_8_a
Asuna
403501201_7_a
Leafa
403501201_6_a
It's not because you lost that PVP
battle to us, is it?
Kirito
403501201_5_a
Yep, ahahaha...
Strea
403501201_4_a
Asuna
403501201_3_a
Kirito
403501201_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
No way! So the guild broke up
after that?
Leafa
403501201_1_a
Waaaaaaaah!
Strea
403501101_32_a
No! You're the glue that keeps
this guild together, you have to
stay!
Philia
403501101_31_a
I-I wanna go home toooo!
Strea
403501101_30_a
Strea
403501101_29_a
Thanks! Catch ya later.
Philia
403501101_28_a
Asuna
403501101_27_a
Kirito
403501101_26_a
Well, we're gonna head home now.
You guys have fun!
Leafa
403501101_25_a
Hehe, seriously.
Asuna
403501101_24_a
Asuna
403501101_23_a
Leafa
403501101_22_a
Haha, now Philia's all
about the guild!
Kirito
403501101_21_a
B-But...
Strea
403501101_20_a
Nooope, no backing out! You gotta
figure out how to work better
together for next time!
Philia
403501101_19_a
Wh-What...?
Nah, I'm good!
This was fun enough!
Strea
403501101_18_a
Right, then. How about we head
back for some post-quest
reflection time with your guild?
Philia
403501101_17_a
There...are?
Strea
403501101_16_a
Heheh! Well, there are a few things
that could use some work...
Philia
403501101_15_a
Yeah! It was nice of you to help
without even belonging to the
guild, Philia.
Strea
403501101_14_a
Honestly, I didn't think we'd even
get this far.
Philia
403501101_13_a
Strea
403501101_12_a
Hahaha! I thought so too,
if I do say so myself.
Philia
403501101_11_a
Kirito
403501101_9_a
Hehe, you guys put up a good fight
though! Especially considering you just formed
this party.
Leafa
403501101_8_a
Asuna
403501101_10_a
Don't worry, it's okay. Those guys
are pretty much impossible to beat.
Strea
403501101_7_a
I'm so sorry, Strea...
Sailor Strea Guild Member
403501101_6_a
Philia
403501101_5_a
Awww, we lost...!
Strea
403501101_4_a
Asuna
403501101_3_a
Leafa
403501101_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Alright, we won!
Kirito
403501101_1_a
Yeah, bring it on!
Asuna
403501001_45_a
Asuna
403501001_44_a
Leafa
403501001_43_a
Just try and beat us!
Kirito
403501001_42_a
Woooooo!
Sailor Strea Guild Member
403501001_41_a
The Sailor Strea fans work together
like a well-oiled machine!
Strea
403501001_40_a
Philia
403501001_39_a
I hope you guys are ready
to lose!
Strea
403501001_38_a
Asuna
403501001_37_a
Leafa
403501001_36_a
Okay...
So that's how it's going to be!
Kirito
403501001_35_a
Strea
403501001_34_a
Hehehe...
Philia
403501001_33_a
So in the end we decided to
do it as a sort of team-building
exercise...
Philia
403501001_32_a
Strea
403501001_31_a
Once that event was over,
I mentioned this quest, and everyone
got super excited...
Philia
403501001_30_a
Asuna
403501001_29_a
Leafa
403501001_28_a
You're here too, Philia?!
Kirito
403501001_27_a
Strea
403501001_26_a
My bad, Kirito...
Philia
403501001_25_a
Asuna
403501001_24_a
Leafa
403501001_23_a
Huh-wha...? You guys
were doing this quest too?
Kirito
403501001_22_a
Hahaha!
There you have it!
Strea
403501001_21_a
Strea
403501001_20_a
We're all part of the Sailor Strea
Fan Guild!
Sailor Strea Guild Member
403501001_19_a
Kirito
403501001_18_a
Leafa
403501001_17_a
And who are these people...?
Asuna
403501001_16_a
Kirito
403501001_15_a
Asuna
403501001_14_a
Strea?! What are you doing here?
Leafa
403501001_13_a
Ta-daaaaa!
Strea
403501001_12_a
Huh?!
Kirito
403501001_9_a
Leafa
403501001_11_a
Asuna
403501001_10_a
Kiritoooo! I found yooou!
???
403501001_8_a
A new guild...?
Kirito
403501001_7_a
Apparently they're all members of
this newly-formed guild...
Leafa
403501001_6_a
You say that, but they look pretty
tough...
Leafa
403501001_5_a
Nice! Now all that's left is
that party over there!
Kirito
403501001_4_a
Leafa
403501001_3_a
Kirito
403501001_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
We took care of all of these guys,
Kirito!
Asuna
403501001_1_a
Thanks.
Kirito
403500901_35_a
Aaah, cool.
Well, good luck with that!
Philia
403500901_34_a
I was going to join up with
Asuna and some of the others.
Kirito
403500901_33_a
You form a party regardless
of race, and then fight in this
free-for-all-type thing.
Kirito
403500901_32_a
Oh yeah? What kind of quest?
Philia
403500901_31_a
Well, at least now I can focus on
getting ready for this quest
I need to do later...
Kirito
403500901_30_a
Yeah!
Philia
403500901_29_a
Thank you, Philia!
It's a date!
Strea
403500901_28_a
Hehe.
Besides, it sounds kind of fun.
Philia
403500901_27_a
Aw, come on! Give me a little more
credit than that...
Kirito
403500901_26_a
You hovering over her like some
creepy manager would totally
kill the whole mood of the event.
Philia
403500901_25_a
Yeah. It's probably better if I
go instead of you.
Philia
403500901_24_a
What? Are you sure?
Kirito
403500901_23_a
If you're that worried, I'll go
with her.
Philia
403500901_22_a
You're kind of missing the point...
Kirito
403500901_21_a
I won't let that happen! I belong
to Kirito, after all!
Strea
403500901_20_a
You mean...
Like, glomping me or something?
Strea
403500901_19_a
You know how crazy fans can get.
Sometimes they cross the line.
I bet that's why he's worried.
Philia
403500901_18_a
Everyone who joins that guild
joins because they like you,
right?
Philia
403500901_17_a
Ph-Philia, don't...
Kirito
403500901_16_a
What are you
talking about, Philia?
Strea
403500901_15_a
Strea
403500901_14_a
Kirito
403500901_13_a
Heheh! He's probably worried about
you going to that event.
Philia
403500901_12_a
Nothing...
Kirito
403500901_11_a
What is it, Kirito?
Strea
403500901_10_a
I-I see...
Kirito
403500901_9_a
and they've asked me to make an
appearance as their special guest!
Strea
403500901_8_a
They're even putting on an event,
Strea
403500901_7_a
and before I knew it, someone
had started a guild!
Strea
403500901_6_a
Hahaha! People kept asking, so I
kept uploading more and more
photos of my sailor uniform,
Strea
403500901_5_a
Wh-When did this guild show up?!
Kirito
403500901_4_a
Yeeep!
Strea
403500901_3_a
Strea
403500901_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Huh? What is this?
The Sailor Strea Fanclub?!
Kirito
403500901_1_a
Kirito
403500801_45_a
Hehe, yay!
Yui
403500801_44_a
Philia
403500801_43_a
Yaaay! I got another response!
This one says, "Super cute"!
Strea
403500801_42_a
Yui
403500801_41_a
I hope you're right...
Kirito
403500801_40_a
Strea
403500801_39_a
It's Strea, after all. No way
anyone would dare insult her!
Philia
403500801_38_a
Strea
403500801_37_a
Hehe, nothing.
I'm sure it'll all work out.
Philia
403500801_36_a
Yui
403500801_35_a
Huh?
Kirito
403500801_34_a
Strea
403500801_33_a
I'm kind of jealous, actually...
Philia
403500801_32_a
Yui
403500801_31_a
I-I don't mean to be...
Kirito
403500801_30_a
You're such a dad! Worrying about
every little thing when it comes
to your kids.
Philia
403500801_29_a
Strea
403500801_28_a
So that's what's got
you worried...
Philia
403500801_27_a
Yui
403500801_26_a
I just don't want it to cause
her any trouble, you know?
Kirito
403500801_25_a
Yui
403500801_24_a
Yeah. That sailor uniform of
Strea's is really great, but...
Kirito
403500801_23_a
Strea
403500801_22_a
Ugh, yeah. Trolls.
Philia
403500801_21_a
Yui
403500801_20_a
but popular posts get seen by lots
of people. There's always at least
one jerk who has to be mean.
Kirito
403500801_19_a
Yui
403500801_18_a
Well, you can share photos and
comment and stuff in your own
personal circles,
Kirito
403500801_17_a
Strea
403500801_16_a
What do you mean?
Philia
403500801_15_a
Yui
403500801_14_a
I just can't help thinking maybe
I shouldn't have...
Kirito
403500801_13_a
Yui
403500801_12_a
Well, Strea kept asking, so I
caved and showed her how to upload
photos to social media, but...
Kirito
403500801_11_a
Something wrong, Kirito?
Philia
403500801_9_a
Strea
403500801_10_a
Yui
403500801_8_a
...
Kirito
403500801_7_a
Strea
403500801_6_a
Hehe, way to go, Strea.
Philia
403500801_5_a
Kirito
403500801_4_a
That's great, Strea!
Yui
403500801_3_a
Philia
403500801_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Yay! I keep getting
more and more "likes"!
Strea
403500801_1_a
Well...
Kirito
403500701_26_a
Like what, Daddy?
Yui
403500701_25_a
Okay, but... I don't know, I've
got some...concerns...
Kirito
403500701_24_a
Then that's what I'll do!
Kirito, show me how it works!
Strea
403500701_23_a
What? Seriously?
Strea
403500701_22_a
But then everyone in the game will
be able to see it...
Kirito
403500701_21_a
You could always take a picture
and upload it to ALO's SNS.
Kirito
403500701_20_a
I wish there was a way of showing
them all at the same time...
Strea
403500701_19_a
Yeah, everyone has been pretty
busy lately... They hardly leave
their own territory anymore.
Kirito
403500701_18_a
And Liz and Silica and everyone
else...
Strea
403500701_17_a
Awww, I wanted to show her, too...
Strea
403500701_16_a
Ah, she had some stuff to do,
so she logged out already.
Kirito
403500701_15_a
Yui
403500701_14_a
Hang on... Where IS Asuna, anyway?
Strea
403500701_13_a
I-I'm being framed!
Kirito
403500701_12_a
I'm telling Mommy!
Yui
403500701_11_a
Th-That's where I was looking!
Kirito
403500701_10_a
Kiritooo, my eyes are up here!
Strea
403500701_9_a
But isn't is a bit...small?
Kirito
403500701_8_a
It looks great on you, too!
Kirito
403500701_7_a
Thank you!
Strea
403500701_6_a
That's so cute, Strea!
Yui
403500701_5_a
Whoa, you're all finished!
Kirito
403500701_4_a
Yui
403500701_3_a
Kirito
403500701_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Ta-daaaa!
Strea
403500701_1_a
You've got some explaining to
do, Kirito.
Asuna
403500601_25_a
Gaaah!
Kirito
403500601_24_a
It was in your browser history,
Daddy.
Yui
403500601_23_a
I-I mean, I don't remember reading
any comments like that, s-so I
don't know...
Kirito
403500601_22_a
Oh reeeaaally...?
Asuna
403500601_21_a
That's all!
Kirito
403500601_20_a
C-Come on, Asuna! It was probably
just a thread about popular
outfits or equipment in the game!
Kirito
403500601_19_a
You better not be showing her
anything inappropriate...
Asuna
403500601_18_a
What exactly are you exposing
her to, Kirito?
Asuna
403500601_17_a
Wha
Kirito
403500601_16_a
I read it in the comments of a
walkthrough forum that
Daddy visits all the time!
Yui
403500601_15_a
Kirito
403500601_14_a
Uh...
Where did you hear that, Yui?
Asuna
403500601_13_a
But Mommy, I've heard boys really
love sailor uniforms, too!
Yui
403500601_12_a
Huh... Well, whatever floats their
boats, I guess.
Kirito
403500601_11_a
Sailor uniforms are just one of
those things that girls tend to
really love.
Asuna
403500601_10_a
I can't believe she was so
enamored with them...
Kirito
403500601_9_a
I think she's trying to make a
sailor uniform.
Yui
403500601_8_a
As soon as we got back to ALO, she
went straight to her room and
started sewing things.
Yui
403500601_7_a
Oh yeah? Hey,
where'd she get off to, anyway?
Kirito
403500601_6_a
Hehe! Still, it seems like Strea had
a really great time.
Yui
403500601_5_a
sigh
... I hope that's the first
and last time I break out in a
cold sweat in broad daylight!
Kirito
403500601_4_a
Yui
403500601_3_a
Kirito
403500601_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Ahahaha...
What a disaster.
Asuna
403500601_1_a
Yui
403500501_46_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Whaaat! Why are we running away
again?!
Strea
403500501_45_a
bg_os_town_2
Gah! Crap!
Time to get out of here!
Kazuto
403500501_44_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Strea
403500501_43_a
Daddy, those girls are looking at
you... They must think you're
arguing with yourself...
Yui
403500501_42_a
Kazuto
403500501_41_a
...
Student B
403500501_40_a
...
Student A
403500501_39_a
I could get in big trouble if
someone thought I was taking
skeevy photos or something!
Kazuto
403500501_38_a
bg_os_town_2
I'm already weird enough with this
probe on my shoulders!
Kazuto
403500501_37_a
Yui
403500501_36_a
bg_11_home_lounge
So just don't do anything weird,
and you'll be fine!
Strea
403500501_35_a
bg_os_town_2
B-Because reasons! I'll look like
some sort of weirdo!
Kazuto
403500501_34_a
Yui
403500501_33_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Why nooot?
Strea
403500501_32_a
bg_os_town_2
What?! N-No way!
Kazuto
403500501_31_a
Yui
403500501_30_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Kirito, don't lose sight of those
girls! I need to get a good look
at their uniforms!
Strea
403500501_29_a
bg_os_town_2
W-Well, it's probably doable...
Kazuto
403500501_28_a
Yui
403500501_27_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Yeah! I wonder if my sewing skills
are high enough for me to make
them in ALO!
Strea
403500501_26_a
bg_os_town_2
Y-You think?
Kazuto
403500501_25_a
Yui
403500501_24_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Aaah, how cute!
They're so adorable!
Strea
403500501_23_a
bg_os_town_2
Oh, um...
Those are sailor uniforms.
Kazuto
403500501_22_a
Yui
403500501_21_a
Kirito, what do you call those
clothes they had on?
Strea
403500501_20_a
Why were you looking at them,
Strea?
Yui
403500501_19_a
Strea
403500501_18_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Those girls look like middle
schoolers, or maybe even high
schoolers...
Yui
403500501_17_a
Kazuto
403500501_16_a
You're hopeless...
Student B
403500501_15_a
So you just put them back on
during study hall?
Student B
403500501_14_a
Yeah, totally! 'Cause my teacher
found out I had fake nails on...
Student A
403500501_13_a
bg_os_town_2
Hm?
Kazuto
403500501_12_a
Strea
403500501_11_a
What is it, Strea?
Yui
403500501_10_a
Yui
403500501_9_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Huh...?
Strea
403500501_8_a
bg_os_town_2
S-Sure.
Kazuto
403500501_7_a
Yui
403500501_6_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Fine... Promise?
Strea
403500501_5_a
bg_os_town_2
I told you I was sorry! Listen,
we'll bring Asuna next time, and
she can take you. Deal?
Kazuto
403500501_4_a
Yui
403500501_3_a
bg_11_home_lounge
I can't believe you, Kirito!
You meanie!
Strea

bg_os_town_2
pant

...
Kazuto
403500501_1_a
Yui
403500401_39_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Heeeey, where are you going?!
You're running right past it!
Strea
403500401_38_a
bg_os_town_2
gulp
... I-I can't!
I'm sorry, but I just can't!
Kazuto
403500401_37_a
Yui
403500401_36_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Why? C'mooon, just get a little
closer so I can get a better look!
Strea
403500401_35_a
bg_os_town_2
I-It's not that... It's just a
really dangerous dungeon for me
to go into all by myself...
Kazuto
403500401_34_a
Strea
403500401_33_a
bg_11_home_lounge
What's wrong, Daddy? Are you not
allowed in there?
Yui
403500401_32_a
bg_os_town_2
Wh-What?!
Th-This one...?!
I-I...
Kazuto
403500401_31_a
Yui
403500401_30_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Kiritoooo!
I wanna go to that store!
Strea
403500401_29_a
bg_os_town_2
Yeah, especially for women's
fashion.
Kazuto
403500401_28_a
Strea
403500401_27_a
bg_11_home_lounge
But in the real world, it's
all about what looks good,
right?
Yui
403500401_26_a
so they're designed with defense
and other buffs or abilities in
mind.
Kazuto
403500401_25_a
bg_os_town_2
Yeah, I suppose so. For the most
part, VR clothes are all tailored
towards combat,
Kazuto
403500401_24_a
Strea
403500401_23_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Clothing in the real world is
quite different from what you
get in VR, isn't it?
Yui
403500401_22_a
bg_os_town_2
Haha...
Kazuto
403500401_21_a
Yui
403500401_20_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Whoaaaa... I've never seen
items like this before!
Strea
403500401_19_a
bg_os_town_2
There's a ton of fancy boutiques
like that around here.
Kazuto
403500401_18_a
Yui
403500401_17_a
bg_11_home_lounge
DO I?! Lead the way!
Strea
403500401_16_a
bg_os_town_1
Then there's this place that I
think you'll really like. Wanna
check it out?
Kazuto
403500401_15_a
Yui
403500401_14_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Totally!
Strea
403500401_13_a
bg_os_town_1
I know you've made items that
copy real-world fashion before,
so I take it you like that kind of stuff?
Kazuto
403500401_12_a
Yui
403500401_11_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Yep!
Strea
403500401_10_a
bg_os_town_1
Oh hey, Strea... You've gotten your
sewing skill pretty high lately,
right?
Kazuto
403500401_9_a
Strea
403500401_8_a
Hehe, I'm glad you're having
fun, Strea.
Yui
403500401_7_a
It's totally different seeing it
in person, rather than pictures
and stuff online!
Strea
403500401_6_a
The buildings, the people
it's all
totally different from SAO or ALO!
Strea
403500401_5_a
Everywhere I look there's
something new!
Strea
403500401_4_a
Yui
403500401_3_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Whoaaa! It's soooo coooool!
Strea
403500401_2_a
bg_os_town_1
What do you think, Strea?
Kazuto
403500401_1_a
Yui
403500301_47_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Ahahaha!
Strea
403500301_46_a
Suguha
403500301_45_a
H-Hey! Strea doesn't
feel it when you smack ME,
you know!
Kazuto
403500301_44_a
Kazuto
403500301_43_a
bg_15_kirigaya_home
S-Strea, you little
Suguha
403500301_42_a
Yui
403500301_41_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Of course! And just as curvaceous,
too!
Strea
403500301_40_a
Hehe! So, what do you think?
Am I as cute in this world?
Suguha
403500301_39_a
Suguha
403500301_38_a
bg_15_kirigaya_home
Geez, sorry to disappoint...
Kazuto
403500301_37_a
Yui
403500301_36_a
bg_11_home_lounge
So this is how you look in
real life! That's so cool! Unlike
Kirito, who looks exactly the same.
Strea
403500301_35_a
Kazuto
403500301_34_a
bg_15_kirigaya_home
That's awesome!
Suguha
403500301_33_a
Strea
403500301_32_a
bg_11_home_lounge
I'm here this time, too! Strea
and I are linked up so we can both
see!
Yui
403500301_31_a
Ooh, like that one time with Yui!
Suguha
403500301_30_a
Yeah. I synched this probe up
with her.
Kazuto
403500301_29_a
Kazuto
403500301_28_a
bg_15_kirigaya_home
Wha
? Who's there?!
Wait, is that Strea?
Suguha
403500301_27_a
Yui
403500301_26_a
bg_11_home_lounge
That's Leafa's voice!
Strea
403500301_25_a
Kazuto
403500301_24_a
bg_15_kirigaya_home
Hey, where're you going?
Suguha
403500301_23_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_morning
Alright then, let's get out
of here.
Kazuto
403500301_22_a
Yui
403500301_21_a
Heck yeah!
Strea
403500301_20_a
Heheh! Getting to see the real
world for the first time has put
you in a really good mood!
Yui
403500301_19_a
Yui
403500301_18_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Okaaaaay!
Strea
403500301_17_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_morning
Besides, the camera can't keep up
if you move around so fast. You'll
end up getting lag.
Kazuto
403500301_16_a
Yui
403500301_15_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Ehehehe, sooorryyyy.
Strea
403500301_14_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_morning
Hey, stop looking around like
that! This is my room, not some
weird exhibition!
Kazuto
403500301_13_a
Yui
403500301_12_a
Heh heh... Iiinteresting,
veeery interesting...
Heh heh heh...
Strea
403500301_11_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Whaaat!
No way!
Strea
403500301_9_a
Yui
403500301_10_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_morning
Ah, sorry...
This is my room.
Kazuto
403500301_8_a
Yui
403500301_7_a
But where are we? This space
seems kind of cramped...
Strea
403500301_6_a
Whoaaaaaa! The real world is
so amaaaziiiing!
Strea
403500301_5_a
Strea
403500301_4_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Yes! We can see you
crystal clear, Daddy!
Yui
403500301_3_a
How's this? Yui, Strea, can
you see?
Kazuto
403500301_2_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_morning
Alright, this should do it!
Kazuto
403500301_1_a
What's that Kirito up to...
Asuna
403500201_33_a
Strea
403500201_32_a
Kirito
403500201_31_a
...
Asuna
403500201_30_a
Gaah!
I told you, no glomping!
Kirito
403500201_29_a
Yui
403500201_28_a
Kirito
403500201_27_a
Yaaaaaay! I love you, Daddy!
Strea
403500201_26_a
Haha! Sounds like we've
got ourselves a real world
father-daughter-daughter date, then!
Kirito
403500201_25_a
Yay! Then we can go to the real
world together!
Strea
403500201_24_a
Of course I don't mind sharing with Strea!
Yui
403500201_23_a
R-Really?! That's amazing!
Yui
403500201_22_a
it should be possible
to set it up so you can both use
it at the same time.
Kirito
403500201_21_a
Well, maybe... The visuals can
only be set to one of you, but if
you don't mind sharing,
Kirito
403500201_20_a
Then that means I can't come to
the real world with you, right?
Yui
403500201_19_a
I knew you'd think of something,
Daddy! But if Strea's going to
use it...
Yui
403500201_18_a
Yui
403500201_17_a
Kirito
403500201_16_a
But I'm just so happyyyy!
Strea
403500201_15_a
Hrkk! Hey, how many times do I
have to tell you to quit glomping
me like that?!
Kirito
403500201_14_a
Yui
403500201_13_a
Kirito
403500201_12_a
Yaaaay!
You're the best, Kirito!
Strea
403500201_11_a
Yeah, but I made it myself. It's
nothing close to being finished,
so you can't just use it whenever.
Kirito
403500201_10_a
Whoaaa, really?!
Strea
403500201_9_a
Oh, that's right...!
Yui
403500201_8_a
That allows someone of the virtual
world to "go" to the real world,
in a loose sense of the word.
Kirito
403500201_7_a
Yeah. Remember the bidirectional
communication probe you used
before, Yui?
Kirito
403500201_6_a
Are you saying you can do
something about this, Kirito?
Strea
403500201_5_a
Daddy...?
Yui
403500201_4_a
Strea
403500201_3_a
Yui
403500201_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Haha, is that all?
Kirito
403500201_1_a
What?!
Kirito
403500101_27_a
Th-There's nothing I can do
to help her...!
Yui
403500101_26_a
Y-Yui? What happened?!
Is it Strea?!
Kirito
403500101_25_a
Kirito
403500101_24_a
sniff
... 
sob
...
Daaaadddyyyyy...
Yui
403500101_23_a
O-Oh...
Yui
403500101_22_a
After all, it's where Kirito and
everyone are originally from...
Strea
403500101_21_a
but that just makes me want to see it
even more!
Strea
403500101_20_a
I mean...
I know that NPCs only exist in VR
and can't go to the real world,
Strea
403500101_19_a
Huh?!
R-Really?
Yui
403500101_18_a
I really, really wanna go
to the real world...
Strea
403500101_17_a
Oh, hi Yui...
Well, the truth is...
Strea
403500101_16_a
You look kind of sad...
Yui
403500101_15_a
Strea
403500101_14_a
Hi Strea... Is something wrong?
Yui
403500101_13_a
I'll be back in a moment!
Yui
403500101_12_a
That is true.
Haha, alright, go on then.
Kirito
403500101_11_a
And I am Strea's big sister,
after all!
Yui
403500101_10_a
That's okay! I think this might be
one of those things that only
sisters can talk about.
Yui
403500101_9_a
Huh?
But I could just come with you...
Kirito
403500101_8_a
Wait here, Daddy!
Yui
403500101_7_a
You're right... I'll go talk to her.
Yui
403500101_6_a
She's been staring off into the
distance with this listless look
on her face.
Kirito
403500101_5_a
Yui
403500101_4_a
Hey, what's up with Strea?
Kirito
403500101_3_a
sigh
...
Strea
403500101_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hmmm...
Strea
403500101_1_a
Yeah, you're right!
Asuna
403301201_18_a
But for now, we should focus on
enjoying what time we have left!
Kirito
403301201_17_a
Maybe they'll keep it going.
Kirito
403301201_16_a
but if they get enough positive
feedback, who knows.
Kirito
403301201_15_a
They said it was just
an April Fool's thing,
Kirito
403301201_14_a
Leafa
403301201_13_a
True... Hopefully the company will
decide to turn this into a
permanent game.
Kirito
403301201_12_a
This is something we never, ever
would have experienced without VR.
It's just amazing!
Asuna
403301201_11_a
Yeah, especially because this kind
of pop star stuff is a total pipe
dream in the real world...
Yuuki
403301201_10_a
It's just so much fun! I wish it
would never end...
Leafa
403301201_9_a
Haha,
you guys are really into this.
Kirito
403301201_8_a
I wanted to get better at dancing
and try my hand at some really
complex choreography...
Silica
403301201_7_a
I still haven't extended my
range as high as I wanted to...
Liz
403301201_6_a
I wonder how many more shows
we'll be able to squeeze in before
time runs out...
Sinon
403301201_5_a
The game's just about finished,
isn't it?
Asuna
403301201_4_a
Sinon
403301201_3_a
Asuna
403301201_2_a
bg_event_broken_town_postwar
Alright then, let's make our way
to the next town.
Kirito
403301201_1_a
Yeah. Just us, the stage,
and our voices.
Asuna
403301101_31_a
But y'know, you won't win so
easily next time! It'll be a pure,
no-frills singing contest!
Rain
403301101_30_a
Haha, all's well that ends well,
I guess?
Kirito
403301101_29_a
Hahaha!
Seven
403301101_28_a
I'm sorry, was that honest
reflection I heard come out of
your mouth? Are you my sister?
Rain
403301101_27_a
Heh, yeah. It's just like they
say, one good turn deserves
another!
Seven
403301101_26_a
Hehe, still, I'm glad fighting
those monsters didn't backfire
on us after all.
Rain
403301101_25_a
I can't believe we lost to Asuna's
group...! How mortifying!
Seven
403301101_24_a
Y-Yeah... That's...awesome?
Kirito
403301101_23_a
Kirito
403301101_22_a
Silica
403301101_21_a
That means you got to contribute
to our show without having to sing
after all, Kirito!
Leafa
403301101_20_a
I guess this is their way of
quantifying their gratitude...
Sinon
403301101_19_a
Wow, you're right! And each
monster was one point!
Silica
403301101_18_a
Was how many monsters each group
defeated!
Liz
403301101_17_a
Look at this! One of
the categories for scoring...
Liz
403301101_16_a
But, I thought...
Asuna
403301101_15_a
Yay! We did it!
Asuna
403301101_14_a
Your group came first...
And we came second...
Rain
403301101_13_a
AHHH!
Seven
403301101_12_a
Whoa...!
Kirito
403301101_11_a
Ooh, I'm so nervous...
Silica
403301101_10_a
Hey,
they're announcing the results!
Liz
403301101_9_a
Well that sucks...
Leafa
403301101_8_a
I figured as much...
Sinon
403301101_7_a
People are saying the first group
will probably get the highest
score...
Asuna
403301101_6_a
Thanks! Now that we've all
performed, we just have to wait
and see how the NPCs vote...
Rain
403301101_5_a
Nice job, you two!
Kirito
403301101_4_a
Rain
403301101_3_a
Kirito
403301101_2_a
bg_event_idol_stage_open_space
Phew! I feel SO much better now!
How do people even live without
singing?
Seven
403301101_1_a
Oh? Well, we can't just leave a
job unfinished...
Kirito
403301001_25_a
Hey, guys, look over there! Seems
we missed a monster or two!
Leafa
403301001_24_a
There, there...
Let it all out...
Rain
403301001_23_a
I can't stand this!
I WON'T stand for this!
Seven
403301001_22_a
Ugh! How can you all just sit
there, twiddling your thumbs!
Seven
403301001_21_a
Agreed!
Silica
403301001_20_a
Not after we worked so hard with
Seven's group to get rid of those
monsters!
Asuna
403301001_19_a
No way are we skipping this town
now.
Kirito
403301001_18_a
It doesn't matter what they have.
There's nothing we can do but
wait anyway.
Kirito
403301001_17_a
So what, these NPCs all have
acute A.D.D.?
Liz
403301001_16_a
Well, think about it. You start to
lose interest the longer you watch
something, entertaining or not.
Yuuki
403301001_15_a
Who knows...
Sinon
403301001_14_a
R-Really? Why would that be?
Silica
403301001_13_a
that the NPCs end up liking groups
that perform first in their town
far better.
Sinon
403301001_12_a
I wouldn't be so sure... People
have been posting on the
message boards
Sinon
403301001_11_a
W-Well, it's nothing to get worked
up over. It's not like going first
matters in this game...
Liz
403301001_10_a
You're right.
Asuna
403301001_9_a
This kind of feels like waiting
your turn to fight an Aincrad
floor boss back in SAO...
Kirito
403301001_8_a
I hate waiting while some other
group hogs the only stage
for their pathetic "concert"!
Seven
403301001_7_a
Only because it's TRUE!
I hate this!
Seven
403301001_6_a
You've only said that about
a hundred times now...
Rain
403301001_5_a
I know, Seven, I know...
Rain
403301001_4_a
Kirito
403301001_3_a
Rain
403301001_2_a
bg_event_broken_town_near
I. Am. SO. ANGRY!
Seven
403301001_1_a
Yeah!
Kirito
403300901_27_a
Come on guys, we have to hurry!
Rain
403300901_26_a
If they think they can steal this
show out from under me, they've
got another thing coming!
Seven
403300901_25_a
Th-That's totally cheating!
Yuuki
403300901_24_a
Grrr... That figures!
Kirito
403300901_23_a
They must have been waiting for us
to beat those monsters so they
could rush in and perform!
Asuna
403300901_22_a
Silica
403300901_21_a
Crap!
Kirito
403300901_20_a
Look at all those players! They're
running straight for the town!
Sinon
403300901_19_a
What is it?
Silica
403300901_18_a
Whoa!
Sinon
403300901_17_a
Guess we better head back...
Sinon
403300901_16_a
Yeah!
Silica
403300901_15_a
As if! You're the ones who better
watch their backs!
Liz
403300901_14_a
Hehe, then that makes us rivals
once again. Be prepared to get
your butt kicked during the show!
Seven
403300901_13_a
Now we should be able to perform
in that town.
Leafa
403300901_12_a
Working together really made all
the difference. I'm glad we
teamed up.
Asuna
403300901_11_a
Fantastic job, everyone!
Seven
403300901_10_a
Yay!
Rain
403300901_9_a
Seven
403300901_8_a
Rain
403300901_7_a
Alright, that's all of them!
Kirito
403300901_6_a
Gyaaaahh!
Monster
403300901_5_a
Take THIS!
Seven
403300901_4_a
Kirito
403300901_3_a
Seven
403300901_2_a
bg_event_broken_town_near
Gotcha!
Rain
403300901_1_a
They're done for!
Seven
403300801_17_a
Those monsters don't stand a
chance now that we're united!
Kirito
403300801_16_a
Then I guess we've got ourselves
a temporary truce.
Kirito
403300801_15_a
No need to thank us for doing
the right thing!
Seven
403300801_14_a
You two are the best! Thank you!
Yuuki
403300801_13_a
We have no choice but to work
together and defeat those
monsters!
Rain
403300801_12_a
Yeah! Besides, our two groups are
the only ones who have made it
here, anyway.
Rain
403300801_11_a
That'd just leave a bad taste
in my mouth!
Seven
403300801_10_a
It's still possible to win even
if you give up and leave here
without performing, but...
Asuna
403300801_9_a
Yeah... The rules of the game
are to perform in every AREA, but
they don't say every TOWN.
Asuna
403300801_8_a
After all, no one wants to make
things easier for their rivals.
Kirito
403300801_7_a
True. That does put us in an
unfavorable position.
Kirito
403300801_6_a
any other group that comes here
will be able to perform
as usual.
Rain
403300801_5_a
But then that means once we take
down the monsters that destroyed
this town,
Rain
403300801_4_a
Kirito
403300801_3_a
Rain
403300801_2_a
bg_event_broken_town_near
I see...
So this is a unique quest.
Seven
403300801_1_a
Yeah!
Kirito
403300701_26_a
Agreed! I just know they'll
say yes!
Silica
403300701_25_a
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's ask them for their help!
Leafa
403300701_24_a
So there's no reason we shouldn't
be able to work together to fight
some monsters!
Kirito
403300701_23_a
It's definitely possible. Groups
only become rivals when they
perform up on stage...
Kirito
403300701_22_a
I bet you're right!
Asuna
403300701_21_a
Yep. I bet we could join forces
with Rain and the others to take
those monsters down!
Yuuki
403300701_20_a
Liz
403300701_19_a
Aha!
Kirito
403300701_18_a
Which means this event doesn't
trigger for each and every
party...
Kirito
403300701_17_a
Now that you mention it,
no...
Liz
403300701_16_a
When we went after those monsters,
our surroundings didn't change
into an instance map, did they?
Yuuki
403300701_15_a
What is it, Yuuki?
Asuna
403300701_14_a
Hey, guys,
something's fishy...
Yuuki
403300701_13_a
No matter how powerful Rain may
be, there's still a limit to what
she can do.
Kirito
403300701_12_a
but the other members don't seem
to be that strong...
Leafa
403300701_11_a
Yeah...
Rain is pretty dang kickass,
Leafa
403300701_10_a
Looks like Seven and Rain's group
ran from those monsters, too...
Sinon
403300701_9_a
Asuna
403300701_8_a
Sinon
403300701_7_a
Ah...
Kirito
403300701_6_a
I know...
Rain
403300701_5_a
I don't care! I want us to perform
here, just like everywhere else!
Seven
403300701_4_a
Seven... These monsters are just
too strong...
Rain
403300701_3_a
Rain
403300701_2_a
bg_event_broken_town_near
pant
...
What the heck?!
Seven
403300701_1_a
Come on, hurry!
Kirito
403300601_20_a
R-Right... We have to know our
limits.
Asuna
403300601_19_a
But I think we need to retreat
and formulate a different
strategy.
Kirito
403300601_18_a
I wanted to get rid of these
monsters so you could perform
for that town...
Kirito
403300601_17_a
Guys, I don't think we can last
much longer...
Kirito
403300601_16_a
Yeah... We should have worked more
on our battle skills, not just our
singing...!
Yuuki
403300601_15_a
He knew there'd be even stronger
enemies and harder fights ahead
of us.
Leafa
403300601_14_a
Kirito was right...
Silica
403300601_13_a
Why'd they put monsters this
strong in a game that's supposed
to be about becoming a pop star?!
Sinon
403300601_12_a
Th-They're barely feeling anything
we hit them with...!
Asuna
403300601_11_a
Gyaaggghh?!
Monster
403300601_10_a
Hyaaah!
Asuna
403300601_9_a
But these things...are way too
strong...!
Kirito
403300601_8_a
I-I'm doing all I can!
Kirito
403300601_7_a
Come on, Super-Manager,
hang in there!
Liz
403300601_6_a
Hng...!
Kirito
403300601_5_a
Asuna
403300601_4_a
Liz
403300601_3_a
Kirito
403300601_2_a
bg_event_broken_town_near
GRAAAAAGHH!!
Monster
403300601_1_a
...
Kirito
403300501_25_a
But we have to hunt down the
monsters that destroyed the
village first.
Rain
403300501_24_a
They said they need song and dance
more than ever now, to
lift their spirits...
Seven
403300501_23_a
The villagers seem to want to
hear us sing, though.
Seven
403300501_22_a
Safe to say no one's performing
here, then...
Yuuki
403300501_21_a
That's terrible...
Asuna
403300501_20_a
They said a huge horde of
monsters attacked just a little
while ago...
Seven
403300501_19_a
We found an NPC villager
and asked about the situation...
Seven
403300501_18_a
No, we just got here ourselves.
It was quite the shock...
Rain
403300501_17_a
Rain, Seven... Do you know what
happened here?
Kirito
403300501_16_a
So, you made it, too.
Seven
403300501_15_a
Kirito
403300501_14_a
Seven
403300501_13_a
Oh, it's Kirito and crew.
Rain
403300501_12_a
What could have happened...?
Leafa
403300501_11_a
Look at that smoke... This town
was destroyed recently...
Sinon
403300501_10_a
What the heck?! We can't perform
for a bunch of rubble!
Liz
403300501_9_a
The town's in ruins...
Silica
403300501_8_a
N-No way...
Asuna
403300501_7_a
Wha
Kirito
403300501_6_a
...What?!
Yuuki
403300501_5_a
I bet we're the first group to
make it this far!
Yuuki
403300501_4_a
Liz
403300501_3_a
Kirito
403300501_2_a
bg_event_broken_town
Another day, another town!
Yuuki
403300501_1_a
Ahaha, well, Rain CAN use dual
blades after all...
Asuna
403300401_49_a
Talk about double trouble...
Yuuki
403300401_48_a
Yeah... Rain can sing AND she's
got that hulked-out manager
ability...
Yuuki
403300401_47_a
Leafa
403300401_46_a
I think they've got us
beat this time...
Kirito
403300401_45_a
D-Don't be ridiculous... No way
can I sing without auto-tune,
let alone dance!
Kirito
403300401_44_a
Maybe you should come out on stage
with us too, Kirito!
Leafa
403300401_43_a
True...
Kirito
403300401_42_a
Well, it's Rain. I doubt singing
without auto-tune will be much
of an issue for her.
Silica
403300401_41_a
She can't be serious!
Kirito
403300401_40_a
I'm going to have to sing with my
own voice, so I hope you forgive
any mistakes I might make!
Rain
403300401_39_a
Hehe, anyway, since I'm their
manager, my singing isn't
tuned in any way.
Rain
403300401_38_a
Ohhh, Seven, you don't need
to tell them that!
Rain
403300401_37_a
Even though she's sooo strong,
she's actually really shy! I had
to beg her to come out on stage!
Seven
403300401_36_a
Looks like it...
Liz
403300401_35_a
So she was part of their group
from the beginning...
Asuna
403300401_34_a
but I thought it might be fun
to try getting on stage,
just this once!
Rain
403300401_33_a
I've been acting on behalf of
Seven and everyone behind the
scenes up till now,
Rain
403300401_32_a
Wha
Kirito
403300401_31_a
Privyet, everyone!
Rain
403300401_30_a
Can I tell you all a secret? The
truth is, she's not a member...
She's our manager!
Seven
403300401_29_a
But how did she join their group?
Yuuki
403300401_28_a
Rain
403300401_27_a
Seven
403300401_26_a
I knew it'd be her...
Kirito
403300401_25_a
Ooooooh!
She's cute!
Spectators
403300401_24_a
Seven
403300401_23_a
Privyet, everyone!
Rain
403300401_22_a
And here she is! My best friend
in the whole wide world, Rain!
Seven
403300401_21_a
Kirito
403300401_20_a
Asuna
403300401_19_a
That's impossible! The system
won't allow you to add new
members to your group...
Liz
403300401_18_a
A new member...?
Asuna
403300401_17_a
Liz
403300401_16_a
Asuna
403300401_15_a
What...?
Kirito
403300401_14_a
Ooooooh!
Spectators
403300401_13_a
I'd like to introduce all of you
to our newest member!
Seven
403300401_12_a
Privyeeeeeeeet!
Spectators
403300401_11_a
Privyet, everyone!
Seven
403300401_10_a
Leafa
403300401_9_a
...!
Kirito
403300401_8_a
Wait, that's...
Asuna
403300401_7_a
Another group is performing first!
Yuuki
403300401_6_a
Guys! Look at that!
Yuuki
403300401_5_a
Yay! Let's get ready for our
concert!
Leafa
403300401_4_a
Kirito
403300401_3_a
Leafa
403300401_2_a
bg_02_fountain
Finally! It's the next town!
Silica
403300401_1_a
Yeah.
Asuna
403300301_41_a
We should be careful.
Kirito
403300301_40_a
I doubt the monsters from here on
out will be any weaker.
Kirito
403300301_39_a
But if this really is some sort of
special manager ability, then I
bet we'll need it.
Kirito
403300301_38_a
Haha... I do have my work cut
out for me, don't I?
Kirito
403300301_37_a
Yeah, you won't have time for
anything else between training us
and being our human shield!
Leafa
403300301_36_a
Hehe, sounds like you're going
to have your hands full, Kirito.
Silica
403300301_35_a
Yeah. You guys can count on me.
Kirito
403300301_34_a
That's a big help! Now we don't
have to worry about fighting, not
with Super-Manager on our side!
Liz
403300301_33_a
It is pretty easy to imagine a
manager throwing himself between
a star and their rabid fans...
Sinon
403300301_32_a
Interesting...
Asuna
403300301_31_a
I suppose a manager's top priority
is protecting his performers,
after all...
Kirito
403300301_30_a
Like if you guys are in
danger, that triggers a buff that
ups my stats.
Kirito
403300301_29_a
What?!
Yuuki
403300301_28_a
I'm not sure, but I think it's my
special ability as a manger...
Kirito
403300301_27_a
How...?
Asuna
403300301_26_a
He moved way faster than I've ever
seen him move before! It was
crazy!
Leafa
403300301_25_a
And before I knew it,
they were gone...
Kirito
403300301_24_a
Not really... My stats just
suddenly spiked way up...
Kirito
403300301_23_a
All of them? By himself?!
W-Wow... That's amazing!
Silica
403300301_22_a
Oh... Um...
Kirito defeated them...
Leafa
403300301_21_a
Huh? Kirito, Leafa, what happened
to the monsters...?
Yuuki
403300301_20_a
Leafa
403300301_19_a
Yuuki
403300301_18_a
...
Kirito
403300301_17_a
Yeah...
Sinon
403300301_16_a
It's not like we have much time to
train for fighting, either, so
there's not much we can do...
Asuna
403300301_15_a
Well, singing is the point of
this game.
Asuna
403300301_14_a
Okay... but our fighting skills
have really taken a hit since
we've been so focused on singing!
Silica
403300301_13_a
Let's go help Leafa and
Kirito deal with theirs!
Liz
403300301_12_a
Phew... That's our lot taken care
of, finally!
Yuuki
403300301_11_a
Graaaggghh!
Monster
403300301_10_a
Take THIIIS!
Yuuki
403300301_9_a
but I think we might have to hone
our battle skills a little more
if we want to keep going...
Liz
403300301_8_a
You're right... We made it this
far thanks to the combat
corrections,
Liz
403300301_7_a
Is it just me, or are the monsters
between towns super tough all of
the sudden?
Asuna
403300301_6_a
Tch, these things are stubborn!
Yuuki
403300301_5_a
Liz
403300301_4_a
Asuna
403300301_3_a
Yuuki
403300301_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Grraaaaaahhh!
Monster
403300301_1_a
...?
Asuna
403300201_33_a
I feel like I'm missing
something...
Kirito
403300201_32_a
But managers just need to be
able to deal with pop stars...
Kirito
403300201_31_a
Pop stars have to have a certain
level of talent and stage
presence...
Kirito
403300201_30_a
What are you talking about?
Asuna
403300201_29_a
So I'm your "manager," right?
Do you think I'm doing
enough?
Kirito
403300201_28_a
Liz
403300201_27_a
What is it?
Asuna
403300201_26_a
Huh...?
Kirito
403300201_25_a
since I'm not getting up on stage
like you all are...
Kirito
403300201_24_a
I mean, I'm definitely nothing
like that. All I'm doing is
helping wherever I can,
Kirito
403300201_23_a
Haha... I don't think they're all
that involved...
Kirito
403300201_22_a
Right? They arrange your schedule,
and train you to sing and dance
better
all sorts of stuff!
Yuuki
403300201_21_a
Liz
403300201_20_a
It must be really tough to be a
manager in real life!
Silica
403300201_19_a
Yeaaah, I guess.
Liz
403300201_18_a
I guess we can put up with it
for a little while longer.
Sinon
403300201_17_a
Yeah, well... Still, we've gotten
this far with your "advice."
Sinon
403300201_16_a
but I guess it came off like I
was trying to control you...
Kirito
403300201_15_a
I guess I was acting pretty
overbearing... I thought I was
just giving you advice,
Kirito
403300201_14_a
Wh-What? No, I just...!
Umm...
Kirito
403300201_13_a
Yeah, this isn't the kind of
game where you can dictate our
every move!
Liz
403300201_12_a
Ahaha! Do we need to ask
permission for everything we
eat now, Kirito?
Silica
403300201_11_a
You jerk!
Leafa
403300201_10_a
Ugghh, way to ruin my good mood!
Leafa
403300201_9_a
Yeah, but you eat plenty of meat,
so I think you're set there. Try
some veggies once in a while!
Kirito
403300201_8_a
But singers need a lot of energy,
and eating meat is good for that!
Leafa
403300201_7_a
Eating meat all the time is
bad for your dancing.
Kirito
403300201_6_a
Excuse you?! Why?!
Leafa
403300201_5_a
No snacking on meat or anything
like that, okay?
Kirito
403300201_4_a
Silica
403300201_3_a
Kirito
403300201_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Maaan, I am starving!
Leafa
403300201_1_a
Yeah...
Asuna
403300101_39_a
Regardless, if Rain's taking part,
that'll have a pretty big impact
on the entire game...
Sinon
403300101_38_a
Well no, but...
I hope I'm just being paranoid...
Kirito
403300101_37_a
Can you?
Yuuki
403300101_36_a
But wait, you can't change your
party in this game once you've
created one...
Yuuki
403300101_35_a
If it's us or Seven, my money's on
her choosing Seven...
Asuna
403300101_34_a
Sh-She is...
And she is our friend, but...
Asuna
403300101_33_a
Yeah... And she's a pretty
talented singer.
Kirito
403300101_32_a
Sinon
403300101_31_a
Rain's playing, too?!
Yuuki
403300101_30_a
Rain!
Sinon
403300101_29_a
Oh!
Asuna
403300101_28_a
I mean, we also have her sister
to think about.
Kirito
403300101_27_a
What're you talking about?
Yuuki
403300101_26_a
But I think we have an even bigger
problem on our hands.
Kirito
403300101_25_a
Seven participating in this Pop
Star Online game is one thing...
Kirito
403300101_24_a
Ah... Well...
If you really want to know...
Kirito
403300101_23_a
Why do you always try to bear
every little burden all by
yourself?
Asuna
403300101_22_a
Kirito, if there's something
bugging you, spit it out.
Asuna
403300101_21_a
Ah, yeah, it's nothing...
Kirito
403300101_20_a
Something up, Kirito?
You're awfully quiet.
Yuuki
403300101_19_a
...
Kirito
403300101_18_a
but I'm glad to see their spirits
haven't been dampened by a little
healthy competition.
Sinon
403300101_17_a
Yeah... I was a little worried
about them going up against Seven,
Sinon
403300101_16_a
Kirito
403300101_15_a
Sinon
403300101_14_a
Hehe, looks like they're
having a great time.
Asuna
403300101_13_a
Oooh, totally!
Leafa
403300101_12_a
Right! So then you're all in
for a bit of karaoke tomorrow?
Liz
403300101_11_a
Well, if you put it that way!
Silica
403300101_10_a
Wouldn't that muscle memory
help your singing skills in
the real world?
Leafa
403300101_9_a
You'd still remember how it felt
to sing like that, though.
Leafa
403300101_8_a
But I guess that's thanks to the
in-game auto-tuning. Kind of makes
it less impressive...
Liz
403300101_7_a
I even hit those high notes
without my voice cracking!
Liz
403300101_6_a
Hehe, thank you!
Liz
403300101_5_a
That sounds really good, Liz!
Silica
403300101_4_a
Leafa
403300101_3_a
Silica
403300101_2_a
bg_03_forest1
La la la...
Liz
403300101_1_a
Heck yeah!
I'm gonna start practicing RIGHT
NOW!
Leafa
403201201_33_a
Darn right we will!
Asuna
403201201_32_a
but we'll show her what we're
capable of when we put our minds
to it!
Kirito
403201201_31_a
Yeah, let's not get down on
ourselves. She may be better than
us right now,
Kirito
403201201_30_a
We've just got to keep moving at
our own pace, guys.
Liz
403201201_29_a
You're right. But that was an
absolutely stunning performance...
Asuna
403201201_28_a
And like Yuuki said, the point
of all this is to have fun.
Kirito
403201201_27_a
So we might as well put our skills
to the test and make a run at
beating Seven!
Kirito
403201201_26_a
Yeah, we're only about halfway
through!
Leafa
403201201_25_a
This isn't the last stop on our
tour.
Kirito
403201201_24_a
They're both right.
Kirito
403201201_23_a
Yuuki...
Asuna
403201201_22_a
And you can't have fun if you're
constantly worrying about the
competition!
Yuuki
403201201_21_a
Sinon's right! And I don't know
about you guys, but I came here to
have a good time!
Yuuki
403201201_20_a
We've come too far to just throw
it all away now!
Sinon
403201201_19_a
We sounded like garbage when we
started! And now look at us!
Sinon
403201201_18_a
But Sinon...
Silica
403201201_17_a
Whoa, what happened to all the
energy you guys had a second ago?
Sinon
403201201_16_a
I know...
Honestly, I think we should
give up...
Silica
403201201_15_a
What are we gonna DO, guys?
We don't stand a chance against
her!
Liz
403201201_14_a
It's as if this game were made
for Seven...
Kirito
403201201_13_a
Bringing all your knowledge of
game systems to bear, in service
of improving your singing...
Kirito
403201201_12_a
She's the real deal all right.
Her whole performance was
on another level entirely...
Leafa
403201201_11_a
Probably at the expense of
everything else...
Asuna
403201201_10_a
Yeah... It looks like she raised
her singing stats through the
roof in this game.
Asuna
403201201_9_a
Leafa
403201201_8_a
Asuna
403201201_7_a
bg_event_idol_stage_open_space
Wow. That was something else.
I wouldn't expect anything less
from Seven, though.
Kirito
403201201_6_a
Spasiba!!
Seven
403201201_5_a
Thank you all SO MUCH for coming
out to the show today!
Seven
403201201_4_a
WE LOVE YOU, SEVEN!
ENCORE! ENCORE!
Spectators
403201201_3_a
Seven
403201201_2_a
bg_event_idol_stage
That was incredible!
Just amazing!
Spectators
403201201_1_a
Yeah! Good idea!
Leafa
403201101_33_a
Keep it together, guys!
We can watch and learn!
Asuna
403201101_32_a
Uh-oh...
Kirito
403201101_31_a
In fact, I'll just hold a full
concert
right here, right now!
Seven
403201101_30_a
Hehe, I really threw you guys for
a loop, didn't I? How about I sing
you a song while you recover?
Seven
403201101_29_a
And as if that weren't enough, she
was already a superstar in ALO!
Leafa
403201101_28_a
I know... We'd be lucky to give
any Pooka from ALO a run for their
money! Damn musical fairies!
Leafa
403201101_27_a
She's going to make for one heck
of an opponent.
Sinon
403201101_26_a
True, this won't be online
forever...
Asuna
403201101_25_a
Not busy enough to keep me from
a game that's only live for a
couple days! I MADE time for this!
Seven
403201101_24_a
I thought you were really busy.
You haven't played ALO in a while
now...
Kirito
403201101_23_a
let alone play an entire GAME
designed around singing?!
Seven
403201101_22_a
Did you really think I'd pass up
an opportunity to perform,
Seven
403201101_21_a
Oh, hi Seven!
I didn't know you were participating, too!
Asuna
403201101_20_a
Seven!!
Kirito
403201101_19_a
Asuna
403201101_18_a
Kirito
403201101_17_a
Privyet, everybody!
Seven
403201101_16_a
No way... Is that
Kirito
403201101_15_a
You've got MILES to go before you
become a pro!
???
403201101_14_a
Hm?
Kirito
403201101_13_a
Hehehe...
???
403201101_12_a
Haha! You're even starting to TALK
like pros!
Kirito
403201101_11_a
You're on!
Silica
403201101_10_a
Okay, okay, I will! But only if
you promise to hit every note
of your solo in the fifth song!
Liz
403201101_9_a
Just make sure you get all the
moves in the third dance number
right, Liz!
Silica
403201101_8_a
Can you blame me for just wanting
to get out there and sing?
Liz
403201101_7_a
Of course. All this
training we're doing along the way
has really pumped up my stats!
Liz
403201101_6_a
Haha, you two are certainly
energized!
Kirito
403201101_5_a
Woo! Let's put on another great
show!
Silica
403201101_4_a
Kirito
403201101_3_a
Silica
403201101_2_a
bg_05_marten_inn
Alright, everybody!
Welcome to the next town!
Liz
403201101_1_a
Sure, why not!
Yuuki
403201001_28_a
At this rate I should just leave
the boss fight up ahead to you!
Kirito
403201001_27_a
Haha, well you've definitely
earned your reputation!
Kirito
403201001_26_a
I don't care if it's a fight or
a dance-off
I'm ready for
anything!
Yuuki
403201001_25_a
Ah, I'm with you now!
Don't worry, I've got this!
Yuuki
403201001_24_a
And that means increased
competition.
Kirito
403201001_23_a
This game may be one big joke, but
its odd theme is attracting a lot
of players.
Kirito
403201001_22_a
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
Yuuki
403201001_21_a
Just don't let your guard down.
Kirito
403201001_20_a
Hehe, okay.
Yuuki
403201001_19_a
We'll always invite you when we
see something that looks fun.
I mean that.
Kirito
403201001_18_a
Heh, don't mention it. That's what
friends are for, right?
Kirito
403201001_17_a
Thanks for helping me escape from
real life for a while.
Yuuki
403201001_16_a
And I wanted to thank you here,
since I can't in the real world.
Yuuki
403201001_15_a
Yuuki...
Kirito
403201001_14_a
I'm having the time of my life.
Yuuki
403201001_13_a
I know none of this is real, but at
least I get to sing and dance
with everybody.
Yuuki
403201001_12_a
I haven't sang anything in...
in a really long time.
Yuuki
403201001_11_a
I know, but like... You know how I
am in the real world.
The state I'm in, I mean.
Yuuki
403201001_10_a
Huh? You're always invited.
There's no need to thank me.
Kirito
403201001_9_a
I just wanted to say thanks for
inviting me to play with you guys.
Yuuki
403201001_8_a
What's that?
Kirito
403201001_7_a
Hmm, okay. In that case, I've got
something to say.
Yuuki
403201001_6_a
Hm... We've still got a ways to go,
actually.
Kirito
403201001_5_a
How far is it to the next town?
Yuuki
403201001_4_a
Yeah, Yuuki? What's up?
Kirito
403201001_3_a
Kirito
403201001_2_a
bg_event_field
Hey, Kirito...
Yuuki
403201001_1_a
Hehe, that's right!
Asuna
403200901_27_a
It'd be a shame not to!
This game won't be around forever.
Kirito
403200901_26_a
Haha, I'm glad you're all enjoying
this so much.
Kirito
403200901_25_a
Yeah! One concert down, and a
bunch more to go! Let's keep it
up!
Silica
403200901_24_a
Heh, don't look now, guys, but
I think we're starting to act
like a true pop group!
Liz
403200901_23_a
Like, duh!
Leafa
403200901_22_a
Do you have to ask?
Of COURSE it's okay, Sinonon!
Asuna
403200901_21_a
I think I want to see this through
after all. Is that okay?
Sinon
403200901_20_a
I'm sorry I tried to quit on you
all earlier...
Sinon
403200901_19_a
Nice!
Kirito
403200901_18_a
Yeah. I'm finding that any game
can be fun so long as your hard
work pays off in the end.
Sinon
403200901_17_a
Sinon? Everything okay?
Kirito
403200901_16_a
...
Sinon
403200901_15_a
Yeah, that felt good. I still see
room for improvement here and
there, but that was MUCH better.
Asuna
403200901_14_a
I haven't felt like that since
I dueled Kirito and Eugene!
Oh man, I'm high on LIFE!
Yuuki
403200901_13_a
Yeah, I even got this HUGE rush
there in the middle! My heart
was leaping out of my chest!
Yuuki
403200901_12_a
Whew! It was touch-and-go there
for a minute, but we pulled
it off!
Liz
403200901_11_a
and your stage presence and
dancing has really improved!
Kirito
403200901_10_a
None of your voices got garbled,
Kirito
403200901_9_a
Leafa
403200901_8_a
Asuna
403200901_7_a
That was INCREDIBLE, you guys!
Kirito
403200901_6_a
Oh my gosh!
Leafa
403200901_5_a
Wow!
Silica
403200901_4_a
Leafa
403200901_3_a
Silica
403200901_2_a
bg_event_idol_stage_open_space
Oh, Kirito!
Asuna
403200901_1_a
Yeah, I know.
That's your job now, heh.
Sinon
403200801_22_a
As your manager, of course.
Kirito
403200801_21_a
I'll be out there in the crowd,
watching.
Kirito
403200801_20_a
Right. Well, I can't say we're
ready for ANYTHING, but we've done
what we can
now it's showtime.
Kirito
403200801_19_a
Now all that's left is to see if
our hard work paid off.
Sinon
403200801_18_a
That's great!
Kirito
403200801_17_a
And I have to admit...
That part was pretty fun.
Sinon
403200801_16_a
I mean, it was basically like
leveling up before a big challenge
in any other game.
Sinon
403200801_15_a
but at least we prepared for this
one, I guess.
Sinon
403200801_14_a
Well, I'm still not into the
whole singing thing,
Sinon
403200801_13_a
How're you feeling, Sinon?
Kirito
403200801_12_a
...
Sinon
403200801_11_a
Haha, I know. We can't gain weight
in VR, but we still have to take
care of ourselves. It's strange.
Asuna
403200801_10_a
Trying to eat right is wearing me
out more than the practice itself!
Leafa
403200801_9_a
What Liz said...
Silica
403200801_8_a
Which is weird, considering that
VRMMOs don't tax our physical
bodies at all...
Liz
403200801_7_a
Ugh... I'm feeling a little tired
all of the sudden...
Liz
403200801_6_a
Well, we've done our best to make
it this far.
Kirito
403200801_5_a
Time for our second show.
I wonder how it'll go...
Yuuki
403200801_4_a
Kirito
403200801_3_a
Liz
403200801_2_a
bg_02_fountain
Well, this looks like the next
town.
Asuna
403200801_1_a
For Kirito, games ARE all
business...
Liz
403200701_21_a
Haha, wow. Suddenly, you're all
business!
Silica
403200701_20_a
These go into effect immediately.
Kirito
403200701_19_a
I've been crunching the numbers,
and I came up with schedules
for all of you.
Kirito
403200701_18_a
Not to mention we'll have to keep
each other fit and healthy, since
that affects your singing, too.
Kirito
403200701_17_a
That's the long way of explaining
it, yeah.
Leafa
403200701_16_a
Just like the system assist that's
in place for sword skills?
Asuna
403200701_15_a
If we boost that with dance
lessons, you'll eventually dance
automatically during concerts.
Kirito
403200701_14_a
Don't sweat it, Sinon.
There's a dancing stat, too.
Kirito
403200701_13_a
No. Absolutely not!
Sinon
403200701_12_a
Bingo! These concerts are all
about dancing, too.
Leafa
403200701_11_a
Ooh! You mean dancing, don't you!
Yuuki
403200701_10_a
Wait, in what universe is singing
NOT performing?
Sinon
403200701_9_a
But it doesn't stop there. Your
performance also factors into
audience appreciation.
Kirito
403200701_8_a
Not just that. You'll have to do
breathing exercises, and learn
how to open your throats properly.
Kirito
403200701_7_a
So we'll have to rehearse, right?
Asuna
403200701_6_a
Well, that's pretty
straightforward!
Asuna
403200701_5_a
Voice training, huh?
Silica
403200701_4_a
Sinon
403200701_3_a
Asuna
403200701_2_a
bg_11_road_to_coral
Okay, so the first step to raising
your singing stats is voice
training!
Kirito
403200701_1_a
Thank you!
Kirito
403200601_36_a
It's not like I was trying to
start drama or anything. I'll give
it one more shot.
Sinon
403200601_35_a
Why so surprised? Turning down an
offer like that would just be
mean.
Sinon
403200601_34_a
Yay, Sinonon!
Asuna
403200601_33_a
...Fine.
Sinon
403200601_32_a
Will you stick with me until then?
Kirito
403200601_31_a
Just try performing one more time.
If you're still not feeling it
after that, you can log out.
Kirito
403200601_30_a
But that also means it's my job
to keep you all motivated.
Kirito
403200601_29_a
Well, yes...
Asuna
403200601_28_a
I need to train you until you
all become superstars.
Kirito
403200601_27_a
It was right there all along.
I'm the manager who's supposed
to guide you through your careers.
Kirito
403200601_26_a
Now that I know how to raise your
singing stats, it occurred to me
what my part is in all this.
Kirito
403200601_25_a
...
Sinon
403200601_24_a
But just perform in two more
no,
one more concert with us.
Kirito
403200601_23_a
I know what you're trying to say,
and I can't force you to stick
with us.
Kirito
403200601_22_a
Uh... Why?
Sinon
403200601_21_a
Wait a second.
Kirito
403200601_20_a
Thanks, guys. I'll see you later,
then...
Sinon
403200601_19_a
Yeah. I'm sad you're leaving,
but I understand.
Silica
403200601_18_a
That's okay. You can't just tell
people to be pop stars and expect
everyone to be cool with it.
Liz
403200601_17_a
I decided to check this out with
all of you because it's a special
event. But it's just not my thing.
Sinon
403200601_16_a
Honestly?
Sinon
403200601_15_a
You're not on board, Sinon?
Kirito
403200601_14_a
...
Sinon
403200601_13_a
Me too. I'd love to stop sounding
like some sort of earthquake.
Asuna
403200601_12_a
Ooh! Then I want to level up as
fast as possible!
Silica
403200601_11_a
It makes your voice more powerful,
and adds effects like vibrato
and pitch correction.
Leafa
403200601_10_a
Based on what we've read, it
becomes a form of auto-tune that
actually helps you.
Leafa
403200601_9_a
And raising those stats will get
rid of this awful, so-called
"auto-tune," right?
Liz
403200601_8_a
Yep. Leafa and I have been
researching ways to raise
everyone's singing stats.
Kirito
403200601_7_a
Lessons, huh?
Asuna
403200601_6_a
I want to set up a schedule for
singing lessons as we head to the
next town.
Kirito
403200601_5_a
What's up?
Asuna
403200601_4_a
Liz
403200601_3_a
Asuna
403200601_2_a
bg_event_field
Gather 'round, guys.
Kirito
403200601_1_a
...
Sinon
403200501_24_a
Auto-tune or no, you can't sing
unless you open your mouth.
Kirito
403200501_23_a
I know how you feel, but this is
just how the game is played.
You have to sing.
Kirito
403200501_22_a
Aw, Sinonon...
Asuna
403200501_21_a
And even if I could, I wouldn't
know any of the popular songs.
Sinon
403200501_20_a
I've got a job on top of my school
work, so I can't get out to
karaoke.
Sinon
403200501_19_a
Come on, I'm not even good at
singing in the REAL world.
Sinon
403200501_18_a
You can't get anything past
your manager, you know.
Kirito
403200501_17_a
I was hoping you wouldn't
notice...
Sinon
403200501_16_a
Sinon... You weren't singing up
there, were you?
Kirito
403200501_15_a
What's that?
Asuna
403200501_14_a
But there's something else we have
to take care of first.
Kirito
403200501_13_a
I think I've found a way for you
to improve your singing stats.
Kirito
403200501_12_a
But they were pretty harsh...
Asuna
403200501_11_a
I think that's to be expected in
a VRMMO that's based on performing
concerts...
Asuna
403200501_10_a
Well, yeah, but...!
Leafa
403200501_9_a
That didn't stop them from booing.
Sinon
403200501_8_a
Don't worry about it, Silica.
That was just a crowd of NPCs!
Leafa
403200501_7_a
We sounded terrible! I'm so
embarrassed! I never want to sing
on stage again...
Silica
403200501_6_a
It's not your fault. Everyone's
singing stats are still really
low.
Kirito
403200501_5_a
So, uh... That was a disaster.
Yuuki
403200501_4_a
Kirito
403200501_3_a
Yuuki
403200501_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
Whew...
Liz
403200501_1_a
The auto-tune must be knocking her
off-key based on her stats...
Kirito
403200401_22_a
My voice... It's just turning into
noise!
Asuna
403200401_21_a
Wha
Asuna
403200401_20_a
What the heck is that?! It sounds
like a construction site!
Sinon
403200401_19_a
Holy crap!
What the hell is going on?
Liz
403200401_18_a
GUGUGUH! 
SKREEEEE
Asuna
403200401_17_a
Ahh... Ah? What the
GUGUGUGUGUGUGUH!!
Asuna
403200401_16_a
You sound incredible, Asuna!
Leafa
403200401_15_a
Whoa...
Kirito
403200401_14_a
Ahh, ahhh...
ahem
Laaa, la la la laaa...!
Asuna
403200401_13_a
Okay, okay, let's focus.
I'll start...
Asuna
403200401_12_a
Geez... How has it come to this?
Sinon
403200401_11_a
I can't even remember the last
time I actually sang...
Yuuki
403200401_10_a
Yeah, that's a good idea...
I mean, I don't want to know how
terrible I sound, but...
Silica
403200401_9_a
It'd also give us the chance to
see how much that auto-tune
affects us.
Liz
403200401_8_a
It looks like we can pick just
about any song we want, like
we're at karaoke.
Liz
403200401_7_a
Hey, guys... Shouldn't we maybe
rehearse once before we make
fools of ourselves on stage?
Liz
403200401_6_a
Urg, I'm getting so nervous!
Leafa
403200401_5_a
And that means our first show,
doesn't it...
Asuna
403200401_4_a
Leafa
403200401_3_a
Asuna
403200401_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
Okay, everyone. This is the first
town!
Kirito
403200401_1_a
Ah... Yeah, I'll buy that.
Sinon
403200301_26_a
I'd say he's upset that he's being
shut out of the game's core
component.
Asuna
403200301_25_a
Haha! If I had to guess...
Asuna
403200301_24_a
I'll switch with you if you really
want to sing on stage that badly!
Sinon
403200301_23_a
What are you so sad about?
Leafa
403200301_22_a
sigh
...
Kirito
403200301_21_a
So I'll just be standing on the
sidelines, watching you all
perform.
Kirito
403200301_20_a
In fact, all I can do is fight.
Kirito
403200301_19_a
That's not fair!
Silica
403200301_18_a
Nope. Managers don't get any
singing stats.
Kirito
403200301_17_a
Wait, you said "we" and "our,"
so does that mean your stats
start at zero, too?
Sinon
403200301_16_a
Nooooo!
Please tell me you're joking!
Liz
403200301_15_a
Just like everyone else's.
It's a level playing field.
Kirito
403200301_14_a
Exactly. And we've all imported
our avatars, but our singing
stats start at zero.
Kirito
403200301_13_a
That's what you're saying, right?
Yuuki
403200301_12_a
So even people who can really belt
it in real life might get stuck
with low stats in-game.
Yuuki
403200301_11_a
Those stat values affect how
you'll sound when you start
singing.
Kirito
403200301_10_a
Uhh... Yeah! I found mine.
Leafa
403200301_9_a
Seems so. You all have a bunch of
singing stats, right? Like volume
and range?
Kirito
403200301_8_a
Oh yeah?
Asuna
403200301_7_a
About that. The game seems to have
built-in auto-tune.
Kirito
403200301_6_a
and now they want us to sing
up on STAGE?!
Liz
403200301_5_a
Man, what're we gonna do? Most of
us have only ever sung in music
class or at karaoke,
Liz
403200301_4_a
Asuna
403200301_3_a
Liz
403200301_2_a
bg_event_field
So uh, yeah...
Singing fundamentals...
Kirito
403200301_1_a
You got it, boss!
Leafa
403200201_24_a
C'mon, we can talk things over
while we walk.
Kirito
403200201_23_a
and I've heard that a lot of new
players are checking it out.
Kirito
403200201_22_a
Asuna's right. This April Fools'
Day event is attracting a lot of
attention,
Kirito
403200201_21_a
Don't be! We're all in the same
boat, Silica.
Asuna
403200201_20_a
I-I'm really nervous about having
to sing on stage...
Silica
403200201_19_a
It's the uh, whaddya call 'em...
Oh yeah, the basics of singing.
Those'll be a problem.
Liz
403200201_18_a
Hehe, yeah!
Liz
403200201_17_a
Ha ha, you can say that again!
Battles we can handle, since
we all imported our avatars.
Yuuki
403200201_16_a
That's the part I'm LEAST worried
about, to be honest.
Sinon
403200201_15_a
It looks like monsters will appear
along the way, so we'll have to
be ready for combat.
Kirito
403200201_14_a
Then we'd better make our group
and get moving so we can put on
some shows.
Kirito
403200201_13_a
That's not gonna be easy...
Yuuki
403200201_12_a
Yup. We have to walk everywhere.
Kirito
403200201_11_a
Does that mean we have to
Silica
403200201_10_a
Yeah! We can't fly, like in ALO.
Leafa
403200201_9_a
Except for the part where there
aren't any cars or planes!
How're we supposed to get around?
Liz
403200201_8_a
So it's pretty much like going on
tour as a singer in the real
world.
Kirito
403200201_7_a
We then put on a show in each town
we visit, in an attempt to become
the most popular group.
Kirito
403200201_6_a
So it looks like players form
pop groups and set out on a
world tour.
Kirito
403200201_5_a
Okay then, go ahead.
Asuna
403200201_4_a
Liz
403200201_3_a
Asuna
403200201_2_a
bg_event_field
So I'll, uh...explain the rules
for this game, I guess. At least,
as far as I understand them...
Kirito
403200201_1_a
Say what?!
Asuna
403200101_41_a
The Manager...
Kirito
403200101_40_a
It says I'm...
Kirito
403200101_39_a
Okay, so we're all some type of
star. What does that make you,
Kirito?
Asuna
403200101_38_a
I guess we'll find out, won't we?
Liz
403200101_37_a
I'm a..."Child Star"!
I wonder what that means in-game?
Silica
403200101_36_a
Apparently I'm a "Pop Icon."
Yuuki
403200101_35_a
Ooh! I'm a..."Celebrity Guest"?!
So I just make guest appearances
on TV?! That's so dumb!
Liz
403200101_34_a
Looks like I'm a
"Singer-Songwriter."
Sinon
403200101_33_a
What the heck?! It says I'm a
"Gravure Idol"! Ugh, how'd I get
stuck with that?!
Leafa
403200101_32_a
That makes me sound...old,
somehow.
Asuna
403200101_31_a
It says I'm a "Diva" type...
Asuna
403200101_30_a
That's not a bad idea, actually.
I should check mine, too.
Liz
403200101_29_a
Are you checking your stats?
Leafa
403200101_28_a
Never mind, I'll figure it out
myself!
Kirito
403200101_27_a
Ouch... Fine, point taken.
So what's the point of this getup?
Kirito
403200101_26_a
Yeah, you don't really have the
right personality for it...
Yuuki
403200101_25_a
Bahahaha! Sorry, I just tried to
picture you up on stage singing
and dancing. It'd never work!
Liz
403200101_24_a
So why don't I get a fancy outfit?
Kirito
403200101_23_a
It is what they call idols outside
Japan, after all. And that would
explain the costumes!
Asuna
403200101_22_a
Maybe "Pop Star" is a more
marketable term outside Japan?
Asuna
403200101_21_a
Except it's called Pop Star
Online. What's the difference?
Silica
403200101_20_a
Woo! So we're basically playing
Idols Online!
Leafa
403200101_19_a
It looks like you've all been
turned into different types of pop
idols.
Kirito
403200101_18_a
And more importantly, what the
heck is up with these outfits?
Sinon
403200101_17_a
Well, time's of the essence with
an event like this, right? Who in
their right mind would wait?!
Yuuki
403200101_16_a
Haha, I KNEW you'd all be here as
soon as it went live!
Leafa
403200101_15_a
Um, wait... It just hit midnight,
didn't it. Are you having a good
night?
Silica
403200101_14_a
Ooh, Kirito! Asuna! Hey!
Are you guys having a good day?
Silica
403200101_13_a
Oh come on, Liz!
Asuna
403200101_12_a
AUGH, can we just have, like, five
seconds in a new game without you
slobbering all over each other?
Liz
403200101_9_a
Kirito
403200101_11_a
Asuna
403200101_10_a
Y-Yeah, I...
It looks incredible on you!
Kirito
403200101_8_a
Hehe, it sure is! What do you
think of this outfit? Cute, right?
Asuna
403200101_7_a
Whoa! Asuna, is that you?
Kirito
403200101_6_a
Kirito
403200101_5_a
Hey, Kirito.
Asuna
403200101_4_a
Pop Star Online, huh?
Kirito
403200101_3_a
They've used The Seed to make
an entirely new VRMMO just for
April Fools' Day.
Kirito
403200101_2_a
bg_event_field
Wow...
Kirito
403200101_1_a
Hehe, okay.
Asuna
403101201_22_a
Well, he is always there for us,
so let's go along with it,
just this once.
Kirito
403101201_21_a
sigh
It's just like him to
get carried away...
Sinon
403101201_20_a
Alright then, let's keep this ball
rolling and do another quest!
Come on, follow me!
Klein
403101201_19_a
Hmph... So that's it. You guys
finally realized just how
awesome I really am!
Klein
403101201_18_a
I guess I can see why you'd
feel that way.
Asuna
403101201_17_a
and having to wait so long
to be able to do something...
Asuna
403101201_16_a
It must have been hard for you,
being so excited for this event
Asuna
403101201_15_a
Ha ha, don't be weird about it.
Just take the compliment!
Kirito
403101201_14_a
Hahaha, we'd never do that!
Asuna
403101201_13_a
Y-You're just trying to butter
me up or trick me or something...
Klein
403101201_12_a
I-I told you, it was nothing...
Klein
403101201_11_a
Just like Momotaro!
Silica
403101201_10_a
Sinon's right! You took charge
and led us and our new friends
to victory!
Silica
403101201_9_a
Don't be so modest. We could never
have beat them without you.
Sinon
403101201_8_a
C-Come on, man,
it was nothing special...
Klein
403101201_7_a
All thanks to you, Klein.
You were awesome.
Kirito
403101201_6_a
bg_event_north_sea_light
We did it!
Those ogres are dust!
Klein
403101201_5_a
Sinon
403101201_4_a
Kirito
403101201_3_a
Klein
403101201_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
Hnngghaaaaaaa!
Ogre
403101201_1_a
Ha ha, yeah. Alright...
Let's follow Klein!
Kirito
403101101_29_a
Hehe, they seem even more fired
up than before.
Asuna
403101101_28_a
Tweeet tweeet!
Bird
403101101_27_a
Ugiii!
Monkey
403101101_26_a
Rraff!
Dog
403101101_25_a
Say your prayers, ogre scum!
You three, with me!
Klein
403101101_24_a
That's all the proof we needed...
Now we know we can win!
Asuna
403101101_23_a
Hehe, that sure changed your tone.
Not so high and mighty now, huh?
Klein
403101101_22_a
Impossible... It's been lost and
rotting for centuries!
Ogre
403101101_21_a
Th-That accursed blade...!
Ogre
403101101_20_a
item_event_oni_blade
Feast your eyes on this!
Klein
403101101_19_a
Yeah, but this time, we've got
everything we need. You're
going down!
Kirito
403101101_18_a
Kirito
403101101_17_a
Klein
403101101_16_a
Sinon
403101101_15_a
bg_event_north_sea
You dare show your faces here
again?!
Ogre
403101101_14_a
Yeah!
Asuna
403101101_13_a
We'll stay back so you can slice
and dice with the Onikiri until
the last ogre falls!
Kirito
403101101_12_a
Alright, Klein, you and the three
animals take point. We'll help you
out as best we can.
Kirito
403101101_11_a
Ha ha, yeah. Now there's nothing
to hold Klein back from his
true potential.
Kirito
403101101_10_a
Hahaha, it has been quite the
journey getting to this point,
hasn't it?
Asuna
403101101_9_a
I won't let you down this time!
Finally... Finally, it's my time
to shine!
Klein
403101101_8_a
We should be able to fight them
now that we have this!
Kirito
403101101_7_a
And look! It says it even comes
with a special attack to use
against ogres!
Klein
403101101_6_a
It's called...Sanmato Onikiri.
I can tell just by looking at it
that it's awesome!
Klein
403101101_5_a
Whoa...
Kirito
403101101_4_a
Klein
403101101_3_a
Kirito
403101101_2_a
item_event_oni_blade
bg_07_lisbeth_smith_work
It's finished!
Liz
403101101_1_a
Heh, you're in good hands.
Liz
403101001_24_a
We're counting on you, Liz!
Kirito
403101001_23_a
Hehe, so there's still hope!
Klein
403101001_22_a
That's great, thank you!
Kirito
403101001_21_a
Kirito
403101001_20_a
Klein
403101001_19_a
Sinon
403101001_18_a
bg_07_lisbeth_smith_work
Yeah, I can definitely do
something with this.
Liz
403101001_17_a
Alright, let's go find Liz!
Kirito
403101001_16_a
Yeah, if there was a special event
set up so we would find this, no
way would it be totally useless.
Sinon
403101001_15_a
Oh! I bet Liz could help!
Silica
403101001_14_a
Then we need a blacksmith!
Klein
403101001_13_a
You're right. It's possible we
could get this katana reforged.
Kirito
403101001_12_a
But we can't give up yet.
Asuna
403101001_11_a
I really thought we were going to
find something that would help
us defeat them...
Asuna
403101001_10_a
Seriously...
Kirito
403101001_9_a
You gotta be kidding! That won't
cut bread, let alone a demon
horde!
Klein
403101001_8_a
What the heck?
It's totally rusted...
Sinon
403101001_7_a
It's a katana, but...
Silica
403101001_6_a
item_event_oni_blade_rust
Um... Well...
Asuna
403101001_5_a
Did you find something?!
Klein
403101001_4_a
Asuna
403101001_3_a
Klein
403101001_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
Hey...!
Kirito
403101001_1_a
Could be! Let's dig it up!
Kirito
403100901_26_a
Then maybe there's an item or
something buried here that will
help us defeat them!
Klein
403100901_25_a
but now that we've fought the
ogres once, we can!
Kirito
403100901_24_a
Maybe we weren't supposed to be
able to tame the dog before,
Kirito
403100901_23_a
You know, we didn't do a quest
when we tamed the wolf...
Kirito
403100901_22_a
Maybe it's the Envious Neighbor?
Sinon
403100901_21_a
This must be another folktale!
Silica
403100901_20_a
It's like it's trying to tell us
to dig there...
Asuna
403100901_19_a
Why is it pawing at those tree
roots like that?
Kirito
403100901_18_a
Rrraaf!
Dog
403100901_17_a
A dog?
What's the matter?
Silica
403100901_16_a
Rrraaf!
Dog
403100901_15_a
Yeah... I wonder what's
going on...
Asuna
403100901_14_a
But why...? Katanas are supposed
to be extra strong against ogres!
Klein
403100901_13_a
It's not your fault. No one would
be able to deal any damage to the
ogres with that katana.
Kirito
403100901_12_a
I-I'm sorry... My katana was
totally useless...
Klein
403100901_11_a
Yeah.
Klein...?
Kirito
403100901_10_a
Not having the right info didn't
help either...
Asuna
403100901_9_a
We really are no match for those
ogres...
Silica
403100901_8_a
Y-Yeah... Our new friends fought
so hard for us too...
Silica
403100901_7_a
Those ogres are way stronger than
the info said...
Sinon
403100901_6_a
At least we were able to escape
before they killed us...
Asuna
403100901_5_a
W-We lost...
Klein
403100901_4_a
Asuna
403100901_3_a
Klein
403100901_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
Tch...!
Kirito
403100901_1_a
Yeah!
Kirito
403100801_22_a
You won't get away with this!
Come on, guys!
Klein
403100801_21_a
It matters not... You stand no
chance against us...
Ogre
403100801_20_a
Then that means...
That evil crone was your doing!
Klein
403100801_19_a
O-Ogres!
Asuna
403100801_18_a
That woman should have had enough
evil power within her to prevent
you from coming this far...
???
403100801_17_a
Wh-What...!
Kirito
403100801_16_a
You fools...
???
403100801_15_a
Are you ogres ready to eat some
cold, hard steel?!
Klein
403100801_14_a
It's finally my turn to strut my
stuff!
Klein
403100801_13_a
That's the spirit! Time to take
Onigashima down!
Klein
403100801_12_a
The three of them look like
they're ready for an adventure.
Kirito
403100801_11_a
Tweeet tweeet!
Bird
403100801_10_a
Ugiii!
Monkey
403100801_9_a
Hehe, she's a good girl!
Sinon
403100801_8_a
Ahahaha, it didn't take long for
this fearsome wolf to start acting
like a cuddly puppy...
Asuna
403100801_7_a
Rrraaf!
Wolf
403100801_6_a
Chiiirp!
Pina
403100801_5_a
Thanks for coming, Silica.
Kirito
403100801_4_a
Asuna
403100801_3_a
Klein
403100801_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
Hi everyone, I'm back!
Sorry it took so long!
Silica
403100801_1_a
Y-Yeah, you're right! Just stay
back and let me cut those ogres
down to size!
Klein
403100701_41_a
That's where you're going to steal
the show, Klein!
Kirito
403100701_40_a
I guess. But now we can finally
go to Onigashima.
Kirito
403100701_39_a
Kirito did deal the final blow in
that battle, so that must be why
the bird went to him.
Asuna
403100701_38_a
Ha ha, oh Klein, you just can't
catch a break...
Asuna
403100701_37_a
And the last one went
to Kirito...
Klein
403100701_36_a
Now we've got all three of the
animals we need.
Sinon
403100701_35_a
Tweeet!
Bird
403100701_34_a
Of course, we'd be happy to.
Kirito
403100701_33_a
I can't blame you if you hate me,
little bird. Might I ask you all
to take care of it?
NPC Grandma
403100701_32_a
You tamed it?
Sinon
403100701_31_a
Or maybe...
Kirito
403100701_30_a
Well, it must be scared of her,
considering she did try to
kill it.
Asuna
403100701_29_a
Huh? Why are you hiding behind me?
Kirito
403100701_28_a
Tweeeet tweeeet...
Bird
403100701_27_a
I am so sorry...
Well, I'm going home now...
NPC Grandma
403100701_26_a
I'm not sure...
Asuna
403100701_25_a
Huh? You think someone's pulling
the strings from somewhere?
Sinon
403100701_24_a
I'm glad we got the happy ending.
Maybe someone turned her into an
evil crone...
Asuna
403100701_23_a
Phew, what a relief.
Klein
403100701_22_a
She's back to normal now that
we defeated her.
Kirito
403100701_21_a
Whenever my husband wasn't
around, I got this strange urge
to kill it...
NPC Grandma
403100701_20_a
Kirito
403100701_19_a
Klein
403100701_18_a
Sinon
403100701_17_a
I started hating this bird before
I knew what was happening...
NPC Grandma
403100701_16_a
R-Right, on it!
Kirito
403100701_15_a
Yeah, something like that. Anyway,
we have to save that bird!
Asuna
403100701_14_a
Um, yeah, the evil crone
or something, right?
Kirito
403100701_13_a
She's gotta be the villain from
that folktale!
Klein
403100701_12_a
It's the old woman!
Kirito
403100701_11_a
I'll stick you on a spit and
roast you for dinner!
???
403100701_10_a
And the one chasing it is...!
Sinon
403100701_9_a
Running? That must mean it's not
fully healed yet, so it can't fly!
Asuna
403100701_8_a
That's the bird running
out in front!
Klein
403100701_7_a
Look over there!
Kirito
403100701_6_a
Tweeeet!
???
403100701_5_a
Asuna
403100701_4_a
Klein
403100701_3_a
Kirito
403100701_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
You little good-for-nothing!
???
403100701_1_a
Okay.
Asuna
403100601_27_a
Yeah. We should take a look
around the house next door.
Sinon
403100601_26_a
Then it's just like with the
monkey. If we intervene, we can
make the bird our ally.
Kirito
403100601_25_a
It sounds like the Sparrow with
the Slit Tongue.
Asuna
403100601_24_a
Hrrrmm...
Another folktale?
Klein
403100601_23_a
She keeps telling her husband they
should just throw the bird out
and let it fend for itself.
NPC
403100601_22_a
Well, the old man is caring for
the bird like his own family. The
old woman, on the other hand...
NPC
403100601_21_a
Kirito
403100601_20_a
Klein
403100601_19_a
Sinon
403100601_18_a
This old couple found an injured
bird and they're nursing it back
to health.
NPC
403100601_17_a
Hahaha, you really are
determined...
Asuna
403100601_16_a
Alright, let's go! This time, I'm
gonna be the one to tame it!
Klein
403100601_15_a
There's the forest. I don't think
we'll have any trouble taming
a bird in there.
Sinon
403100601_14_a
Yeah, I guess so.
Kirito
403100601_13_a
Might as well just find a bird to
tame so we can know for sure.
Klein
403100601_12_a
Maybe...
Kirito
403100601_11_a
Maybe we're supposed to get each
animal in a different way.
Asuna
403100601_10_a
I see where you're coming from,
but I don't think there's anything
to worry about.
Klein
403100601_9_a
It makes me wonder if we maybe
missed a quest or something for
the dog...
Kirito
403100601_8_a
We tamed the dog like normal, but
we got the monkey because of that
folktale-themed quest, right?
Kirito
403100601_7_a
What are you talking about?
Klein
403100601_6_a
I was just wondering if we're
going about this the right way...
Kirito
403100601_5_a
What is it, Kirito?
Asuna
403100601_4_a
Klein
403100601_3_a
Asuna
403100601_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Hmmm...
Kirito
403100601_1_a
We just need to tame a bird now.
Come on, we still have work to do!
Asuna
403100501_34_a
We're going to need you when we
attack Onigashima, Klein.
Kirito
403100501_33_a
I know... But it's a collab quest
with a Japanese-themed game and I
haven't been able to do anything...
Klein
403100501_32_a
That is why you asked me to come
in the first place. I just did
what I could to help.
Sinon
403100501_31_a
Well, Cait Siths do have a higher
chance of successfully taming
monsters, after all.
Sinon
403100501_30_a
Tch... Passed over again...
Klein
403100501_29_a
But it's definitely recognizing
you as its master, Sinon.
Kirito
403100501_28_a
It could be because you're the
one who took it down...
Kirito
403100501_27_a
Ugiii!
Monkey
403100501_26_a
Is it...surrendering?
Asuna
403100501_25_a
It's bowing to you, Sinon...
Kirito
403100501_24_a
Huh?
Sinon
403100501_23_a
Gauuuuu...
Monkey
403100501_22_a
Maybe it's still hostile?
Asuna
403100501_21_a
Owwww! What the hell is up with
you, taking a swipe at my head
like that?!
Klein
403100501_20_a
Ugaaa!
Gaauuu!
Monkey
403100501_19_a
Alright, you, listen up. You're
part of our team now, so you
better do as you're told!
Klein
403100501_18_a
Hehe, we've got it eating out of
the palm of our hand.
Klein
403100501_17_a
It's a lot calmer since we
defeated it... Maybe it's on our
side now?
Kirito
403100501_16_a
Sinon
403100501_15_a
Klein
403100501_14_a
Kirito
403100501_13_a
Uggiiii!
Monkey
403100501_12_a
Just have to line up the shot...
Fire!
Sinon
403100501_11_a
One of your arrows should be able
to make it from this distance!
Kirito
403100501_10_a
I got this.
Sinon
403100501_9_a
Grrr...
We'll never make it in time!
Kirito
403100501_8_a
We have to hurry!
Asuna
403100501_7_a
The monkey looks like it's about
ready to attack the crab!
Sinon
403100501_6_a
A monkey and a crab monster!
Klein
403100501_5_a
Over there, by that cedar!
Kirito
403100501_4_a
Sinon
403100501_3_a
Klein
403100501_2_a
bg_18_sky_morning
Look!
Kirito
403100501_1_a
Sounds like we're accepting this
quest. That crab is as good as
saved!
Asuna
403100401_24_a
Yeah. We should definitely stop
it from killing the crab.
Kirito
403100401_23_a
No way am I having a murderer
for an ally!
Klein
403100401_22_a
Wait a second! KILLING it?!
That's way uncool!
Klein
403100401_21_a
Isn't that the one that starts
with the monkey tricking the crab
and then killing it?
Sinon
403100401_20_a
Yeah, it's got to be inspired by
the Crab and the Monkey.
Kirito
403100401_19_a
Okay... Is it just me or does
that kind of sound like something
out of another folktale?
Asuna
403100401_18_a
You have to do something or that
crab doesn't stand a chance!
NPC
403100401_17_a
It's scheming to trick the crab
in some awful way.
NPC
403100401_16_a
It seems that monkey has set its
sights on a poor crab...
NPC
403100401_15_a
You are seriously obsessed with
being Momotaro...
Kirito
403100401_14_a
Then I can totally be Momotaro and
get this monkey on board with us!
Klein
403100401_13_a
Wait, are you saying we just have
to play through this scenario
to tame it?!
Klein
403100401_12_a
If you can do that through this
quest, you don't really need me.
Sinon
403100401_11_a
but maybe we can still make it
our ally somehow...
Asuna
403100401_10_a
Who knows? This monkey doesn't
sound very nice,
Asuna
403100401_9_a
So like...we can't tame it like
we did with the dog?
Klein
403100401_8_a
This must be some sort of
mini-quest.
Sinon
403100401_7_a
Did you hear that?
Kirito
403100401_6_a
I don't know what we're going
to do.
NPC
403100401_5_a
Klein
403100401_4_a
Sinon
403100401_3_a
Kirito
403100401_2_a
bg_18_sky_morning
That monkey that just started
living here is a real menace...
NPC
403100401_1_a
I'll come find you again after I'm
done. Good luck!
Silica
403100301_33_a
It really is helpful having a
Cait Sith around for this.
Asuna
403100301_32_a
Yeah, we know. It's okay. Sinon's
on her way to meet up with us.
Kirito
403100301_31_a
Ah! I'm really sorry, but I have
to go! I have other plans...
Silica
403100301_30_a
Hahaha, alright then, we'll leave
taming the monkey up to you.
Have fun!
Asuna
403100301_29_a
Momotaro's got three best buds and
he's super awesome with a
katana. That's totally ME!
Klein
403100301_28_a
We're going to fight ogres on
Onigashima!
Klein
403100301_27_a
Well, I mean, yeah! Who else
would it be?
Klein
403100301_26_a
Momotaro in this instance being...
you?
Kirito
403100301_25_a
Tch... I thought Momotaro was
the dog's best friend...
Klein
403100301_24_a
Come on, you two, play nice!
Silica
403100301_23_a
Chiiiiirp!
Pina
403100301_22_a
Grraaawww!
Monster
403100301_21_a
Ha ha, I think she's jealous!
Kirito
403100301_20_a
What's wrong, Pina?
Silica
403100301_19_a
Chiiirp!
Pina
403100301_18_a
You're like some kind of monster
whisperer, Silica.
Asuna
403100301_17_a
Grawwwww...
Monster
403100301_16_a
Ooh, you like that spot under your
chin scratched, don't you?
Silica
403100301_15_a
Hehe, awww, you're actually
pretty adorable, now that I get
good look at you...
Silica
403100301_14_a
Graaaawwww...
Monster
403100301_13_a
I guess...
Klein
403100301_12_a
Not that it really matters what
kind of dog it is, as long as
it'll fight the ogres with us.
Kirito
403100301_11_a
It's not like we're going to run
across Chihuahuas or poodles or
anything in ALO either.
Silica
403100301_10_a
Hahaha... Well, wolves are related
to dogs, after all...
Asuna
403100301_9_a
You really think this'll count as
a dog, though?
Klein
403100301_8_a
Grraaawww!
Monster
403100301_7_a
Yes! The taming succeeded!
Silica
403100301_6_a
Is it just me or does it look
way friendlier now?
Klein
403100301_5_a
Hey, the monster's getting back
up!
Kirito
403100301_4_a
Klein
403100301_3_a
Asuna
403100301_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Ah!
Silica
403100301_1_a
Good idea. Man, it's awesome
you're always so prepared...
Klein
403100201_28_a
We already have that preset
meeting spot. We should make our
way over there.
Kirito
403100201_27_a
I'll send a message to Silica
and Sinonon.
Asuna
403100201_26_a
Maybe. They do have a higher
success rate at taming than most.
Asuna
403100201_25_a
I guess... Cait Siths are good at
taming animals, maybe we should
ask one of them for help.
Klein
403100201_24_a
In any case, we should work on
getting them tamed before we go
to the island.
Kirito
403100201_23_a
Hahaha, that's right.
Asuna
403100201_22_a
What? Why?! Wait a sec... Those
are the animals in Momotaro,
aren't they?
Klein
403100201_21_a
Any player who wants to go to
Onigashima has to tame a dog,
a monkey, and a bird monster.
Kirito
403100201_20_a
Huh?
Klein
403100201_19_a
Well, it's not three "conditions"
so much as three animals...
Kirito
403100201_18_a
Seriously?! I didn't know that...
So, what are the conditions?
Klein
403100201_17_a
Well the thing is, aside from that
there are three conditions...
Asuna
403100201_16_a
Of course I know you'll show those
ogres who's boss. I know how well
you fight.
Kirito
403100201_15_a
Those ogres won't stand a chance!
Klein
403100201_14_a
Then there's nothing to worry
about! Leave it to me and my mad
katana skills!
Klein
403100201_13_a
Yeah.
Kirito
403100201_12_a
Katanas work really well against
ogres, right?
Klein
403100201_11_a
Oh, I totally know what they mean!
Klein
403100201_10_a
Apparently you have to fulfill
certain conditions in order to
beat them.
Asuna
403100201_9_a
Yeah, and they're all
ridiculously strong.
Asuna
403100201_8_a
All the mobs there are ogres.
Kirito
403100201_7_a
Yeah. The place we're going is
based on Onigashima, the island
in the Momotaro story.
Kirito
403100201_6_a
You think?
Klein
403100201_5_a
Actually, we should probably come
up with a plan of attack first
before we go barging in there.
Kirito
403100201_4_a
Asuna
403100201_3_a
Kirito
403100201_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Come on, let's get going!
That area's not gonna be
around forever!
Klein
403100201_1_a
Ahaha, I guess you're so excited
that you forgot.
Leafa
403100101_32_a
Oh, uh... It was... Um...
Asuka or something like that...
Klein
403100101_31_a
What's the name of the game ALO
is collaborating with, anyway?
Silica
403100101_30_a
What the hell?! I just explained
why this is gonna be AWESOME,
and you're still not getting it...
Klein
403100101_29_a
Yeah, you are kind of a geek,
aren't you...?
Liz
403100101_28_a
Not to mention I pretty much ONLY
use samurai equipment! So tell me,
why wouldn't I be excited?!
Klein
403100101_27_a
FURINKAZAN!
Klein
403100101_26_a
Furinkazan...
Leafa
403100101_25_a
KATANAS!
And what's my guild called?!
Klein
403100101_24_a
Um, katanas?
Silica
403100101_23_a
What's my weapon of choice?!
Klein
403100101_22_a
Oh, come on, you're totally
ignoring the best thing about me!
Klein
403100101_21_a
And THAT'S what's got you all
pumped up, Klein?
Leafa
403100101_20_a
so Japanese castles and samurai
and things appearing for no reason
would be strange.
Silica
403100101_19_a
Wow... I suppose those areas would
be just for the collab. ALO is
more European fantasy-esque,
Silica
403100101_18_a
which is why they're setting up
areas that look like that in ALO.
Klein
403100101_17_a
So, like this other game is set
in ancient Japan,
Klein
403100101_16_a
Alright, alright, enough already!
This quest is awesome 'cause it's
a collab with another VRMMO!
Klein
403100101_15_a
Lady-killer isn't exactly the
right word, because they have to
like you for that to be true...
Liz
403100101_14_a
Because we will...
Silica
403100101_13_a
Do you really want us to
answer that?
Leafa
403100101_12_a
N-No! What kind of guy do you
think I am?!
Klein
403100101_11_a
There's a cute NPC girl involved,
isn't there?
Liz
403100101_10_a
Then that must mean...
Leafa
403100101_9_a
You are...?
Silica
403100101_8_a
Sorry, I couldn't help it! It's
just I'm so excited about this
quest!
Klein
403100101_7_a
What the hell, Klein?! Don't yell
like that! You nearly gave me a
heart attack!
Liz
403100101_6_a
Wha
Leafa
403100101_5_a
Aaah!
Silica
403100101_4_a
Leafa
403100101_3_a
Silica
403100101_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
WHOAAAAAA!
Klein
403100101_1_a
Hahaha! You're one to talk!
Alicia
403001201_43_a
That's Alicia fer ya. Always
schemin'! Nahaha!
Argo
403001201_42_a
Argo
403001201_41_a
Oh yeah! And the Cait Siths are
stronger for it, as well. What's
not to love?
Alicia
403001201_40_a
Sinon
403001201_39_a
Premiere
403001201_38_a
Ha ha, you say that like it's a
bad thing! The more the merrier,
right?
Silica
403001201_37_a
Heh, the ranks of Cait Siths in
our little group continue to
swell.
Sinon
403001201_36_a
Silica
403001201_35_a
Sinon
403001201_34_a
Thank you!
Premiere
403001201_33_a
Argo
403001201_32_a
Hehe, good! From now on, you'll be
one of us then. Welcome!
Alicia
403001201_31_a
Silica
403001201_30_a
Sinon
403001201_29_a
So I am very glad to hear you say
that you will accept me.
Premiere
403001201_28_a
Yet the fact that I do not have a
race has caused me feelings of
great loneliness.
Premiere
403001201_27_a
I have experienced nothing but
joy since coming to this world.
Premiere
403001201_26_a
...
Premiere
403001201_25_a
Silica
403001201_24_a
Sinon
403001201_23_a
Well
Premiere
403001201_22_a
Argo
403001201_21_a
She won't have ears, a tail, or
wings, but we'll welcome her all
the same. Deal?
Alicia
403001201_20_a
Silica
403001201_19_a
Sinon
403001201_18_a
Huh?
Premiere
403001201_17_a
Argo
403001201_16_a
But her name going on the display
will be considered her assenting
to joining the Cait Siths.
Alicia
403001201_15_a
Silica
403001201_14_a
Sinon
403001201_13_a
Thank you very much. Both of you.
Premiere
403001201_12_a
Congratulations, Premiere!
Silica
403001201_11_a
I'm proud of you, Premiere.
Sinon
403001201_10_a
Silica
403001201_9_a
Sinon
403001201_8_a
Th-Thank you!
Premiere
403001201_7_a
Argo
403001201_6_a
Sure, why not? I'll make an
exception for you, and put
your name on the display.
Alicia
403001201_5_a
Well, she's strong enough to make
Sinon and Silica take notice,
which is no small feat.
Alicia
403001201_4_a
Yep, that's tha whole story.
So, what do we do?
Argo
403001201_3_a
Argo
403001201_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
Hah! So that's what happened!
Alicia
403001201_1_a
But ah, when ya do, I accept
thanks in the form of Yuld.
Nahaha!
Argo
403001101_32_a
Cool yer jets. I haven't even
asked yet!
Argo
403001101_31_a
Sinon
403001101_30_a
Silica
403001101_29_a
Th-Thank you...
Premiere
403001101_28_a
Thank you, Argo!
Silica
403001101_27_a
Premiere
403001101_26_a
Silica
403001101_25_a
Please do.
Sinon
403001101_24_a
Want me ta ask Alicia? It's not
like we got anythin' else ta
lose.
Argo
403001101_23_a
Ehhh, I get what yer sayin',
but rules are rules 'n' all.
Even I've gotta follow 'em.
Argo
403001101_22_a
Premiere
403001101_21_a
Sinon
403001101_20_a
Y-Yeah! What Sinon said!
Silica
403001101_19_a
Doesn't that count for anything?
Isn't it a little harsh to just
dismiss her out of hand?
Sinon
403001101_18_a
But she's fought with more grit
and determination than anyone
else here.
Sinon
403001101_17_a
Now wait a minute, Argo. Premiere
may not be a Cait Sith, or even
a player...
Sinon
403001101_16_a
Sinon
403001101_15_a
Silica
403001101_14_a
Yes. I understand...
Premiere
403001101_13_a
Ordinarily I'd give ya the option
of a rematch, but I'm gonna need
ya ta move along, Premiere.
Argo
403001101_12_a
Her record won't count when it's
all said 'n' done.
Argo
403001101_11_a
Nahaha! It's a Cait Sith-only
event anyway.
Argo
403001101_10_a
Sinon
403001101_9_a
Silica
403001101_8_a
Sinon, I...
Premiere
403001101_7_a
You did a great job, Premiere.
Sinon
403001101_6_a
No kidding. One slip-up and we
would've been dead for sure.
Sinon
403001101_5_a
You're still the Premiere I know,
though. You're really powerful for
an ALO beginner.
Silica
403001101_4_a
Sinon
403001101_3_a
Silica
403001101_2_a
bg_event_field
Y-You have defeated me...
Premiere
403001101_1_a
O-Okay!
Silica
403001001_54_a
This is gonna be good.
Give me a hand, Silica!
Sinon
403001001_53_a
Argo
403001001_52_a
Silica
403001001_51_a
Heh. I like your spirit.
You're on!
Sinon
403001001_50_a
That means it is permissible for
you to engage me in battle.
Premiere
403001001_49_a
This is the training area for
all players participating in this
event.
Premiere
403001001_48_a
Argo
403001001_47_a
Sinon
403001001_46_a
What?!
Silica
403001001_45_a
Fight me!
Premiere
403001001_44_a
Argo
403001001_43_a
Silica
403001001_42_a
Heh, you're really making strides.
Sinon
403001001_41_a
Argo
403001001_40_a
Silica
403001001_39_a
Wow, you really thought this
through, didn't you?
Sinon
403001001_38_a
I concluded that this was a matter
I had to handle myself.
Premiere
403001001_37_a
I calculated that you would press
your case with Alicia too eagerly.
Premiere
403001001_36_a
Argo
403001001_35_a
Sinon
403001001_34_a
Y-You should have said something
to one of us...
Silica
403001001_33_a
I began to desire seeing my name
on the doll display.
Premiere
403001001_32_a
This made me sad.
Premiere
403001001_31_a
Having no race would prevent me
from participating in any race-
specific event.
Premiere
403001001_30_a
When I thought about it...
Premiere
403001001_29_a
Argo
403001001_28_a
Silica
403001001_27_a
But how...?
Sinon
403001001_26_a
That made it pretty obvious that
it was you, since you were
there when Alicia explained it.
Silica
403001001_25_a
When we heard the fighter wasn't a
Cait Sith and had an avatar with
no wings, well...
Silica
403001001_24_a
Argo
403001001_23_a
Sinon
403001001_22_a
Y-Yes. This battle actually took
place inside a secret event for
Cait Sith players.
Silica
403001001_21_a
Impressing? What?
Premiere
403001001_20_a
Argo
403001001_19_a
Silica
403001001_18_a
So you were the one impressing
people with your fighting skills?
Sinon
403001001_17_a
Sinon... Silica...
Premiere
403001001_16_a
Silica
403001001_15_a
Sinon
403001001_14_a
Nahaha, we called it!
Argo
403001001_13_a
Huh?!
Premiere
403001001_12_a
Oh my gosh, Premiere!
Silica
403001001_9_a
Argo
403001001_11_a
Sinon
403001001_10_a
Argo
403001001_8_a
Silica
403001001_7_a
Premiere!
Sinon
403001001_6_a
pant
I'm... 
wheeze
Premiere
403001001_5_a
What's your deal, anyway?
Player
403001001_4_a
But you're not a Cait Sith!
Or even a fairy!
Player
403001001_3_a
Hnrk!
You're tough...
Player
403001001_2_a
bg_event_field
YAAA!
Premiere
403001001_1_a
There's only one person that
could be...
Sinon
403000901_23_a
Oh no!
Sinon
403000901_22_a
There's also talk that she's not
even a player... And her avatar
doesn't appear to have wings...
Aide
403000901_21_a
Not a Cait Sith?! We let in
players from other races?!
Silica
403000901_20_a
Get meowtta here!
Argo
403000901_19_a
From what I've heard, she's...
She's not a Cait Sith.
Aide
403000901_18_a
Right, well, um, that player...
She's, um...
Aide
403000901_17_a
I heard whoever's up there's
showin' some real potential.
Argo
403000901_16_a
Yeah. We were just headed up ta
have a look fer ourselves.
Argo
403000901_15_a
U-Um, it's about the PvP fight
happening up ahead. You know,
for the Girls' Day event...
Aide
403000901_14_a
Did somethin' happen?
Argo
403000901_13_a
Ah, this here's one of Alicia's
aides.
Argo
403000901_12_a
Who's this?
Silica
403000901_11_a
Eh? Oh, it's you...
Argo
403000901_10_a
Argo!
???
403000901_9_a
I hope they have the same amount
of guts that Premiere does...
Sinon
403000901_8_a
Yeah, and from the promising
prospect we're about to check out,
Sinon
403000901_7_a
Yeah, I could probably learn a
thing or two from Premiere's
attitude, actually.
Silica
403000901_6_a
It was fine! Premiere wanted to
improve!
Sinon
403000901_5_a
See? Argo agrees!
Silica
403000901_4_a
Sinon
403000901_3_a
Silica
403000901_2_a
bg_event_field
So that's what happened!
Yep, yer a tough coach, Sinon.
Argo
403000901_1_a
Okay! I shall defeat them!
Premiere
403000801_21_a
Silica
403000801_20_a
Okay, Premiere! Those three
monsters are all yours!
Sinon
403000801_19_a
M-Monsters! Over there!
Silica
403000801_18_a
Groooowl...
Monster
403000801_17_a
Sinooon, this is too much!
Silica
403000801_16_a
Heh. You've got guts.
I like that.
Sinon
403000801_15_a
Sinon
403000801_14_a
Premiere...
Silica
403000801_13_a
Doing so will require more effort
on my part.
Premiere
403000801_12_a
I have not been here very long...
but I must fight on the same
level as Kirito and the others...
Premiere
403000801_11_a
Yes... It will take more than
this...to defeat me...
Premiere
403000801_10_a
Silica
403000801_9_a
I'm just giving her advice and
feeding her determination.
Sinon
403000801_8_a
Nope. She said she wanted to do
this quest in the first place.
She wants to get stronger.
Sinon
403000801_7_a
Sinon
403000801_6_a
Sinon, aren't you going a little
too hard on her?
Silica
403000801_5_a
Okay!
Premiere
403000801_4_a
Silica
403000801_3_a
Hang in there, Premiere!
Sinon
403000801_2_a
bg_event_field
pant
pant
Premiere
403000801_1_a
Okay, fine. Just before Alicia
sent for me, I was on a
quest where...
Sinon
403000701_28_a
I'll do whatever it takes ta get
tha info I'm after!
Argo
403000701_27_a
Nahaha! Damn straight!
Argo
403000701_26_a
Well, there's no keeping it secret
now that you've got Argo
intrigued.
Sinon
403000701_25_a
Whatever it is, I'll pay fer it!
That's my job!
Argo
403000701_24_a
What, what? It must be somethin'
good if she's shushin' ya!
Argo
403000701_23_a
Ah! Hehe, sorry. I'll be quiet.
Silica
403000701_22_a
Hey, hey! Shush!
Sinon
403000701_21_a
Speaking of going tough
on people...
Silica
403000701_20_a
That seems to have been enough
to send them packing.
Sinon
403000701_19_a
Not really. I just fought like
I always do.
Sinon
403000701_18_a
Hehe, looks like you went hard
on 'em too.
Argo
403000701_17_a
All the players in this area have
pretty much run off.
Sinon
403000701_16_a
Sure, I'll go with you.
Sinon
403000701_15_a
Would you like to come watch with
us, Sinon?
Silica
403000701_14_a
We've heard that there's a
promising fighter just up ahead!
Silica
403000701_13_a
What's going on, you two?
Sinon
403000701_12_a
So this is where ya been, eh?
Argo
403000701_11_a
Sinon
403000701_9_a
Hey Sinon!
Silica
403000701_8_a
Argo
403000701_10_a
Seems things have died down here.
Maybe I should move to another
area.
Sinon
403000701_7_a
Very well...
Sinon
403000701_6_a
Urgh... I don't think I could
survive the number of attempts
it'd take to win. I surrender.
Player
403000701_5_a
I can do this all day.
Sinon
403000701_4_a
If you heal, you agree to
a rematch.
Sinon
403000701_3_a
Sinon
403000701_2_a
bg_event_field
Gugh!
Player
403000701_1_a
O-Okay! Good idea!
Silica
403000601_23_a
I wanna see how strong they are.
Argo
403000601_22_a
If yer comin', ya might as well
take 'em on.
Argo
403000601_21_a
Wow! Do you mind if I join you?
I want to see them too!
Silica
403000601_20_a
I was headed over there to check
'em out on Alicia's behalf.
Argo
403000601_19_a
Seems they're fightin' pretty good
in one of the areas over that way.
Argo
403000601_18_a
Yeah, 'bout that. We've got a
promisin' player.
Argo
403000601_17_a
Ha ha. Are you sure you should even
be out here on the battlefield?
I know you're busy.
Silica
403000601_16_a
Nahaha, now there's a gloomy
thought I hate ta entertain.
Argo
403000601_15_a
They did it so they could survive.
Silica
403000601_14_a
Right. That burst of strength was
a one-time thing.
Silica
403000601_13_a
Which is a whole different problem
from when we were just
overmatched.
Argo
403000601_12_a
Hm, ya think they want the glory
without puttin' in tha work, eh?
Argo
403000601_11_a
Suppose nobody wants to be in the
Cait Sith top ten?
Silica
403000601_10_a
Maybe Alicia's takin' her trainin'
idea a little too far.
Argo
403000601_9_a
Just like we've been seein' on the
battlefield.
Argo
403000601_8_a
There are also a lot of people who
assume they can't win and just
give up.
Silica
403000601_7_a
A lot of them aren't taking it
seriously.
Silica
403000601_6_a
I don't think they're any match
for me.
Silica
403000601_5_a
Well... This is going to sound
crazy coming from me, but...
Silica
403000601_4_a
Pina
403000601_3_a
Silica
403000601_2_a
bg_event_field
Is everything okay, Silica?
Argo
403000601_1_a
Heh... Yeah, I guess you're right.
Silica
403000501_29_a
Ya didn't need me ta tell ya that.
You've got tha speed ta counter
that kinda surprise attack.
Argo
403000501_28_a
Thanks for the tip, Argo.
Silica
403000501_27_a
Pina
403000501_26_a
Silica
403000501_25_a
Silica, don't ever let yer guard
down.
Argo
403000501_24_a
HAAAA!
Player D
403000501_23_a
Huh?!
Silica
403000501_22_a
Hah! You fell for it!
Player D
403000501_21_a
Heh...
Silica
403000501_20_a
Okay, you win!
G-Go easy on me!
Player D
403000501_19_a
Gwah!
Player D
403000501_18_a
Chirp chirp chirp!
Pina
403000501_17_a
Pina
403000501_16_a
Hyah!
Silica
403000501_15_a
Oh no you don't!
My prey never gets away!
Sinon
403000501_14_a
We've gotta get outta here!
Player C
403000501_13_a
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
She's pointing her bow this way!
Player B
403000501_12_a
I'll tear you down and build you
back up!
Sinon
403000501_11_a
Now I see why Alicia wants to whip
you all into shape!
Sinon
403000501_10_a
sigh
I understand how you feel.
I just wish your first instinct
wasn't to whine about it!
Sinon
403000501_9_a
That might as well be a sniper
rifle in her hands! I don't stand
a chance against her weapons!
Player C
403000501_8_a
Yeah, these don't feel like bow
attacks anymore.
Player B
403000501_7_a
Hey, doesn't that Sinon lady seem
a little OP to you?
Player B
403000501_6_a
It looks like there are only three
more players to take care of in
this area...
Sinon
403000501_5_a
Augh!
Player A
403000501_4_a
Try again!
Sinon
403000501_3_a
Sinon
403000501_2_a
bg_event_field
HAH!
Player A
403000501_1_a
Got it. The same goes for you,
Argo.
Sinon
403000401_32_a
I'll be busy keepin' things
runnin' behind tha scenes.
Argo
403000401_31_a
Hehe, well, then give it all
ya got out there.
Argo
403000401_30_a
And I'm not interested in climbing
the ranks anyway.
Sinon
403000401_29_a
The fact that Alicia asked for me
is honor enough!
Silica
403000401_28_a
Well, I would like to try, but...
Silica
403000401_27_a
Wait, Silica, ya weren't hopin'
fer that, were ya?
Argo
403000401_26_a
How? It's not like yer gonna end
up on the display yerselves.
Argo
403000401_25_a
I'm thankful for the powerful
weapons, but this feels a little
like cheating...
Silica
403000401_24_a
equipment in order ta do that,
though.
Argo
403000401_23_a
It sure was nice of her ta
lend ya her legendary
Argo
403000401_22_a
I had the same thought, nahaha.
Argo
403000401_21_a
But I suppose she is the one who
whipped those dragoons into
shape...
Sinon
403000401_20_a
She's not just training people.
She wants to raise the standard
for the whole race.
Sinon
403000401_19_a
I'm surprised Alicia's taking such
a hard line on this.
Sinon
403000401_18_a
I'll, uh...hehe...
I'll do what I can!
Silica
403000401_17_a
That's the plan. I want to help
strengthen us Cait Siths too.
Sinon
403000401_16_a
Ya better be, 'cause I don't wanna
see ya holdin' back. Ya gotta weed
out all the casual contenders.
Argo
403000401_15_a
Hi, Argo! Yes, I'm ready!
Silica
403000401_14_a
Argo.
Sinon
403000401_13_a
Silica
403000401_12_a
Sinon
403000401_11_a
All set fer the event, guys?
Argo
403000401_10_a
You...really think so?
Thanks, Sinon.
Silica
403000401_9_a
That puts you at the top of the
heap, even among the Cait Siths.
Sinon
403000401_8_a
You're speedy and you can perform
combo attacks with Pina...
Sinon
403000401_7_a
Hehe, have a little more faith in
yourself, Silica. You've got the
edge on me when it comes to ALO.
Sinon
403000401_6_a
I don't know about you, but I
don't feel one hundred percent
qualified for this.
Silica
403000401_5_a
participating in this event,
right?
Silica
403000401_4_a
I'm a little worried, Sinon. We're
supposed to train the people who
are going to be
Silica
403000401_3_a
Silica
403000401_2_a
bg_event_field
Time to give this our best shot.
Sinon
403000401_1_a
Silica
403000301_34_a
Sinon
403000301_33_a
...
Premiere
403000301_32_a
Argo
403000301_31_a
See? I knew you'd get it right
away, Sinon.
Alicia
403000301_30_a
Premiere
403000301_29_a
Silica
403000301_28_a
So you want a couple of assassins
on your event staff. That's what
this is really about, right?
Sinon
403000301_27_a
Premiere
403000301_26_a
Silica
403000301_25_a
Interesting.
Sinon
403000301_24_a
Alicia
403000301_23_a
so I agreed to produce the whole
thing. Gonna do it up right.
Argo
403000301_22_a
Nehehe, she told me I could make
a hefty pile of Yuld,
Argo
403000301_21_a
Right, Argo?
Alicia
403000301_20_a
So Argo's helping me draw up a
plan for this event that'll boost
our battle prowess.
Alicia
403000301_19_a
But with such heavy emphasis on
PvP, we need to be ready for a
fight at all times.
Alicia
403000301_18_a
so that's not a problem if you're
just messing around.
Alicia
403000301_17_a
ALO is about way more than just
battles, of course,
Alicia
403000301_16_a
Argo
403000301_15_a
We've been totally underpowered
lately, and it's bugging me.
Alicia
403000301_14_a
Premiere
403000301_13_a
Silica
403000301_12_a
Oh?
Sinon
403000301_11_a
But I also want it to make the
Cait Siths stronger as a whole.
Alicia
403000301_9_a
Argo
403000301_10_a
Argo
403000301_8_a
Well, yes, that too.
Alicia
403000301_7_a
Premiere
403000301_6_a
Silica
403000301_5_a
Are you saying it's okay for us to
participate?
Silica
403000301_4_a
Premiere
403000301_3_a
Silica
403000301_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
Okay, I see how you want the event
to work, but what does it have
to do with us?
Sinon
403000301_1_a
Argo
403000201_49_a
Right again!
Alicia
403000201_48_a
Premiere
403000201_47_a
Silica
403000201_46_a
Or like the names carved into that
statue in Aincrad's Town of
Beginnings.
Sinon
403000201_45_a
Argo
403000201_44_a
Exactly!
Alicia
403000201_43_a
Sinon
403000201_42_a
Premiere
403000201_41_a
So the champion and the runner-up
would be the empress and emperor?
Silica
403000201_40_a
Argo
403000201_39_a
And those ten will get titles
based on the dolls that go on
each step of the doll display!
Alicia
403000201_38_a
We'll find a nice big area for
melee PvP fights, which is how
we'll find our top ten warriors.
Alicia
403000201_37_a
Except we'll find out who the best
Cait Sith players are. Make sense?
Alicia
403000201_36_a
Argo
403000201_35_a
Hmm... Simply put, I'm thinking
it'll work like Sakuya's events to
determine the top Sylphs.
Alicia
403000201_34_a
Silica
403000201_33_a
Premiere
403000201_32_a
How do you propose we go about
making one?
Sinon
403000201_31_a
Silica
403000201_30_a
Premiere
403000201_29_a
Like the ones people put up in
their houses every year on
March 3rd, yeah?
Sinon
403000201_28_a
Argo
403000201_27_a
I want to make a doll display with
all the Cait Sith players!
Alicia
403000201_26_a
Premiere
403000201_25_a
Sinon
403000201_24_a
Ooh, that's right!
What kind of event?
Silica
403000201_23_a
Argo
403000201_22_a
I was thinking the Cait Siths could
put on a little player-organized
event to celebrate!
Alicia
403000201_21_a
Argo
403000201_20_a
So next week is Girls' Day, right?
The doll festival?
Alicia
403000201_19_a
Silica
403000201_18_a
Premiere
403000201_17_a
Now, onto more important matters.
Why did you call us here?
Sinon
403000201_16_a
Silica
403000201_15_a
Sinon
403000201_14_a
Thank you very much.
Premiere
403000201_13_a
Argo
403000201_12_a
Yeah? Well, as long as she just
listens, she's good to go.
Alicia
403000201_11_a
She wants ta learn more about the
Cait Siths, y'see.
Argo
403000201_10_a
Do ya mind if she sits in?
Argo
403000201_9_a
Pardon me, Alicia. She's not a
Cait Sith, but she's not exactly
a fairy either.
Argo
403000201_8_a
Argo
403000201_7_a
Ohhh, I've heard about you!
You're Premiere, the girl they
imported from SA:O, right?
Alicia
403000201_6_a
Silica
403000201_5_a
Sinon
403000201_4_a
It is a pleasure to meet you.
Premiere
403000201_3_a
Argo
403000201_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
Nice! All three of you made it!
Wait... Who's this?
Alicia
403000201_1_a
Thank you very much.
Premiere
403000101_46_a
Sinon
403000101_45_a
Silica
403000101_44_a
Sure, c'mon.
Argo
403000101_43_a
But yer not really part of any
race, so I guess there's no harm
in it.
Argo
403000101_42_a
Sinon
403000101_41_a
Silica
403000101_40_a
Ehhh... It's kinda official
Cait Sith business...
Argo
403000101_39_a
I, too, am curious as to what the
Cait Siths are doing.
Premiere
403000101_38_a
Might I be able to join you?
Premiere
403000101_37_a
Silica
403000101_36_a
Argo
403000101_35_a
Something's up...
Sinon
403000101_34_a
Nehehe...
Argo
403000101_33_a
Ya can ask her yerself once we
get there.
Argo
403000101_32_a
I'm more interested in why she
sent Argo here to collect us.
Sinon
403000101_31_a
Alicia called for us? But why?
Silica
403000101_30_a
The boss lady asked fer ya.
By name.
Argo
403000101_29_a
No, but would you mind telling
us what's going on?
Sinon
403000101_28_a
Mind comin' ta Cait Sith territory
with me?
Argo
403000101_27_a
Sinon
403000101_26_a
Silica
403000101_25_a
That so? Well then, Silica and
Sinon, we need ta talk.
Argo
403000101_24_a
That is fine. I have completed
my adventures for today.
Premiere
403000101_23_a
Sinon
403000101_22_a
Silica
403000101_21_a
Nothin' personal, Premiere.
Argo
403000101_20_a
Sinon
403000101_19_a
Silica
403000101_18_a
And yer as chipper as ever. But
today I'm lookin' fer these two
specifically.
Argo
403000101_17_a
It has been some time, Argo.
Premiere
403000101_16_a
Sinon
403000101_15_a
Silica
403000101_14_a
And if it isn't Premiere. Guess
they really did get ya imported
inta ALO.
Argo
403000101_13_a
What's up?
Sinon
403000101_12_a
Is that you, Argo?
Silica
403000101_11_a
Silica
403000101_9_a
Ah, there ya are. I been lookin'
fer you two.
Argo
403000101_8_a
Sinon
403000101_10_a
Agreed!
Premiere
403000101_7_a
Silica
403000101_6_a
The three of us should go on
another quest sometime.
Sinon
403000101_5_a
Sinon
403000101_4_a
You're very welcome, Premiere!
Silica
403000101_3_a
That was very enjoyable.
Premiere
403000101_2_a
bg_event_field
Thank you for your help, Silica
and Sinon.
Premiere
403000101_1_a
Ha ha, I don't doubt you will,
Yui!
Kirito
402900906_23_a
I'll get super strong,
just you wait!
Yui
402900906_22_a
Now that I can fight, I'll do my
utmost to get strong enough to
fight beside you!
Yui
402900906_21_a
Th-That's true...
But I won't give up!
Yui
402900906_20_a
You've got a lot of training to do
before you're strong enough to
take on the same quests we do.
Asuna
402900906_19_a
Ahaha, looks that way.
Asuna
402900906_18_a
Ha ha, just as I thought. All your
stats and levels are at starting
values.
Kirito
402900906_17_a
Hmm... Huh?
Asuna
402900906_16_a
Y-Yeah... Here they are.
Yui
402900906_15_a
We're counting on you, Yui.
But let's not get ahead of
ourselves. Can I see your stats?
Kirito
402900906_14_a
I can help everyone in battle
and keep Mommy and Daddy safe!
Yui
402900906_13_a
It has! Now I can do more than
just give you information and
advice.
Yui
402900906_12_a
Hehe, but hurray! Yui's wish has
finally been granted!
Asuna
402900906_11_a
Yeah, that's a great idea.
Kirito
402900906_10_a
You're right, Daddy! I have to go
and thank everyone for everything
they did for me!
Yui
402900906_9_a
for thinking to look for a quest.
You for finding it, and Asuna for
beating it. This is OUR victory.
Kirito
402900906_8_a
We only did it because we worked
together. The whole combat party
for their hard work. Sugu
Kirito
402900906_7_a
But this isn't my victory alone.
Kirito
402900906_6_a
Ha ha, I'm very happy for you.
Kirito
402900906_5_a
Now I can finally fight alongside
everyone! It's a total class
change!
Yui
402900906_4_a
Kirito
402900906_3_a

Daddy, thank you so much!
Yui
402900906_1_a
Yeah! Let's do it!
Leafa
402900804_39_a
We'll catch up to the leaders,
overtake them, and claim the
number one spot for our own!
Kirito
402900804_38_a
Leafa
402900804_37_a
Alright, guys, let's do this!
Kirito
402900804_36_a
Hehe, but we can't really talk,
can we? I feel like a million
bucks!
Lisbeth
402900804_35_a
Well, that was quick. Doesn't take
much to brighten his day, huh?
Sinon
402900804_34_a
Lisbeth
402900804_33_a
Sinon
402900804_32_a
Yeah! And it's all thanks to Yui
and Asuna's cheers!
Silica
402900804_31_a
Hehe, wow, Kirito! Your energy
just shot through the roof!
Leafa
402900804_30_a
Leafa
402900804_29_a
Thanks, Yui!
Kirito
402900804_28_a
It doesn't grant any actual buffs!
But, regardless, I'll cheer my
heart out for you!
Yui
402900804_27_a
Just so you know, my outfit is
just a handmade copy!
Yui
402900804_26_a
Yui
402900804_25_a
Right!
Leave it to us!
Asuna
402900804_24_a
Your backup saved the day! We're
counting on a rebuff when this
wears off!
Kirito
402900804_23_a
Leafa
402900804_22_a
Asuna! Yui!
Kirito
402900804_21_a
Yup, and just in the nick of time.
Lisbeth
402900804_20_a
But their cheers have powered you
up too, right?

Kirito, you must realize that!

It'll be tough to be down one,

it'll all be for nothing!
Lisbeth

the monsters are getting
ridiculously overpowered.

Sinon
402900706_48_a
Now let's do it!
Kirito
402900706_47_a
I'm sorry, Sinon. And...thank you.
Kirito
402900706_46_a
I've got your back. I'll follow
you into the depths of hell,
grinning the whole time!
Sinon
402900706_45_a
Anyway, forget about that
and let's go.
Sinon
402900706_44_a
N-Nope, not a word.
Sinon
402900706_43_a
Hmm? Sorry, Sinon.
Did you say something?
Kirito
402900706_42_a
But I guess that's just part of
your charm.
Sinon
402900706_41_a
You try to act all tough and cool,
but you're quick to let your
temper get the better of you...
Sinon
402900706_40_a
Ugh. You never change.
Just like me...
Sinon
402900706_39_a
This is for Yui! For Yui!! I can't
let us fail and disappoint her!
Kirito
402900706_38_a
Don't worry, I'm fine! I won't
collapse until we win this
stupid thing!
Kirito
402900706_37_a
It's all over if that happens!
Sinon
402900706_36_a
Keep this up, and you'll black
out! Then your AmuSphere will
disconnect you!
Sinon
402900706_35_a
You've been fighting for hours
straight now!
Sinon
402900706_34_a
Wait, Kirito!
Come back here!!
Sinon
402900706_33_a
Ugh! I can't just sit here!
I'm heading back in!
Kirito
402900706_32_a
They've really widened the gap
again, haven't they? It's going to
be really hard to catch up...
Sinon
402900706_31_a
They are?
Oh...
Sinon
402900706_30_a
The top-ranking parties' scores
are displayed on that big screen
over there...
Kirito
402900706_29_a
Kirito, what's wrong?
Sinon
402900706_28_a
Hmm...
Ah! Damn!
Kirito
402900706_27_a
Kirito
402900706_26_a
...
Sinon
402900706_25_a
R-Right...
Kirito
402900706_24_a
Let Leafa and Silica hold the line
for now and take this opportunity
to recover.
Sinon
402900706_23_a
Don't be too hard on yourself,
Kirito. Anyone would lose focus
fighting as long as we have.
Sinon
402900706_22_a
Sinon
402900706_21_a
But...!
Sorry... You're right, Silica...
Kirito
402900706_20_a
Lisbeth
402900706_19_a
If we lose even one party member,
there's no way we'll win!
Silica
402900706_18_a
There's no reviving in this
tournament! We have to be careful!
Silica
402900706_17_a
Lisbeth
402900706_16_a
Leafa
402900706_15_a
Kirito, please calm down! I know
we're pressed for time, but if we
push it, we'll just get taken out!
Silica
402900706_14_a
Sinon
402900706_13_a
B-But we won't make any progress
at this rate!
Kirito
402900706_12_a
Lisbeth
402900706_11_a
Silica and I will hold them back
while you get on your feet!
Leafa
402900706_10_a
Silica
402900706_9_a
Leafa
402900706_8_a

Lisbeth
402900706_7_a
S-Sinon, sorry!

402900604_17_a
Okay, Mommy!
Yui
402900604_16_a
Kirito and the others are still
fighting their hearts out in
there!
Asuna
402900604_15_a
Of course! Now come on,
let's get back!
Asuna
402900604_14_a
D-Do you really think so?
Yui
402900604_13_a
Hehe, true, but I bet seeing how
adorable you look will give him
one serious morale boost!
Asuna
402900604_12_a
Yeah... But sadly, only yours
actually grants the support buff.
Yui
402900604_11_a
I bet Kirito's going to be really
surprised to see you in this
outfit, Yui!
Asuna
402900604_10_a
Yeah! She's such a nice person!
Yui
402900604_9_a
But I'm definitely really glad
she could make a smaller
version of the one I got too!
Asuna
402900604_8_a
Yeah, I was surprised.
Asuna
402900604_7_a
You bet! I'm super glad Ashley
could make me a cheerleader outfit
just like yours!
Yui
402900604_6_a
Hehe. Yui, you're pretty happy
about this too, aren't you?
Asuna
402900604_5_a
We sure did! But... Hehehe...
Yui
402900604_4_a
Yeah! We got the cheerleader
outfit!
Asuna
402900604_3_a
Asuna
402900604_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Mommy! We did it!
Yui
402900604_1_a
Asuna
402900601_23_a
That's right!
Yui
402900601_22_a
Right! Then let's hurry! We've got
to do everything we can to help
the others!
Asuna
402900601_21_a
It's my guess that very few
players have realized this yet.
Yui
402900601_20_a
I see... So this outfit really was
made just for tournaments...
Asuna
402900601_19_a
The way it was phrased implies
that they were referring to the
buff from the cheerleader outfit.
Yui
402900601_18_a
Remember? The tournament rules
stated that "cheering" was
permitted.
Yui
402900601_17_a
Wh-What do you mean?
Asuna
402900601_16_a
Nope! Cheering is A-OK! That's why
Daddy was so sure this quest was
designed for this tournament!
Yui
402900601_15_a
We're not participating in the
tournament. Isn't it cheating to
help out just one party?
Asuna
402900601_14_a
That's correct.
Yui
402900601_13_a
But one thing still worries me.
Cheering is something we have to
do from the sidelines, right?
Asuna
402900601_12_a
Mommy...
Yui
402900601_11_a
but that's because you're our
daughter! It's his job to make you
happy, hehe.
Asuna
402900601_10_a
Don't worry about that, Yui!
It's true that Kirito hasn't
worked this hard in a while,
Asuna
402900601_9_a
Everyone's trying their best for
my sake, but all I can do is sit
here and watch...
Yui
402900601_8_a
But...this entire affair is my
fault. I was the one who wanted to
be able to fight...
Yui
402900601_7_a
True, but I wouldn't even have the
chance to try if you didn't find
it. So, seriously, thank you!
Asuna
402900601_6_a
Even if you were to attempt this
quest, there's no guarantee that
the outfit will drop...
Yui
402900601_5_a
No, Mommy, it's still too early to
celebrate.
Yui
402900601_4_a
We might just have a chance,
and it's all thanks to you finding
this quest!
Asuna
402900601_3_a
Yui
402900601_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Yui, thank you so much!
Asuna
402900601_1_a
In the tournament area?!
So it works here!
Kirito
402900506_44_a
Yes, that is correct. However,
there is a condition. It only
works in a specific location.
Yui
402900506_43_a
Yui
402900506_42_a
Kirito
402900506_41_a
So, in other words, we use that
and we get ridiculously strong?
Leafa
402900506_40_a
It says that cheering for someone
acts as a super-powered form of
buff magic...
Asuna
402900506_39_a
And that means...?
Kirito
402900506_38_a
According to this, equipping this
special outfit grants the ability
to "cheer on" other players.
Yui
402900506_37_a
It looks like the quest is pretty
short, but the target monster's no
pushover.
Kirito
402900506_36_a
A quest to make a cheerleading
outfit... Interesting.
Kirito
402900506_35_a
Whoa! That's so cute!
Is this a cheerleader outfit?
Asuna
402900506_34_a
It's a mini-quest to make a
unique outfit.
Yui
402900506_33_a
Hmm...?
Kirito
402900506_32_a
Asuna
402900506_31_a
Kirito
402900506_30_a
Mommy, Daddy, look at this, please.
Yui
402900506_29_a
Silica
402900506_28_a
Sinon
402900506_27_a
Well, sure... I suppose pinning
all our hopes on your vague
hunch is one strategy.
Lisbeth
402900506_26_a
That's plausible. Instead of
announcing it, they let the
smart players figure it out.
Leafa
402900506_25_a
Yui
402900506_24_a
Leafa
402900506_23_a
No idea. Maybe a temporary buff
or something similar...?
Kirito
402900506_22_a
Lisbeth
402900506_21_a
Sinon
402900506_20_a
Even the odds?
Specifically, what?
Silica
402900506_19_a
If so, maybe they added something
that could help other players even
the odds.
Kirito
402900506_18_a
Maybe the devs anticipated that
players with loads of free time
would have an inherent advantage.
Kirito
402900506_17_a
Yui
402900506_16_a
Leafa
402900506_15_a
What Sugu said got me thinking...
Kirito
402900506_14_a
I second that question. If you
have time to look at quests, rest
up or get back to the competition.
Lisbeth
402900506_13_a
Silica
402900506_12_a
Lisbeth
402900506_11_a
Hey, Kirito? Just what are you
looking for?
Sinon
402900506_10_a
Nothing in the event quests...
Kirito
402900506_9_a
Can I see those too?
Kirito
402900506_8_a
There are also a number of small
side quests not on this list,
Daddy.
Yui
402900506_7_a
Yui
402900506_6_a
Kirito
402900506_5_a
There's quite a lot of them...
ALO's always adding new content.
Leafa
402900506_4_a
Yui
402900506_3_a
Kirito
402900506_2_a
bg_event_alo_arena
Well, this is pretty much it for
new event quests...
Asuna
402900506_1_a
I want you to look into any quests
that have been added recently!
Kirito
402900404_79_a
Lisbeth
402900404_78_a
Sinon
402900404_77_a
Can someone get Asuna and Yui?
Kirito
402900404_76_a
Pina
402900404_75_a
Leafa
402900404_74_a
Kirito, is something the matter?
Silica
402900404_73_a
Wait a sec... Maybe...
Kirito
402900404_72_a
That's a good point. A lot of
parties gave up when they saw how
far ahead the top rankers were.
Lisbeth
402900404_71_a
Lisbeth
402900404_70_a
Sinon
402900404_69_a
...
Kirito
402900404_68_a
A super high-profile event like
this isn't exciting unless there's
something to balance things out...
Leafa
402900404_67_a
Like, shouldn't there be something
players with less time can do to
catch up?
Leafa
402900404_66_a
Pina
402900404_65_a
Silica
402900404_64_a
No matter how unbalanced this type
of event is by nature, doesn't it
seem a little too unfair?
Leafa
402900404_63_a
Lisbeth
402900404_62_a
Sinon
402900404_61_a
Yeah, Sugu? What is it?
Kirito
402900404_60_a
But wait a sec...
Something's bothering me.
Leafa
402900404_59_a

Yeah, I hate to admit it...

Lisbeth
402900404_55_a
Kirito
402900404_54_a
Agreed, but they are right. It'll
be nearly impossible to win this
with skill and power alone.
Sinon
402900404_53_a
Pina
402900404_52_a
Leafa
402900404_51_a
Grr, that made me SO MAD!

Kirito
402900404_47_a
Player C
402900404_46_a
Player B
402900404_45_a
Honestly, this quest is pretty
unfair.
Player A
402900404_44_a
Player C
402900404_43_a
Player B
402900404_42_a
Exactly. Students should focus on
their studies, not on gaming.
Player A
402900404_41_a
Sinon
402900404_40_a
Lisbeth
402900404_39_a
You have to be able to sacrifice
tons of real world time to win a
tournament like this.
Kirito
402900404_38_a
Liz, let it go. These guys are
rude as hell, but they mean well.
Kirito
402900404_37_a
Kirito

Sinon
402900404_35_a
Oh, you listen here, you
Lisbeth
402900404_34_a
Kids who have to spend half their
day in high school have no chance
of being the best.
Player A
402900404_33_a
Player C
402900404_32_a
Player B
402900404_31_a
It's a sad fact, but the highest
ranked players in any MMO are
usually jobless or work from home.
Player A
402900404_30_a
Leafa
402900404_29_a
Sinon
402900404_28_a
Yeah, I can't deny that.
Kirito
402900404_27_a
I mean, who wouldn't want to party
up with their favorite NPC?
It's a gamer's dream come true.
Player C
402900404_26_a
The reward for this event's pretty
unique, so all the top-ranking
players are taking part.
Player B
402900404_25_a
Player C
402900404_24_a
Player B
402900404_23_a
Well, sorry. But still, high school
kids like you shouldn't push
yourselves.
Player A
402900404_22_a
Leafa
402900404_21_a
Kirito
402900404_20_a
What the hell? Don't bring up
real-world stuff in-game.
What were you, born yesterday?
Sinon
402900404_19_a
Player C
402900404_18_a
Player B
402900404_17_a
Oh, so you guys are students?
You can't play during the day,
so high school I take it? 
Player A
402900404_16_a
Leafa
402900404_15_a
Sinon
402900404_14_a
Oh. Cool. Well, we only have time
to play at night, so we push
while we can.
Kirito
402900404_13_a
So we came to check out the
hotshot competition.
Player B
402900404_12_a
Well, we heard that you shoot
up in the rankings every night,
but never play during the day.
Player B
402900404_9_a
Player C
402900404_11_a
Player A
402900404_10_a
So...what can we do for you?
Kirito
402900404_8_a
Kirito, these guys are pretty far
above us in the rankings right
now.

Sinon
402900401_44_a
Yeah! Let's do everything we can!
Leafa
402900401_43_a
Kirito
402900401_42_a
Leafa
402900401_41_a
Understood. That seems like our
only option.
Sinon
402900401_40_a
Pina
402900401_39_a
Silica
402900401_38_a
Right, you got it.
Lisbeth
402900401_37_a
No holding back on healing or buff
items
we need every advantage we
can get.
Kirito
402900401_36_a
Everyone, for now, our only option
is to take these guys out as
quickly as possible.
Kirito
402900401_35_a
Sinon
402900401_34_a
Leafa
402900401_33_a
Ugh, and we don't even have time
to come up with a plan...
Kirito
402900401_32_a
Pina
402900401_31_a
Lisbeth
402900401_30_a
Um, attention!
Monsters incoming!
Silica
402900401_29_a
We're only losing because we don't
have enough time...
Sinon
402900401_28_a
This is really irritating.
We're way better than the
competition.
Sinon
402900401_27_a
Damn... There's gotta be
something we can do...
Kirito
402900401_26_a
we're just overtaken again during
the day...
Kirito
402900401_25_a
Even if we cut down on sleep to
catch up at night,
Kirito
402900401_24_a
Sinon
402900401_23_a
Leafa
402900401_22_a
Still, it pains me to admit it,
but we're falling behind...

Kirito
402900401_17_a
Leafa
402900401_16_a
Doubtful. They all must have lots
of time to kill: college students
and the unemployed, most likely.
Sinon
402900401_15_a
Pina
402900401_14_a
Silica
402900401_13_a
Seriously! What is with the
top-ranking parties?!
Do they even sleep?!
Lisbeth
402900401_12_a
A multi-day marathon quest like
this is killer for students like
us...
Sinon
402900401_11_a
I don't doubt it. Between school
and this competition, we've been
going at it nonstop for days.
Leafa
402900401_10_a
Sinon
402900401_9_a

Got it, Daddy! We'll cheer until
we can't cheer no more!
Yui
402900304_46_a
Friends can't help directly,
but the flier said specifically
that "cheering" was okay!
Kirito
402900304_45_a
Sinon
402900304_44_a
Leafa
402900304_43_a
Hahaha. Well, don't get too
relaxed! I expect to hear some
cheers!
Kirito
402900304_42_a
Yui
402900304_41_a
Thank you, Sinonon...
We will!
Asuna
402900304_40_a
Kirito
402900304_39_a
Asuna, Yui, don't worry. We WILL
win this, so just sit back and
enjoy the action.
Sinon
402900304_38_a
Leafa
402900304_37_a
Kirito
402900304_36_a
Ah, I see. Well, in that case,
I approve.
Sinon
402900304_35_a
Asuna
402900304_34_a
Daddy...
Yui
402900304_33_a
I knew she'd be worried sick just
watching us fight. I didn't want
her to be alone on the sidelines.
Kirito
402900304_32_a
Asuna is an amazing fighter,
but I wanted her to keep Yui
company for this one.
Kirito
402900304_31_a
Oh, that.
Kirito
402900304_30_a
Ugh. You're dense. I'm saying,
why isn't Asuna part of the team?
Sinon
402900304_29_a
Huh?
Kirito
402900304_28_a
Leafa
402900304_27_a
Kirito
402900304_26_a
But, Kirito, I have to ask:
why this particular party lineup?
Sinon
402900304_25_a
Asuna
402900304_24_a
Leafa! Thank you!
Yui
402900304_23_a
Sinon
402900304_22_a
Kirito
402900304_21_a
These monsters are a handful. But
don't worry, Yui! We'll win it
for sure!
Leafa
402900304_20_a
Asuna
402900304_19_a
H-How is everyone doing?
How goes the battle?
Yui
402900304_18_a
Leafa
402900304_17_a
Sinon
402900304_16_a
Oh, hey Asuna. Hey Yui.
Kirito
402900304_15_a
Yui
402900304_14_a
Great job out there, people!
Asuna
402900304_13_a
Leafa
402900304_12_a
Sinon
402900304_11_a
Thanks, everyone. I owe you.
Kirito
402900304_10_a
Chirp!
Pina
402900304_9_a
Lisbeth
402900304_8_a
Pina
402900304_7_a
True... But we're gonna win this!
For Yui!
Silica
402900304_6_a
Seriously...
Still, only a few teams have been
knocked out so far.
Leafa
402900304_5_a
Whew. They're certainly throwing
tough monsters at us right from
the get-go.
Sinon
402900304_4_a
Leafa
402900304_3_a
Sinon

bg_event_alo_arena
Great, let's take a moment to
catch our breath.
Kirito
402900304_1_a
Mommy, thank you!
Yui
402900204_33_a
Let's go ask Liz, Sinonon,
and everyone else!
Asuna
402900204_32_a
Hehe, in that case, it's time to
start getting the team together!
Asuna
402900204_31_a
Daddy, you're the best!
Thank you so much!
Yui
402900204_30_a
And I'll do my best to win!
I'll make your dream a reality!
Kirito
402900204_29_a
Yui, you don't even have to ask.
Of course I'll take part in the
tournament.
Kirito
402900204_28_a
Daddy...
Yui
402900204_27_a
I bet a lot of players wish they
could team up with them and not
just see them for a one-off quest.
Kirito
402900204_26_a
ALO is filled with cool NPC side
characters, like gods and giants.
Kirito
402900204_25_a
But, well, I can see why they
did it...
Kirito
402900204_24_a
That's fantastic. I never thought
they'd make a reward like this!
Asuna
402900204_23_a
I said yes way! If you win this,
I'll be able to fight alongside
you, Daddy!
Yui
402900204_22_a
No waaay!
Kirito
402900204_21_a
Gets to pick an NPC and add them
to their party as a combat-capable
character!
Yui
402900204_20_a
Yes way! The party that wins
the competition...
Yui
402900204_19_a
Wait! No way!
Asuna
402900204_18_a
What about the reward?
Kirito
402900204_17_a
That's all great, but look at
this! The reward!
Yui
402900204_16_a
I'm also seeing a note on how it's
themed after the gladiatorial
fights in ancient Rome.
Kirito
402900204_15_a
It does say that you can take
breaks or bow out partway through.
Asuna
402900204_14_a
In other words, this is a hardcore
endurance test.
Kirito
402900204_13_a
Yeah, it says that it'll likely
take a few days before the winning
team claws their way to the top.
Kirito
402900204_12_a
Ouch, sounds like the competition
will be pretty tough...
Asuna
402900204_11_a
The monsters will grow steadily
stronger as time goes on. It's
similar to a boss raid, actually.
Yui
402900204_10_a
You fight waves of monsters in an
arena, and the party that defeats
the most is the winner.
Yui
402900204_9_a
Kirito
402900204_8_a
Yes, but this one is unique.
It's party-based, but not PvP.
Yui
402900204_7_a
An announcement for a new
tournament?
Kirito
402900204_6_a
Yui
402900204_5_a
What is it, Yui?
Let's see...
Kirito
402900204_4_a
Asuna
402900204_3_a
Kirito
402900204_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Mommy, Daddy!
Look at this!
Yui
402900204_1_a
...
Yui
402900106_32_a
Yeah. Well, it wouldn't be hard
for a dev, anyway...
Kirito
402900106_31_a
In other words, you think Yui's
data could be adjusted to let her
fight?
Asuna
402900106_30_a
but I don't think it would be that
hard to program in battle stats
for an NPC.
Kirito
402900106_29_a
I don't know any NPCs here with
levels and skills you can
customize or train,
Kirito
402900106_28_a
That's true. Many NPCs can fight
alongside players. However, they
don't have levels or stats.
Yui
402900106_27_a
A lot of quests have NPCs join
your party as temporary allies.
Kirito
402900106_26_a
S-Sorry... But Strea's not the
only NPC that can fight, right?
Kirito
402900106_25_a
You just had to go and throw ALL
that effort away, didn't you?
Asuna
402900106_24_a
Ugh, Kirito! And I just convinced
Yui that everything was okay!
Asuna
402900106_23_a
Really? Do you mean it, Daddy?!
Yui
402900106_22_a
Asuna
402900106_21_a
But still, saying that...
It shouldn't be impossible.
Kirito
402900106_20_a
Oh... Okay...
Yui
402900106_19_a
You are you. You don't need to
try to be something you're not to
make us happy.
Asuna
402900106_18_a
So you don't have to compare
yourself to Strea or Pina, okay?
Asuna
402900106_17_a
But, more importantly, just being
with you makes us happy.
Asuna
402900106_16_a
Kirito
402900106_15_a
Having you advise us in battle
and in quests is a lifesaver.
Asuna
402900106_14_a
You don't have to fight.
You already help us so much.
Asuna
402900106_13_a
Mommy...
Yui
402900106_12_a
Yui, listen.
Asuna
402900106_11_a
What do I have to do to be like
them? To be able to fight?
Yui
402900106_10_a
Strea and Pina are also residents
of the virtual world, but despite
that they can fight alongside you.
Yui
402900106_9_a
True... I really don't have an
answer. That's just what happened
when she converted to ALO.
Kirito
402900106_8_a
But Strea's an MHCP too.
Yui
402900106_7_a
Well, you were originally an MHCP,
and now you're a pixie:
a player-support character.
Kirito
402900106_6_a
Why can't I fight?
Yui
402900106_5_a
Yes, Yui, what is it?
Kirito
402900106_4_a
Asuna
402900106_3_a
Kirito
402900106_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Daddy, question!
Yui
402900106_1_a
Great idea!
Asuna
402701101_41_a
Yay!
Silica
402701101_40_a
It's gotta be.
Ooh, the download's finished!
Come on, we can listen together!
Liz
402701101_39_a
Hahaha, you're right.
It's probably just my imagination.
Asuna
402701101_38_a
Liz
402701101_37_a
But I'm pretty sure Yuna's an
original character made for OS...
Silica
402701101_36_a
Even Kirito figured that must have
been some sort of NPC singing
for that event...
Asuna
402701101_35_a
W-Well...
Asuna
402701101_34_a
What...?
You can't mean...
Silica
402701101_33_a
Y-Yeah...
Asuna
402701101_32_a
Back when? You mean the Samurai
Soul thing? The lament?
Liz
402701101_31_a
It sounds just like the one we
heard singing back then...
Asuna
402701101_30_a
Uh... It's...Yuna's voice...
Asuna
402701101_29_a
Asuna, what's wrong?
Silica
402701101_28_a
...
Asuna
402701101_27_a
Ditto!
Liz
402701101_26_a
I'm going to download it right
now!
Silica
402701101_25_a
Oh, I've heard this before.
It's pretty good.
Asuna
402701101_24_a
Silica
402701101_23_a
They call her an "AR pop star"
like it's a bad thing, but she
can actually sing. Listen!
Liz
402701101_22_a
Yuna's that virtual singer that
shows up in OS, right?
Asuna
402701101_21_a
That's right!
It comes out today!
Silica
402701101_20_a
Oh, hey, speaking of singing!
Yuna's new single!
Liz
402701101_19_a
Hahaha, me too.
Asuna
402701101_18_a
Ooh, I really hope the monster
in OS everyone's talking about
isn't the Samurai Lord!
Silica
402701101_17_a
Sheesh...
Renegades... Samurai spirits...
Nooo thank you!
Liz
402701101_16_a
he vanished with the usual effect.
We didn't see him again. Neither
did anyone on the Assault Team.
Asuna
402701101_15_a
No. The lament seemed to really
hurt the Samurai Soul, and when
we beat him,
Asuna
402701101_14_a
Did anyone else from the Assault
Team get attacked after that?
Liz
402701101_13_a
...for doing something like
that for my sake.
Asuna
402701101_12_a
Ahaha... Yeah. But I can't really
get mad at him...
Asuna
402701101_11_a
Me too! Kirito really is reckless
to a fault, isn't he?
Silica
402701101_10_a
Whoa... Eeesh, that story gave
me goosebumps!
Liz
402701101_9_a
Then the lament would start, which
would let you defeat him once and
for all. That's what I think.
Asuna
402701101_8_a
The game scenario was probably set
so that would be the last time the
Samurai Soul would revive.
Asuna
402701101_7_a
It must have been.
Asuna
402701101_6_a
Singing a lament?
Silica
402701101_5_a
That's when we heard it... A soft,
solemn, almost saintly voice
singing...
Asuna
402701101_4_a
Silica
402701101_3_a
Asuna

bg_os_cafe
So then what happened?!
Liz
402701101_1_a
Yeah, it probably wouldn't work...
Ahahaha...
We're screwed...
Asuna
402701001_35_a
Songs?
Like, sing him a lullaby like he's
a big, scary baby?
Kirito
402701001_34_a
Um... Uh...
Sometimes singing laments can
appease restless spirits...
Asuna
402701001_33_a
As far as I know, skills like that
don't exist in SAO...
Kirito
402701001_32_a
Those are the only solutions
I can think of...
Asuna
402701001_31_a
In the real world, I'd probably
call someone to do a purifying
ceremony or an exorcism...
Asuna
402701001_30_a
But...what are we gonna do...?
Asuna
402701001_29_a
GRAAAAAAAHHHH!
Samurai Soul
402701001_28_a
Thanks... I owe you one.
Kirito
402701001_27_a
Here, I can give you some potions,
so drink one! This is
far from over!
Asuna
402701001_26_a
Don't be stupid! No way am I
leaving you just to save myself!
Asuna
402701001_25_a
Asuna, you should get out of here!
Kirito
402701001_24_a
It's going to be just like what
that old NPC said...
Asuna
402701001_23_a
I think so... At this rate, he'll
probably turn into some sort of
immortal enemy...
Kirito
402701001_22_a
So the time it takes him to
revive is shortening...
Asuna
402701001_21_a
Yeah, I did...
But he came back almost
immediately afterwards...
Kirito
402701001_20_a
Huh? Does that mean you've
already beat him once?
Asuna
402701001_19_a
We're going to have to fight him
who knows how many times, but
I can take him by myself...
Kirito
402701001_18_a
But you're terrified of ghosts,
Asuna...
Kirito
402701001_17_a
You know better than anyone that
the Samurai Soul could show up
at any time!
Asuna
402701001_16_a
What were you thinking,
running off on your own like that?
Asuna
402701001_15_a
Well, I've been better...
Kirito
402701001_14_a
Kirito! Are you okay?!
Asuna
402701001_13_a
Asuna
402701001_12_a
Asuna, is that you?!
Kirito
402701001_11_a
KIIIRIIITOOO!
???
402701001_10_a
Tch... Guess this is where my luck
as a solo player runs out...!
Kirito
402701001_9_a
Grrr... I'm almost out of HP
AND potions...!
Kirito
402701001_8_a
What the hell?! He's never come
back THIS quickly before!
Kirito
402701001_7_a
GRAAAAAAAAH!!
Samurai Soul
402701001_6_a
What-?!
Kirito
402701001_5_a
Grraaaah...
Grwaaaaaaahhh!!
Samurai Soul
402701001_4_a
Yes, we beat him!
Kirito
402701001_3_a
Kirito
402701001_2_a
bg_06_graveyard
GRAAAAAGHH!!
Samurai Soul
402701001_1_a
I know...
Ehehe...
Asuna
402700901_28_a
Huh? What are you talking about?
I'm right here.
Kirito
402700901_27_a
I just got the feeling that you
went off somewhere really
far away...
Asuna
402700901_26_a
Oh, um-
Asuna
402700901_25_a
What is it?
Kirito
402700901_24_a
Hey, Kirito?
Asuna
402700901_23_a
Right...
Kirito
402700901_22_a
Now all that's left is to find out
how we kill him so he stays dead.
Asuna
402700901_21_a
I already asked Argo to warn
anyone who was there that day
about what's happening.
Kirito
402700901_20_a
So that's how he's choosing
his victims... It makes sense...
Asuna
402700901_19_a
And I bet he's going after any
Assault Team member who was
there when we took him down.
Kirito
402700901_18_a
is because we defeated him
when he was the Samurai Lord.
Kirito
402700901_17_a
I bet you anything that
the reason he's after us
Kirito
402700901_16_a
Yeah...
Asuna
402700901_15_a
But we need to worry about how
we're going to beat that monster
once and for all...
Kirito
402700901_14_a
Okay...
Asuna
402700901_13_a
It's fine, really.
You can thank Argo next time
we see her.
Kirito
402700901_12_a
I see...
Sorry to cause such a fuss...
Asuna
402700901_11_a
Ha ha, if I had tried to touch you,
I would've been locked up faster
than you can say "sword skill."
Kirito
402700901_10_a
I what...? Argo...?
Asuna
402700901_9_a
You fainted after we heard about
the Samurai Soul from that old
man. Argo carried you here.
Kirito
402700901_8_a
What?!
Wh-What happened?!
Asuna
402700901_7_a
A room in an inn.
Kirito
402700901_6_a
Wh-Where am I?!
Asuna
402700901_5_a
Hm...? Kirito?
What...?
Asuna
402700901_4_a
Asuna, are you okay?
Kirito
402700901_3_a
Kirito
402700901_2_a
bg_04_inn_bed
Ugh...
Asuna
402700901_1_a
But...
What do we do...?
Kirito
402700801_34_a
L-Looks like they do... She'll
come to in a minute, I think...
Argo
402700801_33_a
Asuna!
People don't actually faint
from fear, do they?!
Kirito
402700801_32_a
Kirito
402700801_31_a
Whoa, Asu-! She fainted!
Argo
402700801_30_a
Hnnnggh...
Asuna
402700801_29_a
Haunt us...
Till the end...
Relentless...
Asuna
402700801_28_a
I have no time for further
questions. Farewell, adventurers...
NPC
402700801_27_a
Wh-What...?
Kirito
402700801_26_a
He will haunt you till the end of
your days...which will not
be much longer...
NPC
402700801_25_a
Even if you kill him, he will rise
again, and again, until he has
claimed his vengeance...
NPC
402700801_24_a
That fiend goes after any it holds
a grudge against with relentless
persistence.
NPC
402700801_23_a
That's impossible! We've already
taken down two of them!
Kirito
402700801_22_a
N-No way!
Asuna
402700801_21_a
Argo
402700801_20_a
Wait-what?!
Kirito
402700801_19_a
That's a unique monster.
NPC
402700801_18_a
Hrrmmm...
NPC
402700801_17_a
The Samurai Soul, eh?
NPC
402700801_16_a
Um... We'd like to know about
the Samurai Soul monster.
Kirito
402700801_15_a
You're right.
Asuna
402700801_14_a
Well, we already know the answer,
but it seems a shame to come all
this way and not ask...
Kirito
402700801_13_a
Spit it out. I don't have all day.
Which monster do you wish
to learn about?
NPC
402700801_12_a
I see... A rare character in more
ways than one.
Asuna
402700801_11_a
I guess that means you always have
to go looking for him if you want
to ask about another monster...
Kirito
402700801_10_a
Seems like his story is he's some
sorta famous sojournin' sorcerer.
Argo
402700801_9_a
But why is he all the way out
here? There's no one and nothing
around...
Asuna
402700801_8_a
If ya tell him the monster's
name, he'll tell ya if it's
unique or not.
Argo
402700801_7_a
Looks like it.
Argo
402700801_6_a
This old man's the one?
Kirito
402700801_5_a
Asuna
402700801_4_a
Argo
402700801_3_a
Kirito
402700801_2_a
bg_04_forest_sunset
I see you wish to ask me
about a certain monster...
NPC
402700801_1_a
Yep. I wanna see fer myself if
that info is good or not.
Argo
402700701_29_a
You'd come with us?
Kirito
402700701_28_a
Apparently that NPC's just arrived
in this area. Wanna go check
it out?
Argo
402700701_27_a
Seems like there's this NPC who'll
tell ya. All ya gotta do is tell
'em the monster's name.
Argo
402700701_26_a
Kirito
402700701_25_a
So, Argo, how do we tell if a
monster is unique or not?
Asuna
402700701_24_a
Nahaha! Ya know me well!
Argo
402700701_23_a
Eh... Honestly I'm just scared
you'd spread nasty rumors about me
if I stiffed you on the bill...
Kirito
402700701_22_a
Heh, very mature of ya, Kii-boy.
Mutual trust is the foundation of
healthy business relationships.
Argo
402700701_21_a
We did ask you to look. What kind
of thankless customers would we
be if we didn't pay?
Kirito
402700701_20_a
I mean, we'll still buy whatever
you found out.
Kirito
402700701_19_a
Welp, I guess ya don't need
my info after all.
Argo
402700701_18_a
Ha ha, exactly.
Kirito
402700701_17_a
And the suspense is gettin'
poor Asu down.
Argo
402700701_16_a
Aah, that explains it. Since ya
ran inta him a second time, he
could appear a third or a fourth...
Argo
402700701_15_a
He's a renegade...
A ghost-type.
Kirito
402700701_14_a
Hehe, Asuna's been like this ever
since we figured that out.
Kirito
402700701_13_a
sigh
Asuna
402700701_12_a
so we know he's not unique.
There are probably a million of
those guys wandering around.
Kirito
402700701_11_a
The monster we were wondering
about showed up again last night,
Kirito
402700701_10_a
Say what?
Argo
402700701_9_a
We did, but...
We don't need to anymore.
Kirito
402700701_8_a
So ya wanted ta know how ta tell
if a mob's unique or not, yeah?
Argo
402700701_7_a
No worries. I'm happy ta meet
payin' customers anywhere they
need me ta be.
Argo
402700701_6_a
...
Asuna
402700701_5_a
Thanks for coming all the way
here, Argo.
Kirito
402700701_4_a
Asuna
402700701_3_a
Kirito
402700701_2_a
bg_02_fountain
Heeey, Kii-boy! Asu!
Over here!
Argo
402700701_1_a
Guess we've got some research
to do.
Kirito
402700601_26_a
But how do we figure out if it's
a unique monster or not...?
Kirito
402700601_25_a
No, I think you just want to
double- and triple-check that this
is settled since it's scary.
Kirito
402700601_24_a
Well, yeah... Maybe I'm just being
paranoid...
Asuna
402700601_23_a
So you're saying you want to make
sure we won't run into him again.
Kirito
402700601_22_a
I was just thinking
it'd be nice if it was just
one unique monster...
Asuna
402700601_21_a
What is it?
Kirito
402700601_20_a
Y-You think so?
But...
Ugh...
Asuna
402700601_19_a
Hopefully. But unlike bosses,
there are probably multiple
"renegade" monsters...
Kirito
402700601_18_a
Aaanyway, we beat him. Hopefully
this will put those renegade
rumors to rest.
Asuna
402700601_17_a
I-I knew that...
Ehehe...
Asuna
402700601_16_a
Um... No, "soul" as in "spirit"...
Kirito
402700601_15_a
A sole samurai? As in, the last
samurai? That's kind of
cool, I guess...
Asuna
402700601_14_a
Did you see his name when we were
fighting? It said "Samurai Soul."
Kirito
402700601_13_a
Wh-Who knows...?
Asuna
402700601_12_a
I wonder if that was the monster
Agil told us about...
Kirito
402700601_11_a
And it looks like he's been
weakened if just the two of
us can take him...
Kirito
402700601_10_a
Yeah. He got a bit of a make-over,
but that was definitely the
Floor 10 boss.
Asuna
402700601_9_a
It's okay. You can't help it if
you're scared of ghosts.
But that guy...
Kirito
402700601_8_a
Kirito... I'm sorry.
I wasn't much help...
Asuna
402700601_7_a
Disappearing in a puff of white
smoke? I'll say...
Kirito
402700601_6_a
I'm not sure... That was kind of
an odd effect...
Asuna
402700601_5_a
Did we beat him...?
Kirito
402700601_4_a
Asuna
402700601_3_a
Kirito
402700601_2_a
bg_06_graveyard_dawn
RRRAAAAAAGGHHHH!!
???
402700601_1_a
GRAAAAUUUUHHHH!!
???
402700501_36_a
That's him!
Kirito
402700501_35_a
Kagachi the Samurai Lord!
Asuna
402700501_34_a
The samurai, remember?
What was he called again...?
Kirito
402700501_33_a
What?!
Asuna
402700501_32_a
It's the boss from Floor 10!
Kirito
402700501_31_a
I know I've seen this "ghost"
somewhere before... Oh!
Kirito
402700501_30_a
H-Huh?
Asuna
402700501_29_a
No... Wait, Asuna!
Kirito
402700501_28_a
G-G-GHOOOOOOOOST!!
Asuna
402700501_27_a
It can't be-!
Kirito
402700501_26_a
Wha-huh-?
N-No way!
Kirito
402700501_25_a
Graaaaaaahhh!
???
402700501_24_a
R-Renegaaaade!!
Asuna
402700501_23_a
Aaaauuuughhh...
???
402700501_22_a
What the-?!
Kirito
402700501_21_a
I-It's the...!
Asuna
402700501_20_a
Asuna? What's wrong?
Kirito
402700501_19_a
K-K...Kirito-!
Asuna
402700501_18_a
I guess there's no point hashing
it over anymore, anyway. Agil
did say it was a fake...
Kirito
402700501_17_a
...!
Asuna
402700501_16_a
Ah, right. Sorry...
Kirito
402700501_15_a
I'd rather forget all the scary
stuff that's happened to me there!
Asuna
402700501_14_a
J-Just stop talking about that,
would you?! You're giving me
the creeps!
Asuna
402700501_13_a
Let's see. There's the Enchanted,
the Astral...
Can't forget the Living Dead...
Kirito
402700501_12_a
Yeah... Speaking of which,
the ruins on Floor 5 are
full of those kinds of mobs, huh?
Kirito
402700501_11_a
Like an honest-to-goodness
phantom...
Asuna
402700501_10_a
Still, it's scary, considering it
appears without any warning
whatsoever...
Asuna
402700501_9_a
not some official party we
formed or anything...
Kirito
402700501_8_a
but how would it even make that
list? The Assault Team's just a
name we made up,
Kirito
402700501_7_a
A renegade monster targeting the
Assault Team... I guess we'd
be on its hit list,
Kirito
402700501_6_a
Well...just a little...
Asuna
402700501_5_a
Asuna... You're not still thinking
about what Agil said, are you?
Kirito
402700501_4_a
...
Asuna
402700501_3_a
Asuna
402700501_2_a
bg_06_graveyard
...
Kirito
402700501_1_a
Well, see you around. You two
watch your backs, alright?
Agil
402700402_23_a
Thanks, Agil.
Kirito
402700402_22_a
I'll be sure to get in touch if I
find out anything else.
Agil
402700402_21_a
That's pretty much all anyone
knows about it right now.
Agil
402700402_20_a
A renegade, huh?
Kirito
402700402_19_a
people have taken to calling it
the renegade.
Agil
402700402_18_a
Apparently just like a samurai.
But since there's no pattern to
when or where it spawns,
Agil
402700402_17_a
What's that mob look like, anyway?
Kirito
402700402_16_a
N-No, I'm f-fine...
Asuna
402700402_15_a
Yeah. Sorry, I know you hate
scary stories.
Agil
402700402_14_a
Y-You mean it's...a...g-ghost?
Asuna
402700402_13_a
It's like it's some sort of
phantom...
Agil
402700402_12_a
Even in places where only weak
mobs are supposed to spawn.
Agil
402700402_11_a
That's the thing... No one knows.
No one can ID it since it shows up
at any place, at any time.
Agil
402700402_10_a
What monster?
Kirito
402700402_9_a
There's been this monster spawning
out of nowhere and attacking
Assault Team members.
Agil
402700402_8_a
What are you talking about, Agil?
Kirito
402700402_7_a
You think so? Considering what's
going on...
Agil
402700402_6_a
I'm glad this is going smoothly.
Asuna
402700402_5_a
Yeah, we've just about reached
this floor's boss.
Kirito
402700402_4_a
Asuna
402700402_3_a
Kirito
402700402_2_a
bg_06_graveyard
Well, I guess that's enough for today.
Agil
402700402_1_a
We would find out soon enough...
Asuna
402700401_30_a
such as Floor 10 or 20, were
designed to give us even more
grief than we first thought.
Asuna
402700401_29_a
We did, for all intents and
purposes. But we didn't know
that bosses on border floors
Asuna
402700401_28_a
Liz
402700401_27_a
But you beat him, didn't you?
Silica
402700401_26_a
Yeah...
Asuna
402700401_25_a
Silica
402700401_24_a
Asuna
402700401_23_a
bg_os_cafe
So the boss on Floor 10 was
a samurai?
Liz
402700401_22_a
...
Asuna
402700401_21_a
O-Okay, fine...
Asuna
402700401_20_a
How about we just activate
the teleporter on the next floor?
Kirito
402700401_19_a
B-But...!
Asuna
402700401_18_a
It's fine, Asuna. Just leave it.
Kirito
402700401_17_a
Hey, you!
Asuna
402700401_16_a
...
Asuna
402700401_15_a
This sucks...
Player
402700401_14_a
What the hell! I can't believe
he nabbed the last attack
AGAIN...
Player
402700401_13_a
Bosses on border floors really
can't be dealt with like
ordinary ones...
Kirito
402700401_12_a
Yeah... That sword of his was
lightning quick, and his armor
was hard to get through...

We defeated Floor 10's boss,
Kagachi the Samurai Lord...
Man, he was tough...
Asuna
402700401_10_a
Asuna
402700401_9_a
bg_09_dungeon_boss_defeat
Phew...
We did it...
Kirito
402700401_8_a
GHHAAAAHHHHHHH!!
Kagachi the Samurai Lord
402700401_7_a
HAAAAAAAAHHHH!!
Kirito
402700401_6_a
Now...
Let's finish this!
Kirito
402700401_5_a
Ngghhh!
Kagachi the Samurai Lord
402700401_4_a
Yeah!
Hyaaaah!!
Asuna
402700401_3_a
Asuna
402700401_2_a
bg_09_dungeon_boss
Now, Asuna!
Switch!
Kirito
402700401_1_a
Well...
Asuna
402700301_30_a
Yeah? Which one was it?
Liz
402700301_29_a
Yeah. There's this one boss
monster that really sticks out
in my memory...
Asuna
402700301_28_a
Did something come to mind
about it?
Silica
402700301_27_a
But back to that samurai...
Asuna
402700301_26_a
Hahaha, yeah... Alright,
I'll do it.
Asuna
402700301_25_a
since even at school he's always
messing around with some machine,
right?
Liz
402700301_24_a
Maybe you should even try asking
him to play again. He hasn't been
exercising enough at all,
Liz
402700301_23_a
Maybe I should ask Kirito.
Asuna
402700301_22_a
The rumor's spreading exactly
because there's no proof...
Silica
402700301_21_a
No, not that I've been able to
find.
Silica
402700301_20_a
I feel like there were a lot of
samurai-type enemies... Is there
a picture of it or anything?
Asuna
402700301_19_a
Hmmm... A samurai?
Liz
402700301_18_a
a monster from that SAO death
game. Any survivors out there
who can verify?"
Liz
402700301_17_a
"Everyone's saying the samurai
boss mob that showed up in
Akihabara yesterday looks like
Liz
402700301_16_a
Let's see what it says...
Liz
402700301_15_a
Yeah, I remember talking about
that before.
Asuna
402700301_14_a
They're discussing the new boss
that showed up the other day, the
one that looks like it's from SAO.
Silica
402700301_13_a
Asuna
402700301_12_a
Yeah?
Liz
402700301_11_a
There's a thread that caught
my eye...
Silica
402700301_10_a
Um... Well, I've been looking
at the message boards...
Silica
402700301_9_a
You've been sneaking peeks at your
OS HoloWindow for a while...
Asuna
402700301_8_a
Is something wrong, Silica?
Asuna
402700301_7_a
...
Silica
402700301_6_a
Hahaha, we can thank OS for that.
Asuna
402700301_5_a
And it's even tastier
because it's free!
Liz
402700301_4_a
Silica
402700301_3_a
Asuna
402700301_2_a
bg_os_cafe
The cake at this cafe is seriously
de-LISH!
Liz
402700301_1_a
I see...
Liz
402700201_25_a
Every time I ask him about it, he
changes the subject...
Asuna
402700201_24_a
Maybe...
Asuna
402700201_23_a
There has to be some reason he
doesn't want to play.
Liz
402700201_22_a
He said he tried it once,
but hasn't touched it again since.
Asuna
402700201_21_a
Silica
402700201_20_a
But I thought he was playing...
Liz
402700201_19_a
Yeah... But AR's not really his
thing, so he politely declines
every time I invite him to play.
Asuna
402700201_18_a
Kirito...
Silica
402700201_17_a
You mean...
Liz
402700201_16_a
Hehe, right... And there's someone
whose expertise in that area
outranks us all...
Asuna
402700201_15_a
and making judgments
based on that knowledge.
Right?
Liz
402700201_14_a
Yeah, basically understanding the
game's underlying mechanics,
Liz
402700201_13_a
Oh, you mean the things besides
physical ability that matter
if you want to win this game?
Silica
402700201_12_a
What you were talking about
earlier. I think I figured out
what you meant.
Liz
402700201_11_a
Huh? What's "it," Liz?
Asuna
402700201_10_a
Yeah, for sure.
So that's it...
Liz
402700201_9_a
There are a lot of skills you have
to sharpen, like learning to
read enemy AI.
Asuna
402700201_8_a
Otherwise it'll end up like just
now, with a monster giving you a
harder time than it should.
Asuna
402700201_7_a
You really have to have a good
grasp of your surroundings to
play OS successfully.
Asuna
402700201_6_a
Ha ha... Yeah, when it cornered us
against that building, I thought
we'd lost for sure...
Silica
402700201_5_a
Yeah. I'm glad we won,
but I thought we were in trouble
for a second there...
Asuna
402700201_4_a
Silica
402700201_3_a
Asuna
402700201_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Ooh, we got some pretty rare
materials from this one!
Liz
402700201_1_a
Yeah!
Silica
402700101_34_a
Alright, then let's go!
Asuna
402700101_33_a
I bet you're right!
Silica
402700101_32_a
I bet we'll get lots of points
for taking that thing down!
Liz
402700101_31_a
Grwaaaaaaaah!
Monster
402700101_30_a
Over there!
Liz
402700101_29_a
Silica
402700101_28_a
What is it, Liz?
Asuna
402700101_27_a
Oh!
Liz
402700101_26_a
...
Liz
402700101_25_a
Oh, it's nothing. Never mind...
Asuna
402700101_24_a
What are you talking about?
Liz
402700101_23_a
Um, Asuna...?
Silica
402700101_22_a
...
Asuna
402700101_21_a
Yeah... Still, that can't be the
only thing that matters when
it comes to winning...
Asuna
402700101_20_a
It's pretty much made for athletic
types like Leafa.
Liz
402700101_19_a
Yeah. You can't do any of the
crazy, superhuman stuff you can do
in VR either.
Liz
402700101_18_a
is pretty much the same
as playing any other sports.
Asuna
402700101_17_a
Augmented reality is still
reality, after all. Using your own
body to play the game
Asuna
402700101_16_a
Well, there are some marked
differences between it and VR.
Asuna
402700101_15_a
Or at least that's what she said.
Silica
402700101_14_a
Ordinal Scale's augmented reality
would be the perfect chance to
show off her kendo skills...
Silica
402700101_13_a
Asuna
402700101_12_a
Liz
402700101_11_a
Yes, but she seemed pretty
down about it.
Silica
402700101_10_a
She's at some sort of training
camp right now and everything.
Asuna
402700101_9_a
Yeah... It sounds like she's been
pretty busy with kendo.
Asuna
402700101_8_a
since Leafa hasn't been around
much lately.
Liz
402700101_7_a
Yeah... We've really been hurting
for a main attacker too,
Liz
402700101_6_a
It feels good to finally
have gotten this far!
Asuna
402700101_5_a
Yes! We finally got ten points for
those cafe tickets!
Silica
402700101_4_a
Asuna
402700101_3_a
Silica
402700101_2_a
bg_os_town_1
We did it!
Liz
402700101_1_a
Ahaha!
Alicia
402601201_47_a
Hehehe...
Sakuya
402601201_46_a
B-Back me up here, guys!
Kirito
402601201_45_a
See? You won't even tell me!
You're up to something!
Leafa
402601201_44_a
W-Well... Um...
Kirito
402601201_43_a
So what WERE you talking about?
Leafa
402601201_42_a
I-It's not like that, Leafa!
And you two! Don't put
ideas into her head!
Kirito
402601201_41_a
I knew it!
Leafa
402601201_40_a
Nahaha...
Alicia
402601201_39_a
Hehe...
Sakuya
402601201_38_a
Ooh, I bet they were trying to
reel him in for some twisted
scheme again.
Leafa
402601201_37_a
What were the three of you talking
about, all huddled together
like this?
Sinon
402601201_36_a
Kirito
402601201_35_a
Alicia
402601201_34_a
Hey, look who's here!
Leafa
402601201_33_a
That would be much appreciated.
Sakuya
402601201_32_a
Sure, I'd be happy to help out
whenever I have the time.
Kirito
402601201_31_a
That's a fantastic idea.
Sakuya
402601201_30_a
Maybe we should have Kirito come
be the advisor for all of our
joint events!
Alicia
402601201_29_a
You're right!
Alicia
402601201_28_a
We have a lot of room for
improvement if our roles were
so easily usurped by you.
Sakuya
402601201_27_a
Well, the two of us were meant
to be advisors to each team's
leader.
Sakuya
402601201_26_a
Y-You're giving me way too
much credit...
Kirito
402601201_25_a
Then I suppose we owe you our
gratitude for helping make this
event a big success.
Sakuya
402601201_24_a
I see. Well, in any case, that did
give us a pretty exciting finish
to the battle.
Alicia
402601201_23_a
I just wanted to help them see
they still had a chance, to help
Sinon see she could do it...
Kirito
402601201_22_a
But I felt bad for the ogres...
They looked like they were at
their wit's end...
Kirito
402601201_21_a
O-Of course not... The thought
never crossed my mind...
Kirito
402601201_20_a
So you didn't stop by with the
intention to counsel your dear
friends Leafa and Sinon?
Sakuya
402601201_19_a
Ehehe... Once I heard about what
you were doing, I just had to come
see for myself...
Kirito
402601201_18_a
I knew it! It's written all over
your face!
Alicia
402601201_17_a
gulp
...
Kirito
402601201_16_a
That was a lie, wasn't it?
Sakuya
402601201_15_a
You know how you said you just
"happened to be in the
neighborhood" for the battle?
Alicia
402601201_14_a
So what do you want?
Kirito
402601201_13_a
sigh
...
Kirito
402601201_12_a
Hehe, then I suppose we'll just
stay right here.
Sakuya
402601201_11_a
I don't want to get in trouble
with the harassment code!
Kirito
402601201_10_a
H-Hey, don't get so close to me!
Kirito
402601201_9_a
Only if you'd be interested in
something like that.
Sakuya
402601201_8_a
Maaaybe!
Alicia
402601201_7_a
Don't tell me you're still trying
to enlist me as a mercenary...
Kirito
402601201_6_a
Wh-What is with you two?
Kirito
402601201_5_a
Hehe, Kiritooo...
Sakuya
402601201_4_a
Sakuya
402601201_3_a
Kirito
402601201_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
Heeey, Kiritoooo!
Alicia
402601201_1_a
Well, if you insist,
I'd be happy to.
Kirito
402601101_26_a
Yeah! It's no problem,
so come on!
Alicia
402601101_25_a
If you discount giving the teams
advice, then Alicia and I didn't
do anything either.
Sakuya
402601101_24_a
Are you sure? I didn't really
do anything...
Kirito
402601101_23_a
You should come too, Kirito!
Alicia
402601101_22_a
For sure! Come on, we've got an
after-party to go to! Time to eat,
drink, and be merry!
Alicia
402601101_21_a
Kirito's involvement did add a
bit of extra excitement to our
battle, in the end.
Sakuya
402601101_20_a
Hehe, all's well that ends well,
right, Leafa?
Sakuya
402601101_19_a
Besides, I gave both of you the
best advice I could! It's not like
I played favorites!
Kirito
402601101_18_a
I'm still utterly humiliated!
Leafa
402601101_17_a
H-Hey, come on... It was a great
fight. Isn't that enough...?
Kirito
402601101_16_a
If you hadn't said anything to
Sinon, she never would have gotten
past our Paint Arrows!
Leafa
402601101_15_a
This is all your fault!
Leafa
402601101_14_a
Kiritoooo!
Leafa
402601101_13_a
Leafa
402601101_12_a
Sinon
402601101_11_a
Hey, you two. That was one
heck of a duel.
Kirito
402601101_10_a
Hehe, that makes me happy
to hear...
Leafa
402601101_9_a
Reminds me of fighting Kirito
in BoB...
Sinon
402601101_8_a
Yeah. It was a good fight.
Sinon
402601101_7_a
But I'll take my loss... It was
pretty awesome fighting you
on equal footing, Sinon...
Leafa
402601101_6_a
Grrr... That was humiliating...
Leafa
402601101_5_a
I did it... I defeated the humans'
leader!
Sinon
402601101_4_a
Hnngh...!
Leafa
402601101_3_a
Leafa
402601101_2_a
bg_event_remains
I won...!
Sinon
402601101_1_a
If it's a fight you want,
it's a fight you'll get!
Sinon
402601001_18_a
Get ready, Sinon!
Leafa
402601001_17_a
then I want to do it my way!
Leafa
402601001_16_a
I know. If we're going to fight
face-to-face like this,
Leafa
402601001_15_a
Those Paint Arrows won't work
against me anymore.
Sinon
402601001_14_a
Hehe, you're pretty calm.
That's the right call, you know.
Sinon
402601001_13_a
We have to take her down
head-on!
Leafa
402601001_12_a
No, it's useless to try to fight
her like that.
Leafa
402601001_11_a
Leafa, let us use our Paint
Arrows! We can hit her from
this distance!
Human Team Member
402601001_10_a
Wearing this wasn't exactly my
idea...
Sinon
402601001_9_a
Nice of you to wear that to make
it obvious. Okay, I confess. I'm
the leader.
Leafa
402601001_8_a
Hehe, no point in hiding it now.
And obviously you're THEIR leader.
Leafa
402601001_7_a
Leafa... I knew they'd choose you
to be their leader.
Sinon
402601001_6_a
Sinon
402601001_5_a
I have to say, I'm impressed
you got this far, Sinon.
Leafa
402601001_4_a
...!
Sinon
402601001_3_a
Sinon, over there!
Ogre Team Member
402601001_2_a
bg_event_remains
Phew... We finally made it into
the belly of the beast.
Sinon
402601001_1_a
A full-frontal attack, huh...
Okay...
Leafa
402600901_32_a
The only thing you can do is close
in on her and take her out in
hand-to-hand combat.
Kirito
402600901_31_a
There's no one on your team that
comes even close to matching
Sinon's range.
Kirito
402600901_30_a
I think maybe you should stop
relying on those Paint Arrows.
Kirito
402600901_29_a
Um... Okay...
Kirito
402600901_28_a
Ahaha, this would be a great time
for you to say something helpful.
Alicia
402600901_27_a
I-Is that it...?
Kirito
402600901_26_a
No, you idiot! You gave Sinon
advice, so it's only fair you give
me some too!
Leafa
402600901_25_a
Why do you have your hand out
like that? Are you asking me to
shake it...?
Kirito
402600901_24_a
Alright, Kirito! Out with it!
Leafa
402600901_23_a
Grrr, it must be nice to be
so laid-back all the time...
Leafa
402600901_22_a
Well, I may be this team's
advisor, but I don't care who wins
as long as it's fun!
Alicia
402600901_21_a
Ahaha... Right...
Alicia
402600901_20_a
The ogre team's right on our
doorstep and getting ready to
break down the door!
Leafa
402600901_19_a
You can be impressed
with her later, Alicia!
Leafa
402600901_18_a
Then that must have been enough
to give Sinon the hint she needed.
How clever...
Alicia
402600901_17_a
That's all I said!
Kirito
402600901_16_a
that she could probably read where
players without particularly high
archery skill levels were aiming...
Kirito
402600901_15_a
I really didn't do anything...
I just said I thought Sinon was
a good enough archer
Kirito
402600901_14_a
So why did you just glance away?!
You can't hide your facial
expressions in VR, so don't lie!
Leafa
402600901_13_a
Huh?! I-I didn't do anything...
Kirito
402600901_12_a
What did you do?! What did you
say to Sinon when you stopped by
the ogre camp earlier?!
Leafa
402600901_11_a
Grrr... Kazu
I mean, Kirito!
Leafa
402600901_10_a
Hehe...
Kirito
402600901_9_a
Silica must have fallen
to Sinon...
Alicia
402600901_8_a
Uh-oh... That's not good.
Alicia
402600901_7_a
Wh-What?!
Leafa
402600901_6_a
Th-They even got Silica...!
Human Team Member
402600901_5_a
Kirito
402600901_4_a
Alicia
402600901_3_a
Leafa
402600901_2_a
bg_event_remains
The ogres took out everyone
stationed at the entrance!
Human Team Member
402600901_1_a
It's our turn next, guys!
Sinon
402600801_31_a
Hehe, archers aren't much use in
close-quarters combat.
I should know...
Sinon
402600801_30_a
Th-This isn't happening!
Silica
402600801_29_a
Let's get 'em!
Ogre Team Member
402600801_28_a
Yeaaaaaah! Alright, time for some
good ol' fashioned fisticuffs!
Ogre Team Member
402600801_27_a
It doesn't matter how many volleys
you fire! I'll knock every last
arrow out of the sky!
Sinon
402600801_26_a
O-One more time, everyone!
Ready... Fire!
Silica
402600801_25_a
Way to go, Sinon! Everyone,
now's our chance! Keep going!
Ogre Team Member
402600801_24_a
Sinon
402600801_23_a
I-Impossible!
Silica
402600801_22_a
And shooting them down with mine!
Sinon
402600801_21_a
A play right out of Kirito's
handbook... Estimating the path
of your arrows...
Sinon
402600801_20_a
Hehe, didn't expect that, did you?
Sinon
402600801_19_a
Wha
Silica
402600801_18_a
Not on my watch!
Sinon
402600801_17_a
...!
Sinon
402600801_16_a
Fine, then! Everyone!
Nock your Arrows and
prepare to fire!
Silica
402600801_15_a
That ready to end this, are you?
Silica
402600801_14_a
YEAAAAAAAAHH!
Ogre Team Member
402600801_13_a
Let's GO!
Ogre Team Member
402600801_12_a
Alright, everyone.
CHAAAARGE!
Sinon
402600801_11_a
Okay.
Sinon
402600801_10_a
Sinon! Everything's ready!
Ogre Team Member
402600801_9_a
Hehe, are you sure about that?
Sinon
402600801_8_a
You shouldn't have poked
the hornet's nest!
Silica
402600801_7_a
We all have our Paint Arrows
nocked and ready!
Silica
402600801_6_a
So here we are again, Sinon...
I won't lose this time!
Silica
402600801_5_a
Silica...
Sinon
402600801_4_a
We can take them out in one fell
swoop if we all fire our Arrows
at the same time!
Silica
402600801_3_a
The ogre team's gathering
over there!
Silica
402600801_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
Oh! Look!
Silica
402600801_1_a
Hehe... Don't underestimate
them...
Kirito
402600701_31_a
Right!
Silica
402600701_30_a
We just gotta keep doing what
we've been doing, everyone!
Leafa
402600701_29_a
There's nothing they can do as
long as we have our Paint Arrows.
Leafa
402600701_28_a
Ugh, fine... We don't need spies,
anyway.
Leafa
402600701_27_a
I-I suppose you're right...
Silica
402600701_26_a
It's not like I'm spying for
either side. I'm just observing.
Kirito
402600701_25_a
Ah... You know I can't say.
Kirito
402600701_24_a
S-So what was going on with
Sinon and everyone?!
Leafa
402600701_23_a
Nahaha, you really do go wherever
the wind blows you.
Alicia
402600701_22_a
I already stopped by the ogre
camp.
Kirito
402600701_21_a
so I came by to check it out
since I was in the neighborhood.
Kirito
402600701_20_a
Well, I heard the Sylphs and Cait
Siths were doing something fun
together,
Kirito
402600701_19_a
Wh-What are you doing here?!
Silica
402600701_18_a
Hey. Looks like things are
going well.
Kirito
402600701_17_a
Silica
402600701_16_a
Kirito
402600701_15_a
Who's there?!
Kazu
I mean, Kirito?!
Leafa
402600701_14_a
Huh, so you did choose Sugu
mean, Leafa for your leader.
???
402600701_13_a
Even if I am the leader...
Leafa
402600701_12_a
I still don't feel right just
sitting on my butt here the
whole time...
Leafa
402600701_11_a
I bet they're trying to figure out
a strategy to cope with them
right now.
Alicia
402600701_10_a
The other side is definitely
feeling wary of our Paint Arrows.
Alicia
402600701_9_a
I'm glad you made it back
safe and sound, Silica.
Alicia
402600701_8_a
Hahaha, sorry...
Leafa
402600701_7_a
but Sinon nearly got me!
Silica
402600701_6_a
We may be doing better overall,
Silica
402600701_5_a
Grrr, Leafaaaa!
Silica
402600701_4_a
Alicia
402600701_3_a
Silica
402600701_2_a
bg_event_remains
Hahaha! Things couldn't be going
more perfectly!
Leafa
402600701_1_a
...!
Sinon
402600601_45_a
I get wanting to win quickly, but
maybe stop thinking only about
going after the players themselves.
Kirito
402600601_44_a
Huh? What're you talking about?!
Sinon
402600601_43_a
Well, it'd be a tall order...
But actually, I think you could.
Kirito
402600601_42_a
I can't take ALL of them out
on my own.
Sinon
402600601_41_a
But everyone on the human team
has those arrows.
Sinon
402600601_40_a
I did that earlier and managed to
take out Silica...
Sinon
402600601_39_a
Can't you scout ahead and take
out those paint archers?
Kirito
402600601_38_a
But you're an ace sniper, Sinon.
Kirito
402600601_37_a
Yeah.
Sinon
402600601_36_a
Ah, okay. That does make things
difficult.
Kirito
402600601_35_a
It's basically the fantasy version
of a paint gun.
Sakuya
402600601_34_a
Huh... What kind of weapon?
Kirito
402600601_33_a
The rules are that if you get hit
by it even once, you're out.
Sinon
402600601_32_a
Not good... The other team has a
special weapon that's giving us
trouble.
Sinon
402600601_31_a
Thanks. So, how're things going?
Kirito
402600601_30_a
If that's what you wish,
Lady Sakuya...
Sylph
402600601_29_a
I think we can let him stay,
if all he wants to do is watch.
Sakuya
402600601_28_a
Oh, leave him be. He's a friend.
Sakuya
402600601_27_a
Hurry up and leave already,
Spriggan!
Sylph
402600601_26_a
Hng...! N-None of your business!
And quit eyeballing me!
Sinon
402600601_25_a
Hey, Sinon, what's that fun
get-up you're wearing?
Kirito
402600601_24_a
You stick your nose into
literally everything, don't you?
Sinon
402600601_23_a
I was just passing by and thought
you'd at least let me hang out
as an observer or something.
Kirito
402600601_22_a
It just looked too fun not to
come check it out.
Kirito
402600601_21_a
Yeah, I know I'm not supposed
to be here, sorry.
Kirito
402600601_20_a
As you can see, we're in the
middle of a joint Sylph-Cait Sith
Setsubun Battle.
Sakuya
402600601_19_a
K-Kirito?! What are you doing
here?
Sinon
402600601_18_a
Sakuya
402600601_17_a
Sinon
402600601_16_a
Hey guys!
Kirito
402600601_15_a
Quite the commotion at our camp's
entrance...
Sakuya
402600601_14_a
What's going on?
Sinon
402600601_13_a
Hey, who the heck are you?! Only
Sylph and Cait Sith players are
allowed here!
Sylph
402600601_12_a
We just have to figure out what
to do about those Paint Arrows...
Sinon
402600601_11_a
Don't worry, I've got a lot of
fight left in me.
Sinon
402600601_10_a
The battle's only just begun.
Sakuya
402600601_9_a
Don't lose hope yet, Sinon.
Sakuya
402600601_8_a
At this rate, not a single ogre
will be able to get close to the
ruins, let alone inside them.
Sinon
402600601_7_a
They're the ones with the
advantage, not us...
Sinon
402600601_6_a
Unfortunately. Those Paint Arrows
are pretty accurate.
Sinon
402600601_5_a
And we've already sustained a
number of losses, including
Recon...
Sakuya
402600601_4_a
Yeah, that's why we came back.
We have to organize ourselves
better.
Sinon
402600601_3_a
Sinon
402600601_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
So they've got archers stationed
all around the entrance...
Sakuya
402600601_1_a
Recon
402600501_34_a
Heh, you're welcome to try.
Sinon
402600501_33_a
You win for now, Sinon,
but I'll get you next time!
Silica
402600501_32_a
Uwaaah... I've barely got half
my HP left...
Silica
402600501_31_a
Recon
402600501_30_a
There isn't a player alive who's
better at archery than I am!
Sinon
402600501_29_a
Recon
402600501_28_a
Hehe, how'd you like that?
Sinon
402600501_27_a
Yikes!
Waaah!
Silica
402600501_26_a
Sinon
402600501_25_a
Whoa, she's fast!
Recon
402600501_24_a
Hyaaah!
Sinon
402600501_23_a
You're sadly mistaken!
Sinon
402600501_22_a
Recon
402600501_21_a
Silica, if you think you're any
match for me at this distance...
Sinon
402600501_20_a
My next shot won't miss!
Silica
402600501_19_a
What...?
N-No way...
Recon
402600501_18_a
You didn't need to fling yourself
in front of that arrow... It was
easy for me to dodge...
Sinon
402600501_17_a
Aaah! What are you doing, Recon?!
Sinon
402600501_16_a
Hngyaaaah!
Recon
402600501_15_a
Silica
402600501_14_a
Sinon
402600501_13_a
Sinon, watch out!
Recon
402600501_12_a
Tch...!
Sinon
402600501_11_a
So take THIS!
Silica
402600501_10_a
That outfit has to mean they chose
you to be their leader!
Silica
402600501_9_a
Grrrr!
Sinon
402600501_8_a
Hehe, you look so cute!
Silica
402600501_7_a
Silica...!
Sinon
402600501_6_a
Hi, Sinon!
Silica
402600501_5_a
Huh?!
Sinon
402600501_4_a
Recon
402600501_3_a
Sinon
402600501_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
Found you!
???
402600501_1_a
Okay!
Recon
402600401_22_a
They're sure to launch a volley
of Paint Arrows at us now!
Sinon
402600401_21_a
Be careful, everyone!
Sinon
402600401_20_a
Sinon, I can see the ruins!
Sylph
402600401_19_a
I know you will!
Recon
402600401_18_a
But I am your leader, so I'll do
everything I can to lead us
to victory.
Sinon
402600401_17_a
Am I, though? I haven't played
ALO for very long...
Sinon
402600401_16_a
And we chose you because you were
the best suited, so maybe they had
the same thought process...
Recon
402600401_15_a
But they don't seem like the kind
of people who would pull a trick
like that.
Sinon
402600401_14_a
I'm sure it's possible they
chose someone else just to throw
us off...
Sinon
402600401_13_a
Being cute has nothing to do with
anything. She's simply the most
qualified for the position.
Sinon
402600401_12_a
I bet you're right! She's so
strong and cute and...
Recon
402600401_11_a
I bet you my best bow they chose
Leafa.
Sinon
402600401_10_a
Oh, I meant to ask... Who do you
think the human leader is?
Recon
402600401_9_a
I'll be fine. I can take care of
myself.
Sinon
402600401_8_a
You too, Sinon. They'll be aiming
at you for sure.
Recon
402600401_7_a
The ruins are just ahead, but be
careful. We're well within range
of those arrows already.
Sinon
402600401_6_a
Y-Yeah...
Recon
402600401_5_a
Here we go...
Sinon
402600401_4_a
Recon
402600401_3_a
Sinon
402600401_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
I'm pleased to inform you that
the joint Sylph-Cait Sith Setsubun
battle will now begin!
Announcer
402600401_1_a
Do us ogres proud, you two.
Sakuya
402600301_37_a
Ugh, fine... Let's just start
already.
Sinon
402600301_36_a
Sh-She's right!
I think so too!
Recon
402600301_35_a
Everyone agreed that we couldn't
have chosen a more capable leader
than you, Sinon.
Sakuya
402600301_34_a
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.
Sakuya
402600301_33_a
Wear it yourself, if you get such
a big kick out of it...
Sinon
402600301_32_a
Your sense of humor is so warped,
both of you...
Sinon
402600301_31_a
Alicia and I broke out into
giggles when we finished it.
It was just so adorable.
Sakuya
402600301_30_a
We designed it ourselves and had
the devs make it especially for
this event.
Sakuya
402600301_29_a
Ha ha, exactly.
Sakuya
402600301_28_a
So that's why our leader has to
wear this special costume...
Recon
402600301_27_a
We discussed this problem of
fairness, and this is the solution
we arrived at.
Sakuya
402600301_26_a
But the ogres can't do anything
similar to make it just as obvious
who THEIR leader is.
Sakuya
402600301_25_a
It's quite possible the humans
will hide their leader deep within
the ruins to protect them, right?
Sakuya
402600301_24_a
You might as well have painted
a target on my back!
Sinon
402600301_23_a
I understand having the leaders
wear a special uniform...
But this...
Sinon
402600301_22_a
Hahaha, but it looks so good on
you, Sinon!
Sakuya
402600301_21_a
sigh
... I would like it on the
record I did NOT agree to this.
Sinon
402600301_20_a
...appear...
Recon
402600301_19_a
Sinon, where did you run off
to? You're our leader, you can't
just...dis...
Recon
402600301_18_a
Sakuya
402600301_17_a
Recon
402600301_16_a
...
Sinon
402600301_15_a
Oh... Speaking of which, I think
I see our Lord Ogre now...
Sakuya
402600301_14_a
I see...
Recon
402600301_13_a
but we can at least act as
advisors to our respective teams.
Sakuya
402600301_12_a
Yes. Of course, the lords can't
actually participate in battle,
Sakuya
402600301_11_a
Oh, okay... Um, Lady Sakuya,
are you an ogre too?
Recon
402600301_10_a
Hehe, never you mind.
You'll find out when you
see her again.
Sakuya
402600301_9_a
Huh? What is it?
Recon
402600301_8_a
So then...
Sakuya
402600301_7_a
Well, she was selected to be the
ogre leader, wasn't she?
Sakuya
402600301_6_a
Oh, Lady Sakuya! Did you see
where Sinon went?
Recon
402600301_5_a
Recon
402600301_4_a
What's the matter, Recon?
Sakuya
402600301_3_a
Huh?
She was just here a minute ago...
Recon
402600301_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
Sinon! Heeey, Sinon!
Recon
402600301_1_a
Now you can start discussing
strategy with your teams.
Sakuya
402600201_31_a
Alright, that's pretty much it!
Alicia
402600201_30_a
but we have to really be careful
not to get hit by even one
of those Paint Arrows.
Sinon
402600201_29_a
Okay, I get it. At first glance,
the ogres seem to have the
advantage,
Sinon
402600201_28_a
but considering this is a
player-organized event, we weren't
able to work it out.
Sakuya
402600201_27_a
Originally we wanted to get some
sort of bean-shooting weapon for
you,
Sakuya
402600201_26_a
This is the best we could do.
Sakuya
402600201_25_a
What?!
Silica
402600201_24_a
Any ogre who gets hit by this
arrow has to immediately lie down
and play dead.
Alicia
402600201_23_a
Yes, but of course we cannot get
guns in ALO, so this will have
to do instead.
Sakuya
402600201_22_a
Just like what happens when you
get shot by a paintball gun.
Alicia
402600201_21_a
It deals no damage, but it does
dye whatever it strikes a very
vibrant shade.
Sakuya
402600201_20_a
That is one colorful arrow...
Sinon
402600201_19_a
item_event_paint_arrow
This.
Sakuya
402600201_18_a
That's why we've prepared a
special item for the human team.
Sakuya
402600201_17_a
Hmmm... That puts the human team
at a disadvantage right off the
bat...
Silica
402600201_16_a
The humans cannot leave the ruins.
They will stay there and protect
their leader from the ogres.
Sakuya
402600201_15_a
Then what do the humans do?
Leafa
402600201_14_a
It's basically that old adage of
"Ogres out, luck in."
Sakuya
402600201_13_a
The ogre team will try to
infiltrate that base and attack
the human leader.
Sakuya
402600201_12_a
The human team will be based
inside the ruins in Sylph
territory.
Sakuya
402600201_11_a
There are also a few special
rules just for this event.
Sakuya
402600201_10_a
Of course, we don't want anyone
losing ALL their HP, so please be
careful not to take it that far.
Alicia
402600201_9_a
Each team decides a leader. If you
decrease the other leader's HP
to a certain point, you win!
Alicia
402600201_8_a
Alright, humans over there, ogres
over here. We're going to explain
the rules.
Alicia
402600201_7_a
Same here.
Sinon
402600201_6_a
G-Gaaah...
I'm on the ogre team...
Recon
402600201_5_a
Me too!
Silica
402600201_4_a
Sakuya
402600201_3_a
Silica
402600201_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Ooh, I'm on the human team!
Leafa
402600201_1_a
Now then, let's divide up the
teams.
Sakuya
402600101_15_a
I-I just hope I'm on the same
team as you, Leafa!
Recon
402600101_14_a
This is gonna be a blast. I can't
wait to find out what team I'm on!
Leafa
402600101_13_a
You're right!
Silica
402600101_12_a
Today is all about having fun!
We should focus on all the fun
Setsubun stuff we're going to do!
Alicia
402600101_11_a
Let's save the chit-chat for later,
okay, Silica?
Alicia
402600101_10_a
I suppose... But I don't think it
will have much of an effect on
the fighting between guilds...
Silica
402600101_9_a
Nahaha, true. Just think of this
as further strengthening the bonds
between us.
Alicia
402600101_8_a
Like our races aren't already the
two that get along the best in
ALO...
Sinon
402600101_7_a
Though you may have fought one
another in the past, today is all
about interracial cooperation.
Sakuya
402600101_6_a
You will all be randomly assigned
to the ogre team or the human
team.
Sakuya
402600101_5_a
The joint Sylph-Cait Sith Setsubun
Battle will begin shortly.
Sakuya
402600101_4_a
Sakuya

402502201_32_a
えっ、もう?
アスナ
402502201_31_a
はい……
さて休憩もこれくらいにして、
練習を再開しますね
プレミア
402502201_30_a
プレミア……
その気持ちもまた、ヒトに近づいてる
って証拠だと思うぞ
キリト
402502201_29_a
もっと速く……もっと高く……
飛んでみたいと、強く思うように
なりました
プレミア
402502201_28_a
やっぱり空を自由に動ける感覚は
思い描いていたとおり
とても気持ちが良いものでした
プレミア
402502201_27_a
……まだ少ししか
飛べてはいませんが
プレミア
402502201_26_a
その本を読んでる限り浮遊術は
体内のエネルギーみたいなものを
うまく操作することみたいだし
アスナ
402502201_25_a
そうだね……わたしたちの飛び方は
翅を身体の一部に見立てるから
アクション性が強いものだけど
アスナ
402502201_24_a
教えてやることもできないのが
なんとももどかしいぜ
キリト
402502201_23_a
しっかし翅の飛行と
女神の浮遊術とでは
飛び方が結構違うんだな
キリト
402502201_22_a
は、はい
プレミア
402502201_21_a
焦らないでじっくり自分のペースで
やっていこうよ
アスナ
402502201_20_a
そうだね、わたしたちも
飛ぶときはかなり練習する必要が
あったから……
アスナ
402502201_19_a
今落ちた衝撃でＨＰも
少し減ってるだろ?
キリト
402502201_18_a
プレミア
やる気があるのは良いけど
ペースも考えたほうがいい
キリト
402502201_17_a
できるまで続けますから……
プレミア
402502201_16_a
はい……
でもまだ負けませんよ
プレミア
402502201_15_a
でもいい線行ってたと思うよ!
アスナ
402502201_14_a
プレミア
402502201_13_a
アスナ
402502201_12_a
ああ、あと少しだったのにな……
キリト
402502201_11_a
bg_18_mountain
痛っ!
プレミア
402502201_10_a
アスナ
402502201_9_a
キリト
402502201_8_a
そ、そんなこと言われても……
も、もう限界で……
きゃああっ!
プレミア
402502201_7_a
プレミアちゃん!
体勢を崩さないで!
アスナ
402502201_6_a
はっ、はい……
えと、ここで重心を身体の中心に……
きゃあっ!
プレミア
402502201_5_a
プレミア!
その調子だ!
キリト
402502201_4_a
アスナ
402502201_3_a
キリト
402502201_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
わっ、わわっ……!
プレミア
402502201_1_a
キリトやアスナのように……!
プレミア
402502101_31_a
わたし今日からこれを何度も読んで
早く飛べるようになりますね
プレミア
402502101_30_a
大事なステップ……
わかりました
プレミア
402502101_29_a
ああ、これもまたヒトに近づくための
大事なステップってやつかもな
キリト
402502101_28_a
ううん、そんなことないよ
ただ自由に飛べるようになるには
勉強する必要があるってことかな
アスナ
402502101_27_a
えと……要するに……
わたしはまだ飛べないという
ことなんですか?
プレミア
402502101_26_a
最終的に随意飛行ができるように
なるまで、けっこう時間かかるからな
キリト
402502101_25_a
なるほどな……翅の飛行でも
最初は補助ありから始まって
キリト
402502101_24_a
これを読んだからといって
すぐに身に付くものではないようです
402502101_23_a
浮遊術のほうも
会得するための手順に
いくつか段階があるようですね
402502101_22_a
はい……翅を使った
感覚を意識する飛行方法とは
異なるようですが、
402502101_21_a
一朝一夕とはいかなそうだね……
アスナ
402502101_20_a
これって……
確かに浮遊術の方法が書いてある
んだけど……
アスナ
402502101_19_a
どれどれ……
キリト
402502101_18_a
あはは、主張しすぎてる
誇大文句のせいで、
逆に不安になるって意味だね
アスナ
402502101_17_a
胡散臭い……?
プレミア
402502101_16_a
な、なんだそれ……
胡散臭くないか?
キリト
402502101_15_a
「これであなたもすぐ飛べる!
四週間で学ぶ浮遊術最強プログラム」
アスナ
402502101_14_a
item_event_book_of_magic
ええと……
本のタイトルが……
アスナ
402502101_13_a
これですね……
プレミア
402502101_12_a
はい……
プレミア
402502101_11_a
とりあえず魔導書を読んでみようぜ
そこにあるトレジャーボックスに
入ってるはずだ
キリト
402502101_10_a
これでわたしは空を飛ぶことが
できるように……
プレミア
402502101_9_a
キリト、アスナ、ユイ……
本当にありがとうございます
プレミア
402502101_8_a
うん、おめでとう
プレミアちゃん!
アスナ
402502101_7_a
やった……やりました!
プレミア
402502101_6_a
見事なり……
我が魔導書を読む権利を……
キサマらに与えよう……
魔導士
402502101_5_a
bg_s2_16_dungeon_door
倒したか!?
キリト
402502101_4_a
アスナ
402502101_3_a
プレミア
402502101_2_a
はい!
任せてください!
プレミア
402502001_26_a
スマンがフォロー頼む!
キリト
402502001_25_a
プレミア!
この敵はアスナがちょっと
苦手なタイプだ!
キリト
402502001_24_a
なるほど
発案者自らが力試しを
してくれるってことか!
キリト
402502001_23_a
この身を以って確かめてやろう……!
魔導士
402502001_22_a
キサマらが我が編み出した浮遊術を
会得するにふさわしいか否か……
魔導士
402502001_21_a
わぁぁん!
こんなの聞いてないよぉ!
アスナ
402502001_20_a
ママ、こういうときは
幽霊と言ったほうが的確かと!
402502001_19_a
だが魔導士は既に死んでいるはず……
キリト
402502001_18_a
えっ?
あの人はもしかして魔導書を遺した
っていう魔導士!?
アスナ
402502001_17_a
グオオオッ……!
キサマら、我が魔導書が目的で
来た者か……!?
???
402502001_16_a
この声は……!?
アスナ
402502001_15_a
グオオオッ……!
???
402502001_14_a
はは……あいつの惚れっぽさが
こんなところで役立つとは……
キリト
402502001_13_a
「いやがうえにも気合いが入るって
もんだぜ!」と凄んでいたのを
思い出しました!
プレミア
402502001_12_a
はい!
SA:Oのときにクラインが
女の子を助けるクエストで
プレミア
402502001_11_a
プレミアさん、難しい言葉を
よく知ってますね!
402502001_10_a
いやがうえにも気合いも入ります!
プレミア
402502001_9_a
はい、ここで魔導書を
手に入れられたらわたしも
空を飛べるかもしれないんです
プレミア
402502001_8_a
おお、プレミア
なんだか気合い入ってるな
キリト
402502001_7_a
はい!
プレミア
402502001_6_a
気をつけよう
この規模のクエストだから
ダンジョンボスがいるかもしれない
アスナ
402502001_5_a
ということは
そこが魔導士の隠れ家か
キリト
402502001_4_a
アスナ
402502001_3_a
キリト
402502001_2_a
bg_s2_16_dungeon_door
マップによると
この先が終点……最深部ですね
402502001_1_a
お、俺はなにもしてませんよ……
キリト
402501901_27_a
キリトくーん
なにしてるのかな～?
アスナ
402501901_26_a
おわっ!
ちょ、ちょっとプレミア!
いきなり体当たりは止めてくれ!
キリト
402501901_25_a
わたしにも
《ぴったり》させて下さい!
プレミア
402501901_24_a
ユイだけキリトに
《ぴったり》してズルいです!
プレミア
402501901_23_a
うん、あっちは行き止まりだった
なにも無かったよ
アスナ
402501901_22_a
お……二人とも戻ってきたのか
キリト
402501901_21_a
402501901_20_a
あっ!
プレミア
402501901_19_a
パパ、ありがとうございます……
402501901_18_a
それは誰よりも人間的な感情だって
俺は思ってるよ
キリト
402501901_17_a
キミの一番の望みは家族として、
俺たちとずっと一緒にいること
キリト
402501901_16_a
ユイ……
俺とアスナはわかってるつもりだよ
キリト
402501901_15_a
あのように個人的な
望みを口にすることは
なかなかありません……
402501901_14_a
わたし自身もNPCの中では
高いAIを持ってはいますが……
402501901_13_a
だよな
キリト
402501901_12_a
SA:Oにいたころの彼女には
とても見られなかった光景ですね
402501901_11_a
先ほどの飛ぶことの憧れ……
あれは空想や夢に想いを馳せるという
とても人間らしい姿だと思います
402501901_10_a
パパも思いましたか
わたしもそう感じていました
402501901_9_a
なんか前よりも更に
人間らしい感じになってる気が
しないか
キリト
402501901_8_a
なあ、ユイ……
プレミアなんだけど……
キリト
402501901_7_a
そうですか
402501901_6_a
手分けして探索中だ
今あっちのほうを見に行って
もらってる
キリト
402501901_5_a
ママとプレミアさんは
どこに行ったのでしょう?
402501901_4_a
ユイ、どうした?
キリト
402501901_3_a
キリト
402501901_2_a
bg_s2_16_dungeon
402501901_1_a
プレミアちゃん……
アスナ
402501801_24_a
わたしが感じ始めたこの憧れも……
わたしがヒトに近づいているという
ことなのでしょうか……
プレミア
402501801_23_a
だからこそALOの飛行には……
俺たちは得も言われぬ魅力を
感じているのかもしれないな
キリト
402501801_22_a
でも現実だと自力で飛べない……
たとえどれだけ科学が進歩してもだ
キリト
402501801_21_a
ああ……現実世界の俺たちも
空を飛びたいと思う人は多いよ
キリト
402501801_20_a
それとも翼を持ち鳥のように
大空を舞うことに憧れを感じている
のか……
プレミア
402501801_19_a
単純にキリトたちと肩を並べて
戦いたいからだけなのか……
プレミア
402501801_18_a
でもその感情がどこから来るのか
わからずにいます
プレミア
402501801_17_a
このALOを旅するうちに
確かに空を飛んでみたいと……
思うようになりました
プレミア
402501801_16_a
プレミアちゃん……
アスナ
402501801_15_a
キリトたちが暮らすもう一つの世界の
ヒトは……空を飛ぶことを
羨ましいと思うんですか?
プレミア
402501801_14_a
えっ?
キリト
402501801_13_a
ヒトは……
プレミア
402501801_12_a
ふふっ、そうだね
アスナ
402501801_11_a
はは、もしそうだったら、
今度は俺たちがプレミアを羨ましい
って見上げる番かもな
キリト
402501801_10_a
つまりわたしが浮遊術を会得できれば
ここでも飛べるようになるということ
でしょうか……?
プレミア
402501801_9_a
ですがあの大きな女性……
ウルズはこの世界でも飛んでいました
プレミア
402501801_8_a
だから光の届かない地下世界や
洞窟みたいな閉ざされた空間では
地上を歩くしかないんだ
キリト
402501801_7_a
ああ、妖精の翅は太陽の光を力に
変えて羽ばたくことができるんだ
キリト
402501801_6_a
ヨツンヘイム全体もそうですが、
洞窟の中も基本的には
飛行することはできないんですね
プレミア
402501801_5_a
キリト
402501801_4_a
プレミア
402501801_3_a
キリト
402501801_2_a
bg_s2_16_dungeon
ここが例の洞窟だね
アスナ
402501801_1_a
はい!
プレミア
402501701_24_a
そうみたいだな
よし、プレミア
早速行ってみようぜ
キリト
402501701_23_a
他のプレイヤーには
教えちゃダメってことだね
アスナ
402501701_22_a
他言無用であること、
ゆめゆめ忘れぬよう……
ウルズ
402501701_21_a
我々は浮遊術を会得する器の者にのみ
この事実を教え、継承してきました
ウルズ
402501701_20_a
そこに魔導士が遺したとされる
聖櫃の中に魔導書が眠っている
はずです
ウルズ
402501701_19_a
ヨツンヘイムの最北端の
渓谷に高名な魔導士が隠れ住んだ
とされる洞窟があります
ウルズ
402501701_18_a
ああ、助かる
キリト
402501701_17_a
では教えましょう
浮遊術の魔導書への試練の道を……
ウルズ
402501701_16_a
妖精の戦士よ……
そなたたちは今また困難な道へと
進むというのですね
ウルズ
402501701_15_a
ウルズさん
魔導書を手に入れる方法を
教えてくれますか?
アスナ
402501701_14_a
魔導書……!
なんだかクエストっぽく
なってきたな
キリト
402501701_13_a
女神のみが使える浮遊術のことが
記された魔導書を手に入れる
必要があるからです
ウルズ
402501701_12_a
ですがそれを会得するのは
並大抵のことではありません
ウルズ
402501701_11_a
は、はい……!
プレミア
402501701_10_a
やったね!
プレミアちゃん!
アスナ
402501701_9_a
おっ!
キリト
402501701_8_a
それは……確かにあります
ウルズ
402501701_7_a
だからなにか特別な能力でも
あるんじゃないかって思ったんだ
キリト
402501701_6_a
ああ、アンタたちは俺たちのような
翅もないのに飛べるだろう?
キリト
402501701_5_a
プレミア
402501701_4_a
アスナ
402501701_3_a
キリト
402501701_2_a
bg_11_road_to_coral
我々にだけ使える……
飛行する術……
ですか?
ウルズ
402501701_1_a
うん!
アスナ
402501601_29_a
ヨツンヘイムに向かい、
ウルズに話を聞いてみよう!
キリト
402501601_28_a
そうだな
よし、キーワードは女神だ!
キリト
402501601_27_a
わたしたちも
できることはなんでもしないとね!
アスナ
402501601_26_a
ふふっ、せっかくプレミアちゃんが
ALOに興味を持ってくれて
飛びたいって言ってくれてるんだから
アスナ
402501601_25_a
プレミア……
キリト
402501601_24_a
わたしにとても優しくしてくれます
……そのことがなんだか、
とても嬉しいんです
プレミア
402501601_23_a
いつでも前向きで
諦めたりしない……
それでいて……
プレミア
402501601_22_a
二人とも……変わりませんね
あの世界にいたときとまったく……
プレミア
402501601_21_a
どうしたの、プレミアちゃん
アスナ
402501601_20_a
………………
プレミア
402501601_19_a
ああ!
キリト
402501601_18_a
そ、そんなことがあるんですか?
プレミア
402501601_17_a
新しい女神だけの
飛行術が生まれてるかもしれない
ってことだよね
アスナ
402501601_16_a
つまりプレミアちゃんが
この世界に来たことで
アスナ
402501601_15_a
それがこの世界の基幹プログラムの
すごいところなんだ
キリト
402501601_14_a
辻褄を合わせて新しい要素や
クエストを作り出すこともできる……
キリト
402501601_13_a
たとえ後付けだとしても
プレミアという存在が
このALOに現れたことにより、
キリト
402501601_12_a
まぁ言っても理解できないかも
しれないけどな
キリト
402501601_11_a
……?
プレミア
402501601_10_a
ふふっ、そういう都合を
うまく取り繕うのもカーディナルの
真骨頂なんだぜ
キリト
402501601_9_a
そんな都合よく行くでしょうか……?
プレミア
402501601_8_a
わたしがあの世界で与えられた
女神という役割は別のもののように
思います……
プレミア
402501601_7_a
どうでしょうか?
否定したいわけではありませんけど
この世界の女神という存在と
プレミア
402501601_6_a
ああ!
キリト
402501601_5_a
なるほど
その可能性はあるかもしれないね
アスナ
402501601_4_a
キリト
402501601_3_a
アスナ
402501601_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
女神だけに使える飛行術……
ですか
プレミア
402501601_1_a
ああ……!
キリト
402501501_29_a
なるほど……
調べてみる価値はあるかも
しれませんね!
402501501_28_a
女神とか神格化されたキャラには
翅とは別の飛行する術を持っている、
とかそういう設定があるんじゃないか
キリト
402501501_27_a
ウルズもプレミアも女神という
設定を持つキャラクター……
キリト
402501501_26_a
あっ、そう言えば……
402501501_25_a
あの人さ、飛行不可能な
ヨツンヘイムで宙に浮いてたよな?
キリト
402501501_24_a
ええと、検索をかけてみます……
はい、確かにウルズさんは
女神ということになっています
402501501_23_a
そうそう!
ヨツンヘイムの丘の巨人族の!
キリト
402501501_22_a
ウルズさん……ああ
あのエクスキャリバーを巡る
クエストに登場された方ですね
402501501_21_a
丘の巨人族の女王ウルズって……
確か北欧神話だと
運命の女神だったよな!?
キリト
402501501_20_a
は、はい……
402501501_19_a
今プレミアは
女神だったって言ってたよな……?
キリト
402501501_18_a
えっ、パパ
どうかしましたか?
402501501_17_a
女神……!?
キリト
402501501_16_a
ん……?
キリト
402501501_15_a
そうだよなぁ……
キリト
402501501_14_a
後天的に翅を持たせることは
難しいのではないかと思います
402501501_13_a
セブンさんが言っていたように
妖精への調整がなされず
コンバートされた以上は、
402501501_12_a
プレミアさんはSA:Oでは
アインクラッド設定との適合化により
世界の《女神》という扱いでした
402501501_11_a
そうですね……
402501501_10_a
一応《翅》ってものがALOにおいて
大事な飛行可能な要素だからな
キリト
402501501_9_a
……そうだ
けど今のところ
そういうのは無さそうだな
キリト
402501501_8_a
ではプレミアさんが飛べるように
なる方法を探しているんですね?
402501501_7_a
ああ……
なんかさ、プレミアが
ちょっと可哀想で……
キリト
402501501_6_a
先ほどからALOの情報サイトや
攻略記事を色々と見ていますね
402501501_5_a
えっ……あっ、ユイか
キリト
402501501_4_a
パパ、なにか調べものですか?
402501501_3_a
402501501_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
………………
キリト
402501501_1_a
………………
キリト
402501401_29_a
キリトやアスナを見ていると
飛べない自分がもどかしくなります
プレミア
402501401_28_a
ですがALOではやはり
すべてにおいて飛行ありきなので
プレミア
402501401_27_a
はい……最初は飛ぶことに
それほど興味はありませんでした
プレミア
402501401_26_a
でもプレミアちゃん……
やっぱり飛びたいよね
アスナ
402501401_25_a
それくらいはわかります
プレミア
402501401_24_a
プレミアもヒトの感情の機微が
わかってきたみたいだな……
キリト
402501401_23_a
えっ……あ、あはは……
そういうことかぁ……
アスナ
402501401_22_a
わたしはあくまで
飛ぶアクションを羨ましいと
思っただけです
プレミア
402501401_21_a
アスナ……
なにか勘違いしていませんか?
プレミア
402501401_20_a
えっ!?
アスナ
402501401_19_a
いえ……キリトが
空を飛びながら戦うのは
格好いいなと……
プレミア
402501401_18_a
どうした、プレミア
なんだか元気がないみたいだけど
キリト
402501401_17_a
はい……
プレミア
402501401_16_a
うん、プレミアちゃんもお疲れさま
アスナ

よし、倒したぞ!

プレミア

うん!
アスナ
402501401_7_a
任せろ!
俺が仕留める!
二人は地上の残りを頼む!
キリト
402501401_6_a
あっ!
モンスターが空に逃げた!

グギギッ!
モンスター
402501401_1_a
この際仕方ないか……
キリト
402501301_21_a
それはALOを十分楽しめたことに
ならないから、なんかもったいない
気もするけど……
アスナ
402501301_20_a
わたしは別に飛べなくても
構いませんが……
プレミア
402501301_19_a
だよね……
セブン
402501301_18_a
それだとこの世界に呼んだ意味が
そもそもなくなっちゃうぞ……
キリト
402501301_17_a
最悪メンテ後ってことも
ありえるかも……
セブン
402501301_16_a
一度プレミアのアバターの元データを
立ち上げ直さなきゃいけないから
ちょっと面倒かもしれない……
セブン
402501301_15_a
うーん、不可能じゃないと思うけど、
今ってSA:Oのほうが
メンテ中でしょ?
セブン
402501301_14_a
コンバートをやり直すことは
できないの?
アスナ
402501301_13_a
ストレアとかはNPCなのに、
ALOで土妖精ノームとして
生まれ変わったからな
キリト
402501301_12_a
アバターが基本的にSA:Oの時と
同じまま再現されちゃったの
セブン
402501301_11_a
正確には妖精の種族を
割り当てなかったせいで
セブン
402501301_10_a
要するにコンバートの際の
調整ミスによりわたしには
翅がないということなんですね?
プレミア
402501301_9_a
あの……
プレミア
402501301_8_a
ちゃんと設定し直さなきゃ
ダメだったんだね
セブン
402501301_7_a
そっか……その辺は
自動でどうにかなるかと思ってたけど
セブン
402501301_6_a
コンバートできただけ
十分すぎるくらいだからね
アスナ
402501301_5_a
まぁ仕方ないよ

あっ!!
アスナ

もしかして飛べないんじゃ……
キリト
402501201_39_a
プレミアって……
コンバートしてきた割りには
翅がないけど……
キリト
402501201_38_a
どうしたの、キリトくん
アスナ
402501201_37_a
あれっ……?

うん、妖精と魔法……
そして翅で空を飛ぶことができる
VRMMO……
アスナ
402501201_33_a
それはそうと……
ここがキリトたちが今生きている
世界なんですね
プレミア
402501201_32_a
俺で遊ぶの間違いじゃ……
キリト
402501201_31_a
はい、久しぶりに
キリトと遊んで楽しかったです
プレミア
402501201_30_a
えー、コホン
それくらいでいいかな……
プレミアちゃん
アスナ
402501201_29_a
も、もちろんだよ……
キリト
402501201_28_a
むぅ……キリトは
本当にわたしとの再会が
嬉しいんですか?
プレミア
402501201_27_a
目のやり場に困るというか……
見つめ合うことになっちゃうから……
キリト
402501201_26_a
えっ!?
そ、そりゃあ……そうやって
ジッと見つめられると……
キリト
402501201_25_a
ならどうして今
目を逸らしたんですか?
プレミア
402501201_24_a
………………
アスナ
402501201_23_a
お、おう……
キリト
402501201_22_a
キリト、わたしと再会できて
嬉しいですか?
プレミア
402501201_21_a
そうだね
アスナ
402501201_20_a
そうだったのか
今度なにかお礼をしなきゃな
キリト
402501201_19_a
セブンには感謝しています
ここに来るまでの様々な手続きを
すべてこなしてくれました
プレミア
402501201_18_a
なんだか嵐のように去っていったね
セブンちゃん……

ダスヴィダーニァ～!
セブン
402501201_14_a
それは安心だな、助かったぜ
キリト
402501201_13_a
この世界でのプレミアはちゃんと
死に戻りができるから安心してね!
そういう風に設定直しておいたから!
セブン
402501201_12_a
……戻ってきた!
キリト
402501201_11_a
そうそう、大事なこと言い忘れてた!
セブン
402501201_10_a
あっ……
キリト
402501201_9_a
天才科学者は色々と忙しいの!
んじゃ二人ともプレミアのことは
ヨロシクね!

お、おいおい!
もう行くのかよ!
キリト
402501201_7_a
よしよし
無事にコンバートできて良かったわ
じゃああたしはこれで!
セブン
402501201_6_a

ノンノン、焦らないの!
フフフッ……セブンちゃんの手に
かかれば造作もないことよ!

例の件なんだけど……

セブンちゃん?
アスナ

キーリートーくーん!
???
402501101_20_a
そうだね……
アスナ
402501101_19_a
同じザ・シードネクサス規格だから
不可能じゃないはずなんだが……
キリト
402501101_18_a
別のVRMMOにプレミアを
コンバートできないか、
聞いてもらってるんだ
キリト
402501101_17_a
SA:Oが稼働停止してる間、
キリト
402501101_16_a
でもさ、セブンちゃんを通じて
いま頼んでるんだよね
アスナ
402501101_15_a
でもその間アイツは……
どうしてるんだろうって
考えてたんだ
キリト
402501101_14_a
SA:Oが長期メンテに
入ったことは仕方ないと思う……
キリト
402501101_13_a
試験運用とはいえあれだけの
騒ぎになっちまったからな
キリト
402501101_12_a
はは、アスナには敵わないな
ああ……そのとおりだよ
キリト
402501101_11_a
……!
キリト
402501101_10_a
プレミアちゃんのことかな?
アスナ
402501101_9_a
当たらずとも遠からずってトコかな
もしくは……
アスナ
402501101_8_a
えっ?
キリト
402501101_7_a
SA:Oのように
アインクラッドが落ちてこないかって
考えてるとか?
アスナ
402501101_6_a
ふふっ、キミの考えてることなんて
お見通しなんだからね
アスナ
402501101_5_a
アスナ……
いや……なんでもない
キリト
402501101_4_a
キリトくん
どうしたの、そんな風に
アインクラッドを見つめて

キリト

You too!
Asuna
402202301_25_a
Likewise, Asuna.
Take care of yourself.
Rechka
402202301_24_a
Well, I'm glad that we got to meet
again and that I'll get to see you
even more in ALO!
Asuna
402202301_23_a
That's what he would have wanted.
Rechka
402202301_22_a
You're not wrong. But I also felt
it was time to move on.
Rechka
402202301_21_a
Well, I wouldn't have put it quite
so, uh, bluntly...
Asuna
402202301_20_a
What? That I'm still trying to
connect with my dead husband?
Rechka
402202301_19_a
Oh, okay. I thought for sure
you'd... Never mind, it's not
important.
Asuna
402202301_18_a
Mostly because I'd heard it was
the easiest for SAO survivors to
adapt to.
Rechka
402202301_17_a
So I came to see what I could see
in this land of the fairies.
Rechka
402202301_16_a
I wanted to see more of the
virtual world you and your husband
enjoy so much.
Rechka
402202301_15_a
I wasn't talking about cooking
when I said I knew you'd make it.
Rechka
402202301_14_a
You've always been a great cook.
Rechka
402202301_13_a
Ha ha, no no, I never intended to
train you as a chef or anything
like that.
Rechka
402202301_12_a
Wait... You came back to see how
I was doing since you'd taken
me under your wing?
Asuna
402202301_11_a
I'm very proud of you, Asuna.
Rechka
402202301_10_a
You did? Just now?
Asuna
402202301_9_a
I just did.
Rechka
402202301_8_a
So, will you tell me why you've
come to ALO?
Asuna
402202301_7_a
I always knew you'd make it.
Rechka
402202301_6_a
But, more importantly, you never
stopped practicing.
Rechka
402202301_5_a
You've really buffed your stats
and learned a lot since coming
to ALO.
Rechka
402202301_4_a
Thank you, Rechka.
Asuna
402202301_3_a
Asuna
402202301_2_a
bg_event_alo_arena
I concede defeat.
That was something else.
Rechka
402202301_1_a
Good idea!
Kirito
402202201_23_a
Let's get close to the stage so we
can congratulate her!
Liz
402202201_22_a
That's our Asuna! Woohoo!
Leafa
402202201_21_a
YES! Asuna won!
Kirito
402202201_20_a
Asuna the Undine!
402202201_19_a
A course so good you'd swear you
were at a Japanese restaurant,
prepared by none other than...
402202201_18_a
...
402202201_17_a
And now, the moment you've all
been waiting for... The winner of
ALO's first Survival Cooking is...
402202201_16_a
Yeah, way to change the subject!
Leafa
402202201_15_a
Ooh, we'd better listen!
Kirito
402202201_14_a
That ought to do it for the
judges! I believe they have now
tasted everything on offer!
402202201_13_a
Are you calling me
Leafa
402202201_12_a
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk
to you about your eating habits...
Kirito
402202201_11_a
I don't usually feel that way,
though...
Leafa
402202201_10_a
Yeah, but your stomach still FEELS
like it's expanding, even if it's
not really.
Liz
402202201_9_a
At this point we'd be waiting for
the judges to digest so they
could continue judging.
Kirito
402202201_8_a
And yet it's STILL faster than
a real-life cooking competition
with this many entrants.
Kirito
402202201_7_a
Yeah, the least they could do is
give the audience a bite!
Leafa
402202201_6_a
Argh, this part always takes
forever!
Liz
402202201_5_a

The judges continue to eat their
way through the entries!
402202201_1_a
Heh. I'm looking forward to it!
Rechka
402202101_21_a
You showed me it wasn't impossible,
though, and now I'm going to show
you how much I've learned!
Asuna
402202101_20_a
Hehe, that was indeed the hardest
thing to recreate, given the
game's setting.
Rechka
402202101_19_a
I can still taste it...
Asuna
402202101_18_a
The soy sauce you taught me how to
make was the closest to the real
thing that I ever came, though.
Asuna
402202101_17_a
Yes. I experimented with a lot of
different things in SAO, trying to
recreate Japanese food.
Asuna
402202101_16_a
With THOSE ingredients?!
Rechka
402202101_15_a
Japanese food?!
Rechka
402202101_14_a
I'm making a traditional Japanese
meal.
Asuna
402202101_13_a
Heh, thank you.
So, what are you making?
Rechka
402202101_12_a
I'll have to stop by sometime.
Asuna
402202101_11_a
Ah, so you did open your
restaurant! Congratulations.
Asuna
402202101_10_a
Of course. My restaurant serves
Italian, after all.
Rechka
402202101_9_a
Italian... That explains why you
mentioned carpaccio.
Asuna
402202101_8_a
But if you must know, I'm going
to make an Italian course.
Rechka
402202101_7_a
Heh, don't judge a recipe by its
ingredient list.
Rechka
402202101_6_a
I'm beginning to think we might
be making the same thing...
Asuna
402202101_5_a
Let's see... Fishing, boar
hunting, mushroom picking, giant
egg collecting...
Asuna
402202101_4_a
Ha ha, I guess we hadn't seen the
last of each other after that
first encounter.
Asuna
402202101_3_a
Asuna
402202101_2_a
bg_event_alo_arena
So far, we're evenly-matched,
I'd say.
Rechka
402202101_1_a
GOOOO, ASUNAAAAA! WOO!
Leafa
402202001_16_a
It must be tough for Asuna,
though, going up against someone
she really respects.
Kirito
402202001_15_a
Mm-hm. It is a competition,
after all.
Kirito
402202001_14_a
I was watching them on the live
feed. They clashed a bunch while
they were gathering ingredients.
Liz
402202001_13_a
Ooh... And Rechka's not far
behind.
Liz
402202001_12_a
You're right!
Wait...
Kirito
402202001_11_a
Look! Asuna's back!
Leafa
402202001_10_a
They're just trying to make it
as interesting as they can.
Don't get too snarky.
Kirito
402202001_9_a
Thank you, Captain Obvious...
What's up with this MC?
Liz
402202001_8_a
but that's still plenty of time
to crank out a full course dinner
in VR!
402202001_7_a
There are just 30 minutes to go!
If this were the real world,
it'd be game-over for sure,
402202001_6_a
It looks like everyone's about to
start cooking!

heading back to the kitchen!
402202001_1_a
...
Asuna
402201901_39_a
Rechka! Wait!
Asuna
402201901_38_a
See you in the kitchen, Asuna.
Rechka
402201901_37_a
In fact, I've just thought of
another recipe.
Rechka
402201901_36_a
Heh, don't you underestimate me?
I've got more of a repertoire
than you.
Rechka
402201901_35_a
Are you sure about that?
Asuna
402201901_34_a
I'll find some other ingredients
to go collect.
Rechka
402201901_33_a
Right then, I'll leave this area
to you.
Rechka
402201901_32_a
Th-That's not true at all!
Asuna
402201901_31_a
Are you sure? I got the impression
that you were so hung up on me
that you couldn't focus.
Rechka
402201901_30_a
No more than I already had!
Asuna
402201901_29_a
What? Isn't that fair? Besides, it
will give you some much needed
motivation.
Rechka
402201901_28_a
Are you kidding me?
Asuna
402201901_27_a
Defeat me in this contest,
and I'll tell you.
Rechka
402201901_26_a
Hmm. How about this...?
Rechka
402201901_25_a
So why come back?
Asuna
402201901_24_a
Hehe, that's a fair point. I was
satisfied with simply cooking
in VR.
Rechka
402201901_23_a
I thought that would have been
enough.
Asuna
402201901_22_a
You told me you played SAO in
order to see some of what your
late husband had created.
Asuna
402201901_21_a
Am I not allowed to play another
VRMMO as long as I live?
Rechka
402201901_20_a
Hm?
Asuna
402201901_19_a
And?
Rechka
402201901_18_a
But all SAO survivors usually fear
returning, and rightly so.
Asuna
402201901_17_a
We're... We're different, I'll
grant you that.
Asuna
402201901_16_a
I could ask the same of you
and your husband.
Rechka
402201901_15_a
Why play another VRMMO?
Asuna
402201901_14_a
You made it out of SAO with
your life.
Asuna
402201901_13_a
What's that?
Rechka
402201901_12_a
Just tell me one thing, Rechka.
Asuna
402201901_11_a
Now, let's get back down
to business.
Rechka
402201901_10_a

Asuna
402201901_9_a
You'll see my true power once I've
collected my ingredients and
stepped into the kitchen!
Rechka
402201901_8_a
Cooking will always be my
first love.
Rechka
402201901_7_a
Yeah, hence my surprise.
Asuna
402201901_6_a
That was the first time we've ever
fought, wasn't it?
Rechka
402201901_5_a
And I regret pegging you as a
simple cook. You're not so bad
yourself!
Asuna
402201901_4_a
You've got some fight in you!
As I'd expect from a top member
of SAO's Assault Team.
Rechka

...
Asuna
402201901_1_a
Prepare to go down!
Asuna
402201801_13_a
Hehe, I like the sound of that!
Asuna
402201801_12_a
Why don't we give it a shot?
It can be our little reunion
battle.
Rechka
402201801_11_a
I don't much care for them, but if
that's what it takes to win
this...
Asuna
402201801_10_a
We could always fight for it.
Duels have been enabled.
Asuna
402201801_9_a
Oh, no? That's a shame. I suppose
it will turn into a mad dash
between the two of us, then.
Rechka
402201801_8_a
The problem is that they're so
rare! I don't have enough to
actually use yet.
Asuna
402201801_7_a
You can use these to season a
little carpaccio appetizer.
Delicious!
Rechka
402201801_6_a
So you've come to pick these herbs
too, have you?
Rechka
402201801_5_a
Rechka!
Asuna
402201801_4_a
Well, isn't this unexpected!
Rechka
402201801_3_a
I need to find more, though.
This won't be enough.
Asuna
402201801_2_a
bg_event_field
I should be able to use these
medicinal herbs as ingredients
too!
Asuna
402201801_1_a
Yeah!
Liz
402201701_24_a
Now let's go cheer her on,
because she needs our support!
Kirito
402201701_23_a
But here in VR, she's got the
stats and experience to see her
through!
Kirito
402201701_22_a
No high schooler has experience
making a full course dinner.
Sadly, Asuna's no exception.
Kirito
402201701_21_a
Do you think Asuna can handle
all that?
Liz
402201701_20_a
Hehehe...
Leafa
402201701_19_a
Are you feeling like you dodged
a bullet yet?
Kirito
402201701_18_a
They really want people to bring
their A-game for this one!
Leafa
402201701_17_a
As if the time limit weren't bad
enough, you have to be good at
cooking a ton of different stuff.
Leafa
402201701_16_a
Man, a full course dinner?
Leafa
402201701_15_a
Survival Cooking starts now!
Cook like your life depends
on it!
402201701_14_a
You will have three hours in which
to prepare your meals, and they
must be prepared here!
402201701_13_a
I guess not...
Liz
402201701_12_a
Geez, it's not just one dish?
Kirito
402201701_11_a
Take your guests on a culinary
journey that'll leave them in
a food coma!
402201701_10_a
Chinese, French, Italian
anything
goes!
402201701_9_a
The challenge before you is...
A full course dinner!
402201701_8_a
It appears that all contestants
are ready, so it's time to reveal
the challenge!
402201701_7_a
Yeah. This is exciting!
Leafa
402201701_6_a
Ooh, looks like it's about to
start.
Kirito
402201701_5_a

402201701_4_a
Leafa

bg_event_alo_arena
Attention, everyone! Thank you so
much for your patience!
???
402201701_1_a
Thanks, Leafa. I'll fight hard
enough for both of us!
Asuna
402201601_35_a
I'll be cheering for you, Asuna!
Er, no pressure, though!
Leafa
402201601_34_a
You're right. It won't be easy,
but I'm not backing down.
Asuna
402201601_33_a
You've been preparing for this
competition for a while now.
Liz
402201601_32_a
Don't worry, Asuna!
You've got this!
Liz
402201601_31_a
She'll be tough to beat.
Asuna
402201601_30_a
That she has. It looks like she
imported her SAO character too.
Stats and all.
Asuna
402201601_29_a
So she's started playing ALO too?
Kirito
402201601_28_a
Leafa
402201601_27_a
Kirito
402201601_26_a
...
Asuna
402201601_25_a
See you afterwards, then.
Rechka
402201601_24_a
Leafa
402201601_23_a
Kirito
402201601_22_a
Y-Yes, of course.
Asuna
402201601_21_a
and I need to do mine too.
You can introduce me to your
friends after the competition!
Rechka
402201601_20_a
But listen, I don't want to keep
you from your pre-competition
prep,
Rechka
402201601_19_a
You look good! And you have plenty
of friends in ALO, to boot.
That's fantastic.
Rechka
402201601_18_a
Leafa
402201601_17_a
Kirito
402201601_16_a
Oh, we do.
Asuna
402201601_15_a
I didn't know you guys knew
each other!
Leafa
402201601_14_a
So this is the master chef who
just started playing ALO!
Leafa
402201601_13_a
Asuna
402201601_12_a
Leafa
402201601_11_a
Kid? Klein's a full-grown man...
Physically, anyway...
Kirito
402201601_10_a
Hahaha! Yeah, I felt a little bad
for the kid, to be honest.
Rechka
402201601_9_a
Klein... Ah yes! The little
samurai guy!
Rechka
402201601_8_a
Leafa
402201601_7_a
Kirito
402201601_6_a
I just knew it had to be you!
Asuna
402201601_5_a
Klein was telling me about a
Salamander cook who really knows
her way around the kitchen.
Asuna
402201601_4_a
Leafa
402201601_3_a
Kirito
402201601_2_a
bg_event_alo_arena
It's been ages!
Asuna
402201601_1_a
Ha ha, from SAO, yes.
Rechka
402201501_28_a
Leafa
402201501_27_a
Asuna
402201501_26_a
Rechka, as in...THE Rechka?!
Kirito
402201501_25_a
Kirito
402201501_24_a
Leafa
402201501_23_a
Hi, Rechka!
Asuna
402201501_22_a
Long time no see! And your
husband's here too.
???
402201501_21_a
Kirito
402201501_20_a
Leafa
402201501_19_a
Eep!
Asuna
402201501_18_a
Is that you, Asuna?
???
402201501_17_a
Yeah, actually, I was. I'm loo
Asuna
402201501_16_a
Are you looking for someone?
Kirito
402201501_15_a
Hey, Asuna. I saw you looking
around a lot earlier.
Kirito
402201501_14_a
Oh, wow, I'm flattered!
Asuna
402201501_13_a
We both agreed we'd be better
off just cheering you on this
time!
Leafa
402201501_12_a
Yeah, well, I may or may not have
talked to Sakuya after we spoke.
Leafa
402201501_11_a
Wait, what? I thought you were the
Sylph entrant?
Asuna
402201501_10_a
I'm here to cheer you on too.
Leafa
402201501_9_a
Will do.
Asuna
402201501_8_a
Sure have. Show 'em what you're
made of, Asuna!
Liz
402201501_7_a
Yep!
Kirito
402201501_6_a
And the rest of you are here too!
Have you come to cheer us on?
Asuna
402201501_5_a
Hi Leafa.
Asuna
402201501_4_a
Kirito
402201501_3_a
Hey Asuna!
Leafa
402201501_2_a
bg_event_alo_arena
...
Asuna
402201501_1_a
How could I forget? It was...
Klein
402201401_24_a
Do you remember her name?
Asuna
402201401_23_a
Was that not obvious?
Klein
402201401_22_a
And this player was...a woman?
Asuna
402201401_21_a
Yeah, and I remember it like it
was yesterday. Punched me in the
gut all over again!
Klein
402201401_20_a
Ah. So you were recalling that
conversation?
Asuna
402201401_19_a
They said we could be friends, but
nothing more than that. Something
about a loved one they'd lost.
Klein
402201401_18_a
And...?
Asuna
402201401_17_a
It was so good, I just blurted out
"LET'S BE FRIENDS FOREVER!"
right then and there!
Klein
402201401_16_a
...
Asuna
402201401_15_a
Long story short, we stopped to
eat along the way, and this
player made some KILLER barbecue.
Klein
402201401_14_a
I ran into another Salamander
player while I was on that quest...
Klein
402201401_13_a
Well, there's a story behind that
frying pan. It was a quest reward.
Klein
402201401_12_a
Is everything okay?
That was quite the sigh.
Asuna
402201401_11_a
Whew...
Klein
402201401_10_a
Don't mention it!
Klein
402201401_9_a
Only Salamanders can get their
hands on these. Thank you! This
is a huge help.
Asuna
402201401_8_a
Yes, that's exactly the one!
Asuna
402201401_7_a
The one, the only, the Salamander-
made, ultra-durable, Fireproof
Frying Pan?
Klein
402201401_6_a
Was this the frying pain you were
lookin' for?
Klein
402201401_5_a
No, not at all.
Asuna
402201401_4_a
There you are, Asuna! Hope you
weren't waiting long!
Klein
402201401_3_a
Klein
402201401_2_a
bg_23_alne_terrace_sunset
Klein!
Asuna
402201401_1_a
One would hope...
Liz
402201301_31_a
That line of thinking has its own
tragic beauty, but I hope she's
trying to move on.
Asuna
402201301_30_a
So you think she's come to ALO to
continue mourning or something?
Liz
402201301_29_a
Right. She told me that he died
before SAO even launched.
Asuna
402201301_28_a
But that would mean that her
husband didn't die inside SAO.
Liz
402201301_27_a
So she started playing in order to
see what her husband had created.
Asuna
402201301_26_a
She told me that her husband
worked on the graphics for SAO
before he died.
Asuna
402201301_25_a
You're losing me.
What heavy stuff?
Liz
402201301_24_a
So if she's here, she's probably
still dealing with a lot of heavy
stuff.
Asuna
402201301_23_a
Of course I'd like to meet her,
but she had very specific
reasons for playing SAO.
Asuna
402201301_22_a
Uh, no, actually. I thought you'd
be excited to meet her...
Liz
402201301_21_a
I want to meet her, but I don't...
You know what I mean?
Asuna
402201301_20_a
I've never met her, but she must
really know her stuff if YOU'RE
worried about her.
Liz
402201301_19_a
Ah yeah, you mentioned something
about her being a master chef.
Liz
402201301_18_a
I think she might be Rechka
from SAO.
Asuna
402201301_17_a
I'd be lying if I said no,
but it's more than that...
Asuna
402201301_16_a
Nope, haven't heard about her.
Think she's gonna give you a run
for your money or something?
Liz
402201301_15_a
Yeah, and it seems she's entered
this competition.
Asuna
402201301_14_a
Crazy-good cooking skills, eh?
Liz
402201301_13_a
Have you heard anything about a
player with crazy-good cooking
skills who just started ALO?
Asuna
402201301_12_a
I will!
Oh, wait! Before you go...
Asuna
402201301_11_a
Ahh, okay. Well, go kick some
culinary butt!
Liz
402201301_10_a
so I want to make sure I'm ready
for anything.
Asuna
402201301_9_a
Ordinarily, no. But I'm competing
against other players in a cooking
competition,
Asuna
402201301_8_a
You don't use that for everyday
cooking, do you? Your stats are
pretty high already.
Liz
402201301_7_a
That's a pretty serious knife,
though.
Liz
402201301_6_a
Yeah, but thanks to you, it's as
good as new! I knew you were
the one for the job.
Asuna
402201301_5_a
One knife, freshly sharpened. You
weren't kidding when you said
it'd lost its edge!
Liz
402201301_4_a
Thanks, Liz!
Asuna
402201301_3_a
Asuna
402201301_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Hey-oh! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Liz
402201301_1_a
Hmm...
Asuna
402201201_23_a
No, and I don't really know what
she looks like either.
Leafa
402201201_22_a
Do you know if she's here yet?
Asuna
402201201_21_a
...
Asuna
402201201_20_a
Yeah, you know, you're right.
Maybe she imported her avatar
over from another game?
Leafa
402201201_19_a
Hmm... That sounds a little fishy,
doesn't it?
Asuna
402201201_18_a
Well, there's this one woman whose
cooking skill is off the charts,
despite being new to the game.
Leafa
402201201_17_a
Elite players? Like who?
Asuna
402201201_16_a
I can't beat you, though, let
alone all the other elite
players I've heard are entering.
Leafa
402201201_15_a
Hahaha! The truth comes out.
Asuna
402201201_14_a
...And then Sakuya told me to
enter on behalf of the Sylphs.
Leafa
402201201_13_a
That makes sense.
Asuna
402201201_12_a
and you need speed for that, so...
I figured I'd give it a shot,
since I'm in the Sylph's top five.
Leafa
402201201_11_a
Like, I know cooking is the most
important stat, but you need to
know ingredients, be able to hunt,
Leafa
402201201_10_a
Not at all... Wait, I thought this
tested all of your skills?
Leafa
402201201_9_a
Have you been working on your
cooking skills?
Asuna
402201201_8_a
That's not true at all!
Asuna
402201201_7_a
But it looks like I've got a slim
chance of winning if you're
playing too.
Leafa
402201201_6_a
Yeah, that's why I'm here...
Leafa
402201201_5_a
Did you enter the competition too?
Asuna
402201201_4_a
Leafa?
Asuna
402201201_3_a
Oh, hey Asuna!
Leafa
402201201_2_a
bg_event_field
Hmm, so this is the Survival
Cooking area.
Asuna
402201201_1_a
Good luck!
Kirito
402201101_16_a
Hehe. Well, it looks like I've
got a contest to enter!
Asuna
402201101_15_a
I know. Just hearing you say that
is enough for me.
Kirito
402201101_14_a
But you're the one who got me
interested in VR cooking in the
first place.
Asuna
402201101_13_a
Me? Hah, no thanks, I'll pass.
You know I can't cook to save
my life.
Kirito
402201101_12_a
Hehe, thanks for telling me about
it. Are you going to do it too?
Asuna
402201101_11_a
I thought you'd be interested.
Kirito
402201101_10_a
That actually sounds kind of fun.
Maybe I'll give it a shot.
Asuna
402201101_9_a
It's a test of all your skills
that just happens to emphasize
cooking.
Kirito
402201101_8_a
Meat and fish come from monster
drops, so you have to be able
to fight, as well.
Kirito
402201101_7_a
Yeah. You have to be able to
gather fruits and vegetables too.
Kirito
402201101_6_a
Huh. So you need more than solid
cooking skills to participate?
Asuna
402201101_5_a
You have to collect specific
ingredients from a given area and
make a dish with them.
Kirito
402201101_4_a
Yeah, it's a new kind of
competition.
Kirito
402201101_3_a
Kirito
402201101_2_a
bg_21_alne
Survival Cooking?
Asuna
402201101_1_a
Yeah!
Asuna
402101201_20_a
Ooh, it looks super rich and
creamy! This is gonna be so good!
Leafa
402101201_19_a
It's like our Valentine's Day
gift to each other!
Silica
402101201_18_a
Yeah!
Silica
402101201_17_a
F-Forget about it! Anyway, let's
dig into this chocolate we worked
our butts off to get!
Liz
402101201_16_a
I'm not sure what you mean...
Asuna
402101201_15_a
Ahaha... I knew it! There's no way
anyone could possibly compete
with you!
Liz
402101201_14_a
Oh...
Leafa
402101201_13_a
And, as a VRMMO player, I just
want to explore any new area
that comes out.
Asuna
402101201_12_a
As someone who loves to cook,
I'm just fascinated by rare food.
Asuna
402101201_11_a
Um... No reason, really.
Asuna
402101201_10_a
Then why did you want to get this
Honey Bittersweet chocolate?
Silica
402101201_9_a
Oh, he'll be fine. I'm going to
give him handmade chocolate,
after all.
Asuna
402101201_8_a
But what about Kirito?
Liz
402101201_7_a
So even though we just got the
one, we're going to split it up
and eat it!
Asuna
402101201_6_a
Ahaha, why WOULD I? The four of us
worked so hard together to get it!
Asuna
402101201_5_a
WH-WHAT?!
Why not?!
Liz
402101201_4_a
Silica
402101201_3_a
Liz
402101201_2_a
bg_event_valentine
No, actually, I'm not.
Asuna
402101201_1_a
Huh...?
Asuna
402101101_19_a
Hey, Asuna... You're giving that
to Kirito, right?
Liz
402101101_18_a
Ewww, that's kind of gross if
you think about it, hahaha.
Leafa
402101101_17_a
The various flavors of all the
chocolates it consumed combined to
make this unique treat."
Asuna
402101101_16_a
It says, "This rare chocolate was
formed inside the body of
a sweet-toothed Kobold.
Asuna
402101101_15_a
...!
Liz
402101101_14_a
item_event_valentine
It's the Honey Bittersweet
Chocolate...
Asuna
402101101_13_a
Or whoever got the last attack,
or who dealt the most damage
during battle...
Silica
402101101_12_a
Me neither... Maybe it goes right
to the party leader?
Liz
402101101_11_a
Huh? I didn't get anything...

Hey... It dropped something!
Asuna
402101101_9_a
Hehehe, but I think we all feel
the same way!
Silica
402101101_8_a
Hahaha, it was really wearing on
your nerves, wasn't it?
Leafa
402101101_7_a
And it feels GREAT! Like finally
scratching that itch you couldn't
reach!
Liz
402101101_6_a
We did it!
We finally beat it!
Asuna

Gaaahhh... Impossible...
Kobold
402101101_1_a
Alright, let's do this!
Asuna
402101001_26_a
Hehe, right!
Liz
402101001_25_a
Silica
402101001_24_a
Save that line for AFTER we
defeat this thing!
Leafa
402101001_23_a
Yeah! Talk about good things
coming to those who wait!
Liz
402101001_22_a
I bet we can finally beat it!
Asuna
402101001_21_a
Yeah... Maybe now it's not
invincible anymore!
Asuna
402101001_20_a
Ahaha, so that's how this goes!
Leafa
402101001_19_a
It must have gotten really out of
shape after eating all that
chocolate!
Silica
402101001_18_a
It looks like it's out of
breath...

wheeze

Kobold
402101001_16_a
Shhhlll...uuuurpp...
cough
cough
Kobold
402101001_15_a
No, you're right! My skirt's
barely even moving!
Silica
402101001_14_a
Is it just me, or is it not as
strong as before?
Leafa
402101001_13_a
Yeah... Huh?
Asuna
402101001_12_a
Right on schedule!
Liz
402101001_11_a
Shhluuuurp!
Kobold
402101001_10_a
What are you muttering about?
Hurry up and gimme my chocolate!
Kobold
402101001_9_a
I bet we could totally take it
in a fight now!
Silica
402101001_8_a
It's moving pretty slow, too...
Leafa
402101001_7_a
Whoa, now you can really tell it's
been packing on the pounds!
Liz
402101001_6_a
Hehe...
Asuna
402101001_5_a

Gahahaha! You idiots again!
Kobold
402101001_1_a
Oh, Liz...
Silica
402100901_20_a
Just forget I said anything, okay?
Liz
402100901_19_a
Hehe, it's not like me to wallow
in self-pity...
Liz
402100901_18_a
It really is amazing the lengths
she'll go to for the people
she cares about...
Liz
402100901_17_a
I just know Asuna's trying so hard
to complete this quest so she can
give Kirito that chocolate.
Liz
402100901_16_a
Liz...
Leafa
402100901_15_a
sigh
...
No one can compete with that...
Liz
402100901_14_a
never giving up no matter the
danger, inspiring courage in
her allies...
Liz
402100901_13_a
Not just that, but thinking fast
enough to use its own attack
against it,
Liz
402100901_12_a
Yeah. Not just anyone would notice
a subtle change in a monster's
appearance like she did.
Leafa
402100901_11_a
Anyway... Asuna really is
something else, isn't she?
Liz
402100901_10_a
I see...
Silica
402100901_9_a
Asuna did say she's doing it
of her own free will and all...
Liz
402100901_8_a
Apparently they've been getting
along okay, though, since Asuna's
kept her promise to study.
Liz
402100901_7_a
She sounds very strict...
Silica
402100901_6_a
Her mom did tell her she needed
to study, or else...
Silica
402100901_5_a
Yeah...
Liz
402100901_4_a
Silica
402100901_3_a
Liz
402100901_2_a
bg_event_valentine_sunset
Huh? Did Asuna leave already?
Leafa
402100901_1_a
That's right!
Leafa
402100801_22_a
Then let's keep our chins up and
go get that chocolate! Again!
Asuna
402100801_21_a
Y-Yeah...
Liz
402100801_20_a
I think you're on to something!
There's still hope for us yet!
Silica
402100801_19_a
But if it IS getting fatter, then
there must be a reason for it!
There has to be an end result!
Leafa
402100801_18_a
Though, even if we do fatten it up,
I have no clue what that might
lead to, if anything... Ehehe...
Asuna
402100801_17_a
I bet it'll get so fat you could
tell from far away.
Asuna
402100801_16_a
It only changed a tiny bit this
time, but if we keep feeding it...
Asuna
402100801_15_a
I'm positive that Kobold gets a
little fatter each time it eats
chocolate...
Asuna
402100801_14_a
Maybe I noticed the difference
because I got closer to it than
any of you did.
Asuna
402100801_13_a
I didn't notice it being any
bigger than the first time...
Silica
402100801_12_a
Wait, it got fat?
Liz
402100801_11_a
Huh...?
Leafa
402100801_10_a
Yeah, I know. I'd wager that the
Kobold getting fat is part of the
event too...
Asuna
402100801_9_a
So that event really is
inevitable...
Leafa
402100801_8_a
The reason your attack didn't do
anything is because we can't hurt
that Kobold the way it is.
Leafa
402100801_7_a
Yeah... I've been thinking about
that fight...
Leafa
402100801_6_a
It's not going to turn out
any differently...
Silica
402100801_5_a
Are you really just going to keep
gathering chocolate, Asuna?
Liz
402100801_4_a
Silica
402100801_3_a
Liz
402100801_2_a
bg_event_valentine
Well... I guess we just have to
go get more chocolate...
Asuna
402100801_1_a
...
Asuna
402100701_24_a
Heh heh... This stuff really is
tasty... Go on, get some more
for me to eat!
Kobold
402100701_23_a
No!
Silica
402100701_22_a
Grrrr!
Leafa
402100701_21_a
Ahhh, it's stealing the chocolate
again!
Liz
402100701_20_a
SHHHUUUUUURRRRP!
Kobold
402100701_19_a
Now I'm going to take
what's mine...
Kobold
402100701_18_a
What...!
It didn't work?!
Asuna
402100701_17_a
Hehehe...
What were you hoping to achieve?
Kobold
402100701_16_a
Wait...!
Look!
Silica
402100701_15_a
Leave it to Asuna to come up
with a plan like that!
Leafa
402100701_14_a
She did it! She attacked by
letting herself be pulled in!
Liz
402100701_13_a
Take THIS!
Asuna
402100701_12_a
Hnngghh?!
Kobold
402100701_11_a
Then I can strike!
Asuna
402100701_10_a
If I can use this force to my
advantage and add my own speed
to it...
Asuna
402100701_9_a
Maybe it only takes the chocolate
if we don't put up a fight...!
Asuna
402100701_8_a
It's doing it again!
Silica
402100701_7_a
SHHHLLLUUUURRRPPP!
Kobold
402100701_6_a
Maybe this time you'll learn
your lesson!
Kobold
402100701_5_a
Liz
402100701_4_a
Asuna
402100701_3_a
Silica
402100701_2_a
bg_event_valentine
Still at it, are you? You just
don't know when to stop!
Kobold
402100701_1_a
Giving up now would leave a bad
taste in my mouth, so count me in!
Liz
402100601_26_a
Seconded!
Silica
402100601_25_a
Totally!
Leafa
402100601_24_a
True... Well, I can't promise we
won't fail again, but we should
definitely keep trying.
Asuna
402100601_23_a
Yeah, but we also need to stop it
from running away once it's done.
Liz
402100601_22_a
We just have to figure out how
to stop it sucking up everything...
Silica
402100601_21_a
I definitely get the feeling we'd
probably get something awesome
if we could do that...
Leafa
402100601_20_a
It's a possibility, right?
Asuna
402100601_19_a
So I'm thinking if we can find
some way of dealing with that
Kobold, we can get the chocolate.
Asuna
402100601_18_a
It's mostly a hunch... But that
was the only event that's happened
in this area so far, right?
Asuna
402100601_17_a
What makes you say that?
Liz
402100601_16_a
I think that Kobold might have
been a hint about the Honey
Bittersweet...
Asuna
402100601_15_a
Me...?
Asuna
402100601_14_a
What do you think, Asuna?
Silica
402100601_13_a
so it might be better to leave
before we collect too much...
Leafa
402100601_12_a
Maybe... But we'll end up in the
same position if we do
the same thing all over again,
Leafa
402100601_11_a
Now what? Do we just start over
from scratch?
Liz
402100601_10_a
...
Asuna
402100601_9_a
Considering the monster's actions,
I wouldn't be surprised if it was
something unavoidable like that.
Leafa
402100601_8_a
It could be an event that triggers
once you get a certain amount of
chocolate...
Liz
402100601_7_a
They said the same Kobold ambushed
them and stole all their
chocolate too...
Silica
402100601_6_a
I just spoke to a few other
players who came here today...
Silica
402100601_5_a
Seriously... No Honey Bittersweet,
and now no normal chocolate
either...
Leafa
402100601_4_a
Silica
402100601_3_a
Leafa
402100601_2_a
bg_event_valentine
Ugh, this is dumb...
Liz
402100601_1_a
But I lost sight of that Kobold...
Asuna
402100501_25_a
Y-Yeah...
Asuna
402100501_24_a
Silica
402100501_23_a
Asuna
402100501_22_a
You okay, Asuna?!
Liz
402100501_21_a
Wha
! I can't see anything through
this dust cloud!
Asuna
402100501_20_a
Heh, I've had my fill for one day!
Kobold
402100501_19_a
Hyaaaaaaahhh!
Asuna
402100501_18_a
Grrr... Over my dead body!
Asuna
402100501_17_a
That thing's stealing the
chocolate we worked so
hard to get!
Liz
402100501_16_a
Gaaaah, n-not again!
Silica
402100501_15_a
SHHLLUUUURRRRRPPP!
Kobold
402100501_14_a
That's it! That's the source of
that tasty smell! And it's all
MINE!
Kobold
402100501_13_a
Is that...chocolate?! Ahhh, it's
coming out of me too!
Leafa
402100501_12_a
Huh?! Th-There's something coming
out from your avatars...!
Leafa
402100501_11_a
Wait! Guys, look!
Liz
402100501_10_a
Ahaha, looks like the only damage
it deals is to the pride of anyone
wearing a skirt...
Leafa
402100501_9_a
Gaaaah, mine too!
Asuna
402100501_8_a
Aaaahhh! M-My skirt...!
Silica
402100501_7_a
But this attack isn't dealing us
any damage... So then what's
the point of it?
Liz
402100501_6_a
I-It's getting hard to stay
standing!
Asuna

Wh-What the hell!

402100401_29_a
No, it's not! That Kobold is just
sucking up everything around it!
Asuna
402100401_28_a
I-Is this wind magic?!
Leafa
402100401_27_a
Huh?!
Silica
402100401_26_a
I must have it!
Kobold
402100401_25_a
sniff
sniff
Ooh, that smells good!
Kobold
402100401_24_a
If it's talking, then that must
mean it's a unique monster...
Asuna
402100401_23_a
It's a Kobold!
Liz
402100401_22_a
A monster?!

402100401_19_a
Huh?!

You there...
That looks tasty...
???
402100401_17_a
Ahaha...
Asuna
402100401_16_a
It feels like we're just playing
a hack and slash game...
Leafa
402100401_15_a
We must be missing something...
We've beaten pretty much every
monster in this area...
Asuna
402100401_14_a
sigh
We've done everything the
rumors said to do, and we're still
not getting that rare chocolate...
Liz
402100401_13_a
I-It did! Not anything as tasty as
what we're after, but close!
Silica
402100401_12_a
So? Did it drop any chocolate?!
Leafa
402100401_11_a
Th-Thank you very much!
Silica
402100401_10_a
That last attack was amazing!
Asuna
402100401_9_a
Nice job, Silica.

Yeah!
Silica
402100301_37_a
Y-You're right!
Leafa
402100301_36_a
and then how to get it! Our top
priority right now should be
collecting information!
Liz
402100301_35_a
But let's cross that bridge when
we get to it! First we have to
find out if it even exists,
Liz
402100301_34_a
It's true we don't know how many
of those rare chocolates we'll
get...
Liz
402100301_33_a
S-Speak for yourself!
I certainly wasn't!
Leafa
402100301_32_a
A-All three of us were thinking
about what we want that chocolate
for, weren't we?!
Silica

Ugh, don't everyone all speak up
at once!

Ah...!
Liz
402100301_25_a
what happens if it's set up so
you can only get one per party?
Leafa
402100301_24_a
Well, even if we do manage to get
that super rare chocolate,
Leafa
402100301_23_a
What're you talking about?
Liz
402100301_22_a
I get neither of you are thinking
too far ahead, but we can't let
this get between us.
Leafa
402100301_21_a
Come on, you two, calm down...
Leafa
402100301_20_a
Th-That's different!
Silica
402100301_19_a
S-Says the girl who literally ran
away from questions about her
special Valentine!
Liz
402100301_18_a
Liz, you're just bringing that
up to deflect from your true
feelings...
Silica
402100301_17_a
Oh yeah, the Honey Bittersweet.
You have to wonder what it
actually tastes like...
Leafa
402100301_16_a
I just want try to some of that
Honey-whatever chocolate for
myself!
Liz
402100301_15_a
D-Don't be stupid, that's not
what this is about!
Liz
402100301_14_a
Or are you letting her win this
battle so you can win the war?
Leafa
402100301_13_a
You know she's going to give that
to Kirito, right...?
Leafa
402100301_12_a
Liz... Are you sure about this?
I mean, that chocolate's totally
"special Valentine"-grade...

Alright. I've actually got plans
for the rest of today, so I'll
see you guys later!
Asuna

But Liz...
Silica
402100201_26_a
Hehe, then it's decided!
Liz
402100201_25_a
Yeah, that sounds good to me!
Asuna
402100201_24_a
That means getting it must be
pretty tough. It makes more sense
if we all work together.
Liz
402100201_23_a
If it's still just a rumor, then
not many people have actually
gotten it, right?
Liz
402100201_22_a
Yeah, Liz, "what?"
Leafa
402100201_21_a
What?
Asuna
402100201_20_a
Hey, if you want, we could help
you get that chocolate.
Liz
402100201_19_a
Hmmmm...
Liz
402100201_18_a
Wow...
Silica
402100201_17_a
It's the hot topic in cooking
guilds and among anyone with a
high-level cooking skill.
Asuna
402100201_16_a
A friend of mine who's super into
cooking told me.
Asuna
402100201_15_a
We haven't heard one word about
anything like that here, and no
one's talking about it online...
Liz
402100201_14_a
But where did you hear about it?
Liz
402100201_13_a
Whoa... Just listening to you
describe it is making me drool...
Leafa
402100201_12_a
I've heard it costs an arm and a
leg to buy just one bite...
Asuna
402100201_11_a
They say it's so good, it's pretty
much a divine experience.
Asuna
402100201_10_a
Yeah, a type called
Honey Bittersweet.
Asuna
402100201_9_a
You can?
Leafa
402100201_8_a
That's not why I came, though.
Apparently you can get really rare
chocolate in this area.
Asuna
402100201_7_a
Oh, that's right, the monsters
here do drop chocolate...
Asuna
402100201_6_a
You're here for the chocolate too?

402100101_38_a
Silica
402100101_37_a
Ack
sorry!
Asuna
402100101_36_a
Hngaah!
Silica
402100101_35_a
Leafa
402100101_34_a
She ran into that shop!
Liz
402100101_33_a
N-Now's my chance!
Silica
402100101_32_a
Leafa
402100101_31_a
Wha
! She slipped out from
under your legs, Leafa!
Liz
402100101_30_a
Uwaaaaah!
Silica
402100101_29_a
C'mere!
Leafa
402100101_28_a
Heh heh, we've got you now!
Liz
402100101_27_a
Uwaah!
I-I'm surrounded!
Silica
402100101_26_a
And we won't! She's fast,
but I'm faster!
Leafa
402100101_25_a
We can't let her get away!
Liz
402100101_24_a
Ah! She ran off!
Leafa
402100101_23_a
Grrrr! Meanies!
Silica
402100101_22_a
As if!
Liz
402100101_21_a
J-Just forget I said anything!
Silica
402100101_20_a
Heh heh heh... Come on!
Secrets don't make friends!
Leafa
402100101_19_a
Heh heh heh... Well, Silica?
Who's YOUR special Valentine?
Liz
402100101_18_a
I-I didn't mean to say that...!
Silica
402100101_17_a
Th-Then what do you do about
getting something for your
special Valentine...?
Silica
402100101_16_a
But if the chocolate here is just
for your friends...
Silica
402100101_15_a
And you can't beat free, hehe.
Liz
402100101_14_a
Luckily you can get plenty of
tasty chocolate right here for
free!
Liz
402100101_13_a
Hehe, yeah, you'd never be able to
afford buying chocolate for all
those friends.
Liz
402100101_12_a
Oh, and I forgot to include Recon!
Leafa
402100101_11_a
Well, Kirito, Agil, Klein...
and some other players I'm
friends with.
Leafa
402100101_10_a
Who are you planning on giving
chocolate to, Leafa?
Silica
402100101_9_a
Yeah, that's what I've heard.
Leafa
402100101_8_a
And the monsters around here drop
chocolates this time of year.
Liz
402100101_7_a
Ehehe, I guess it's pretty
obvious. This is a special
Valentine's Day area, after all...
Leafa
402100101_6_a
If you're here, that must mean...
Liz
402100101_5_a
Oh, hi Leafa!
Silica
402100101_4_a
Liz
402100101_3_a
Silica
402100101_2_a
bg_event_valentine_town
Hey Liz, hey Silica!
Leafa
402100101_1_a
Heheh, alright! I'll be sure to
get all of this down so I can
pass it on to Alicia later!
Silica
402001201_31_a
Hahaha, yeah. We're all so full
of useful ideas!
Leafa
402001201_30_a
Then they can give these ideas
to the Lords for discussion during
their next meeting.
Sinon
402001201_29_a
Leafa
402001201_28_a
Silica
402001201_27_a
Heheh! Someone should be
taking notes here.
Sinon
402001201_26_a
Totally!
I'm gonna win it all next time!
Klein
402001201_25_a
Agreed!
Philia
402001201_24_a
Klein
402001201_23_a
Philia
402001201_22_a
Yeah. Still, I had a blast. Just
tweak the rules bit by bit, and
I'm sure it'll get even better.
Kirito
402001201_21_a
especially when they're brand-new.
All you can do is solve each
problem as it comes up...
Leafa
402001201_20_a
Ah... Well, these player-organized
events are always riddled with
issues like that,
Leafa
402001201_19_a
but everyone started arguing
before we could beat it...
Silica
402001201_18_a
We decided to team up to
try and take down this
super-strong monster,
Silica
402001201_17_a
What happened?
Leafa
402001201_16_a
Leafa
402001201_15_a
Silica
402001201_14_a
It wasn't your fault, Klein. That
Cait Sith shouldn't have been so
stingy with potions.
Sinon
402001201_13_a
Philia
402001201_12_a
Kirito
402001201_11_a
Ugh, the shame...
Klein
402001201_10_a
Ahahaha... Yeah, that was bad...
Silica
402001201_9_a
Leafa
402001201_8_a
Silica
402001201_7_a
Not to mention the other
big issue
the Salamanders and
Cait Sith turning on each other.
Sinon
402001201_6_a
It'd be a good idea to look
at each race's specialties and
draw up handicaps for them.
Philia
402001201_5_a
Yeah. We got lucky this time, but
I doubt we'll catch a break like
that again.
Kirito
402001201_4_a
Philia
402001201_3_a
Kirito
402001201_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
So in the end that area basically
gave the Spriggans home-field
advantage, huh?
Klein
402001201_1_a
Sinon
402001101_28_a
Yes! Let's do that!
Silica
402001101_27_a
Oooh, yeah! That sounds fun!
Philia
402001101_26_a
Then we can compare notes
and share ideas.
Kirito
402001101_25_a
Philia
402001101_24_a
Great. Once that's all done, we
should all get together and have
our own celebration.
Kirito
402001101_23_a
Sinon
402001101_22_a
Ah, yes! There is.
Silica
402001101_21_a
Isn't there a closing
ceremony to mark the end of the
event or something?
Kirito
402001101_20_a
Kirito
402001101_19_a
Um, so do we like, go back to
our respective camps now, or...?
Philia
402001101_18_a
I'm in.
Sinon
402001101_17_a
Sinon
402001101_16_a
Okay!
Silica
402001101_15_a
Philia
402001101_14_a
Agreed. We should do this Dogfight
Derby again sometime.
Kirito
402001101_13_a
Yeah, you're right...
It was pretty awesome.
Sinon
402001101_12_a
Fighting Kirito and the
other Spriggans like
that was exhilarating.
Silica
402001101_11_a
Hehe, you're right...
But I still had a lot of fun!
Silica
402001101_10_a
Hehe, I think you might need to
revise the rules of this game a
bit, Silica.
Sinon
402001101_9_a
Silica
402001101_8_a
Which is why areas that are as
rich in enhancers as this one give
Spriggans the edge...
Sinon
402001101_7_a
It's just too bad you can't save
them up like EXP or equipment.
Philia
402001101_6_a
Philia
402001101_5_a
Collecting every enhancer you can
is par for the course in MOBA
games.
Kirito
402001101_4_a
Yeah... I hate to say it, but the
Spriggans were just better
than us...
Sinon
402001101_3_a
Sinon
402001101_2_a
bg_event_desert
Ugh... My HP dropped below ten
percent...! I lost!
Silica
402001101_1_a
Come on! This is the last battle
of Dogfight Derby!
Let's make it a good one!
Silica
402001001_41_a
Silica
402001001_40_a
Not bad, not bad at all...
But we're still not going to
roll over for you!
Sinon
402001001_39_a
You say that like it's a
good thing...
Philia
402001001_38_a
We each took enough for
an overdose and a half!
Kirito
402001001_37_a
Collecting so many rare items was
a cinch with so many of us
in one place!
Kirito
402001001_36_a
Philia
402001001_35_a
That's part of what makes us
Spriggans special!
Kirito
402001001_34_a
Sinon
402001001_33_a
What...? Oh no!
Silica
402001001_32_a
Not to mention we have the
advantage when it comes to
finding items!
Philia
402001001_31_a
Philia
402001001_30_a
Heheh! But will it be enough?
You wasted a lot of time fighting
that fox, after all.
Kirito
402001001_29_a
Silica
402001001_28_a
Of course you are. But you're not
the only ones who gathered
enhancers.
Sinon
402001001_27_a
Which means, for a little bit at
least, we're all pretty much
superhuman!
Philia
402001001_26_a
Yep. We made sure we got every
last enhancer in this whole
area first.
Philia
402001001_25_a
But we didn't come here
entirely unprepared.
Kirito
402001001_24_a
Philia
402001001_23_a
I don't doubt it, Silica.
Kirito
402001001_22_a
Or any of you Spriggans,
for that matter!
Silica
402001001_21_a
Sinon
402001001_20_a
You know you can't beat me so
easily, if I have what it takes to
get this outfit! Huh, Kirito?
Silica
402001001_19_a
I'm kind of jealous you managed
to get your hands on that
Flamefox kimono. It's so rare...
Philia
402001001_18_a
Kirito
402001001_17_a
Hah! I knew Silica was after that
Flamefox!
Philia
402001001_16_a
Silica
402001001_15_a
Kirito... Philia...
Sinon
402001001_14_a
Philia
402001001_13_a
Hey, you two.
Kirito
402001001_12_a
Yeah...
Silica
402001001_11_a
So, now that the Salamanders are
out, you know who that leaves...
Sinon
402001001_10_a
Alright! I'll wear this
Flamefox costume with pride!
Silica
402001001_9_a
Right!
Cait Sith
402001001_8_a
Everyone's cool with you keeping
it. Right, guys?
Sinon
402001001_7_a
Thanks, Sinon...
Silica
402001001_6_a
Not to mention, you're the one who
thought up this whole Dogfight
Derby thing in the first place.
Sinon
402001001_5_a
Of course! We never would have
gotten this far if it weren't
for you.
Sinon
402001001_4_a
Th-Thank you. Are you sure
I can have this?
Silica
402001001_3_a
Silica
402001001_2_a
bg_event_desert
Heheh! That looks good
on you, Silica.
Sinon
402001001_1_a
sniff
...
Good luck, guys...
Leafa
402000901_26_a
Oh yeah.
See you around, Leafa!
Kirito
402000901_25_a
Hehe, this oughta be fun.
Philia
402000901_24_a
Now we just have to settle the
score with Silica and Sinon.
Kirito
402000901_23_a
Leafa
402000901_22_a
So... The architect of this event
herself is still in the running...
Kirito
402000901_21_a
Which means it's just us Spriggans
and the Cait Sith!
Philia
402000901_20_a
Leafa
402000901_19_a
Are you serious?!
Kirito
402000901_18_a
Holy crap!
The Salamanders are out!
Philia
402000901_17_a
What does it say?
Kirito
402000901_16_a
Hey, there's another alert...
Philia
402000901_15_a
Which means Klein,
Silica, and Sinon.
Kirito
402000901_14_a
The Cait Sith and Salamanders,
according to the most recent
alert.
Philia
402000901_13_a
Haha, yeah. But this means the
Sylph are out of the running.
And that leaves...?
Kirito
402000901_12_a
Though I guess you can't blame the
losing party for shouting a few
choice words in defeat...
Philia
402000901_11_a
Ahaha! Come on guys, this
is no time for a sibling rivalry!
Philia
402000901_10_a
Kirito
402000901_9_a
Oh, shut up already, Kirito!
Leafa
402000901_8_a
I'd go thank Silica for thinking
that rule up if I were you.
Kirito
402000901_7_a
But once your HP dips under ten
percent, you're out.
Kirito
402000901_6_a
You can't kill or be killed during
Dogfight Derby, after all.
Kirito
402000901_5_a
Hehe! Well, at least there's no
death penalty, right?
Kirito
402000901_4_a
Philia
402000901_3_a
Kirito
402000901_2_a
bg_event_desert
Ugh, I can't believe I lost!
Leafa
402000901_1_a
Thank you, Klein...
Silica
402000801_25_a
I'll be sure to teach them right
from wrong once this battle's
over...
Klein
402000801_24_a
Well, we can't keep going like
this! Whatever the reason, my side
lashed out first.
Klein
402000801_23_a
I was afraid this might happen...
Klein, what do you want to do?
Sinon
402000801_22_a
Enough already! Take a chill pill!
Both of you!
Klein
402000801_21_a
YOU'RE the one who betrayed ME!
Salamander
402000801_20_a
Th-This stupid Salamander
started it! Leaping on me like
that
Cait Sith
402000801_19_a
Hey! What the heck are you
guys thinking?!
Klein
402000801_18_a
Wha
! Hnnggg!
Cait Sith
402000801_17_a
You little punk!
Salamander
402000801_16_a
Th-That's not true!
Cait Sith
402000801_15_a
Say what?! I knew it! You were
planning to throw us under
the bus this whole time!
Salamander
402000801_14_a
Figure it out yourselves!
Cait Sith
402000801_13_a
No way! I don't have enough
potions to just go wasting one
on you!
Cait Sith
402000801_12_a
Owww...
Hey, I could use a heal here!
Salamander
402000801_11_a
Heheh! It sure does!
Sinon
402000801_10_a
It really does feel like we're
in the middle of a dogfight!
Silica
402000801_9_a
A giant beast, two races that hate
each other... This is turning into
quite the mess...!
Sinon
402000801_6_a
I can't believe how strong it is!
Silica
402000801_5_a
Klein
402000801_8_a
Silica
402000801_7_a
Klein
402000801_4_a
Sinon
402000801_3_a
Silica
402000801_2_a
bg_event_desert
GRRGGAAAAAAHHH!
Flamefox
402000801_1_a
Right behind you!
Sinon
402000701_26_a
You can say that again...
Alright, let's go!
Silica
402000701_25_a
sigh
I guess this makes us
frenemies. Still, I'm glad for
the help...
Sinon
402000701_24_a
Just this once... But only because you said
so, Klein!
Salamander
402000701_23_a
These guys would never do that!
Just focus on fighting
this fox!
Klein
402000701_22_a
What's to stop you turning on
us in the middle of the fight?! No
way can we trust you!
Salamander
402000701_21_a
But... We're in the middle of
a competition!
Salamander
402000701_20_a
We need to work together if we're
gonna take this giant thing down!
All of us!
Sinon
402000701_19_a
Hey Klein
truce?!
Sinon
402000701_18_a
Wh-What the
Oh sure, NOW it shows up!
Klein
402000701_17_a
snarl
...
Flamefox
402000701_16_a
Silica
402000701_15_a
Klein
402000701_14_a
What is it?!
Sinon
402000701_13_a
S-Silica! Sinon!
Look!
Cait Sith
402000701_12_a
We'll see about that!
Klein
402000701_11_a
I-I won't let you have it! We're
going to get it first!
Silica
402000701_10_a
Yeah. I mean, it gives you a huge
leg up in the stupid-hot
temperatures in our territory.
Klein
402000701_9_a
Hehe... "Too," huh?
So that IS what you're after.
Sinon
402000701_8_a
Hey, wait a second. You guys are
after the Flamefox item too,
aren't you?
Klein
402000701_7_a
Klein...
Silica
402000701_6_a
Yep, just like you with your
Cait Sith buds.
Klein
402000701_5_a
Klein! I should have known you'd
be helping out your fellow
Salamanders.
Sinon
402000701_4_a
Silica
402000701_3_a
Sinon
402000701_2_a
bg_event_desert
Whoa! If it ain't Sinon and Silica!
Klein
402000701_1_a
Okay!
Cait Sith
402000601_19_a
It's possible...
Get ready, guys, we've got
a fight on our hands!
Sinon
402000601_18_a
Could they be after the Flamefox
too?!
Silica
402000601_17_a
We've got Salamanders
coming our way!
Sinon
402000601_16_a
Hehe, you're welcome...
But maybe don't thank me just yet!
Sinon
402000601_15_a
And I never would have thought of
it without advice from a GGO pro
like you, so thank you!
Silica
402000601_14_a
Yeah. You'd never be able to find
people to fight without it.
It's really helpful.
Silica
402000601_13_a
That must be pain for the
organizer... But it's necessary to
ensure the event runs well.
Sinon
402000601_12_a
so all that information on player
whereabouts has to be input
manually.
Sinon
402000601_11_a
Yeah, kind of like in GGO. Except
this a player-organized event,
Sinon
402000601_10_a
The one that tells you where all
the other players are?
Silica
402000601_9_a
I see... Hey, wait a second,
it's time for the alert again.
Sinon
402000601_8_a
And if you defeat it, you can get
a really special rare item!
Silica
402000601_7_a
Yes. There's a rare monster in this
area called a Flamefox. That could
be what's making the temperature soar.
Silica
402000601_6_a
Why? Wait, are you saying this
heat has to do with that rare
item you want?
Sinon
402000601_5_a
But our location might not be the
only factor...
Silica
402000601_4_a
Salamander territory is really
hot, isn't it?
Silica
402000601_3_a
Silica
402000601_2_a
bg_event_desert
Ugh... I'm melting...
Sinon
402000601_1_a
So I'll follow your lead!
Sinon
402000501_29_a
I see... Well, you seem to have
all this planned out to a T...
Sinon
402000501_28_a
Yeah. It seems like it just
started dropping.
Silica
402000501_27_a
There is?
Sinon
402000501_26_a
There's also this rare item you can
only get around here.
Silica
402000501_25_a
We want to look for items with
temporary buffs first. Then,
if we can...
Silica
402000501_24_a
Are you sure we have time for
that, though?
Sinon
402000501_23_a
Yeah. There are a ton of items
that drop in this part of
Salamander territory.
Silica
402000501_22_a
Items?
Sinon
402000501_21_a
The first thing we should do is
gather any items we can find
around here.
Silica
402000501_20_a
I am?
Sinon
402000501_19_a
You're getting a little ahead
of yourself, Sinon.
Silica
402000501_18_a
So, what first? The target closest
to us is an Imp... Want to go
after it?
Sinon
402000501_17_a
Silica
402000501_16_a
Survival games start with you as
far from other players as
possible...
Sinon
402000501_15_a
O-Okay!
I'll kick as much as I can!
Silica
402000501_14_a
Hehe, I know you've got it in you!
Kick some butt for me, Silica!
Alicia
402000501_13_a
Heheh! But you have the advantage,
Silica. You're the one who made up
all the rules!
Sinon
402000501_12_a
gulp
... I'm not as strong as
you're making me out to be,
you know...
Silica
402000501_11_a
Yeaaaaah!
Cait Sith
402000501_10_a
So be brave, everyone! Be bold!
And fight like your life depends
on it!
Alicia
402000501_9_a
Oooh!
It's Silica and Sinon!
We can't lose if they're fighting!
Cait Sith
402000501_8_a
Hello...
Silica
402000501_7_a
Hi...
Sinon
402000501_6_a
Sadly the Lords and Dragoons can't
participate, but fear not, Cait
Sith! You have these two!
Alicia
402000501_5_a
Yaaaaay!
Cait Sith
402000501_4_a
Silica
402000501_3_a
Sinon
402000501_2_a
bg_event_desert
At long last, let me welcome you
to the inter-race survival game,
Dogfight Derby!
Alicia
402000501_1_a
Asuna
402000401_26_a
Heh.
May the best team win!
Kirito
402000401_25_a
Silica
402000401_24_a
Laying it out like that makes it
seem way more serious... I better
go strategize with Rain.
Liz
402000401_23_a
Oh, and you and Philia, Kirito.
Asuna
402000401_22_a
Let's see... There's Silica
and Sinonon, Agil and Strea,
and then Liz and Rain.
Asuna
402000401_21_a
Asuna
402000401_20_a
Probably, considering the only
ones from the same race are
Kirito
402000401_19_a
It's perfect! But... We're gonna
end up fighting each other during
this thing, aren't we?
Liz
402000401_18_a
Liz
402000401_17_a
Yeah. I wanted a simple way of
conveying what the event is
all about.
Silica
402000401_16_a
Asuna
402000401_15_a
And a derby is basically a
competition, right?
Kirito
402000401_14_a
I thought it was appropriate for
a game where you can fly.
Silica
402000401_13_a
Liz
402000401_12_a
Considering a "dogfight" is the
term for battles between
airplanes,
Silica
402000401_11_a
Dogfight Derby is a pretty cool
name, too. It sounds like it'll
be a blast!
Kirito
402000401_9_a
Asuna
402000401_10_a
Liz
402000401_8_a
Thank you, Asuna!
Silica
402000401_7_a
So congratulations! You've earned it!
Asuna
402000401_6_a
Kirito
402000401_5_a
Not really. You were the one who
thought it up and explained it
to Alicia.
Asuna
402000401_4_a
I-It's not just "my" plan!
You guys helped a bunch, too!
Silica
402000401_3_a
Silica
402000401_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Way to go, Silica! They're going
through with that plan of yours!
Liz
402000401_1_a
You don't have to tell me twice.
Sinon
402000301_30_a
I-I know! But I'm more than
a match for them!
Silica
402000301_29_a
Hehe, I see. But you know you'll
have to fight them if this plan
gets approved, right?
Sinon
402000301_28_a
Well, I had Liz and everyone
help me at school, too.
Silica
402000301_27_a
You really thought this plan
through, Silica.
Sinon
402000301_26_a
Thank yooou! I don't know what
I'd have done without you!
Alicia
402000301_25_a
A-Absolutely,
I'd love it if you did!
Silica
402000301_24_a
With your permission,
of course!
Alicia
402000301_23_a
Yes, yes, yes! This is it! I'm
totally presenting this idea
at the meeting!
Alicia
402000301_22_a
Yeah... This way, even people who
don't win will get something out
of it, and want to participate.
Silica
402000301_21_a
You've taken a page out of
the MOBA book so the focus isn't
just on fighting, huh?
Sinon
402000301_20_a
Plus that means we won't have to
arrange any prizes or anything!
It's win-win, haha!
Alicia
402000301_19_a
What more motivation do you need?
Alicia
402000301_18_a
So not only do you get to fight
in a survival game, you can
collect items while you're at it!
Alicia
402000301_17_a
This part of Salamander territory
is full of monsters that drop
great items!
Alicia
402000301_16_a
Exactly! And the best part is
the location you chose for the
battleground!
Alicia
402000301_15_a
Right. Controlled chaos,
as opposed to total anarchy.
Sinon
402000301_14_a
It'll be tough getting everyone to
agree on the rules, but it's way
better than a free-for-all!
Alicia
402000301_13_a
Silica
402000301_12_a
I love it! You could be onto
something here, Silica!
Alicia
402000301_11_a
Yeah! Like a duel tournament,
except for teams.
Silica
402000301_10_a
That's a good way of letting
the races fight in a more
controlled, contest-like setting.
Alicia
402000301_9_a
So you're proposing we set up a
survival game of sorts where
everyone can fight?
Alicia
402000301_8_a
there will be less reason for the
Lords to join in.
Silica
402000301_7_a
I know, I've been talking a lot.
But here's the point
since the
players set the rules,
Silica
402000301_6_a
...
Sinon
402000301_5_a
And we can limit the number of
players and party size, but we
should probably ask the Lords...
Silica
402000301_4_a
Alicia
402000301_3_a
Sinon
402000301_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
We can put these markers up all
around this field to draw the
boundaries...
Silica
402000301_1_a
Huh?
Sinon
402000201_22_a
Sinon, I've got a great idea!
Listen...
Silica
402000201_21_a
Yeah, more or less.
Sinon
402000201_20_a
That's where you form teams,
make up your own rules, and then
shoot at each other, right?
Silica
402000201_19_a
Yeah, those things are getting
more and more popular lately.
Sinon
402000201_18_a
Really?
Silica
402000201_17_a
She's really into survival games,
and wants me to join in since I'm
a decent shot.
Sinon
402000201_16_a
O-Oh...
Silica
402000201_15_a
Heheh, nope... She's a girl.
Sinon
402000201_14_a
I-Is it a boy player?
Silica
402000201_13_a
This player I just met keeps bugging
me about meeting up in real life.
Sinon
402000201_12_a
What is it?
Silica
402000201_11_a
Yeah, I did, but...
Ugh, what a pain!
Sinon
402000201_10_a
Did you get a message?
Silica
402000201_9_a
Me too... Hmm?
Sinon
402000201_8_a
Absolutely.
I wish there was something
we could do to help them...
Silica
402000201_7_a
But on the other hand, Lords
command a lot of respect because
they work so hard.
Sinon
402000201_6_a
Hahaha...
Silica
402000201_5_a
What a cruel irony it is
to get worked to death
playing a game...
Sinon
402000201_4_a
Seriously. Being a Lord does not
sound fun.
Sinon
402000201_3_a
Sinon
402000201_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Poor Alicia...
She has so much on her plate.
Silica
402000201_1_a
Ahaha! That sounds like the worst
kind of homework...
Silica
402000101_25_a
We're supposed to think up some
ideas by next week's meeting, but
I've got nothing!
Alicia
402000101_24_a
and play nice, too...
Sinon
402000101_23_a
B-But I like when we all get along
Sinon
402000101_22_a
I wouldn't mind if the fighting
got more intense. This game's
a cakewalk compared to GGO...
Sinon
402000101_21_a
I see... Well, I actually think
that it's fine the way it is.
Silica
402000101_20_a
It's so severe as it is now,
everyone's too afraid to take
the risk...
Alicia
402000101_19_a
Right... Like a decrease in
the race-wide penalty for
your Lord getting killed.
Alicia
402000101_18_a
You mean they'd need some sort of
incentive from the devs first?
Sinon
402000101_17_a
Even so, no Lord would be stupid
enough to dare incite war during
a time of peace.
Alicia
402000101_16_a
but of course others
like the
saber-rattling Salamanders
weren't exactly thrilled.
Alicia
402000101_15_a
We were all pretty much on the
same page. There were some who
were actually happy for the drop,
Alicia
402000101_14_a
So what did the Lords end up
deciding to do?
Silica
402000101_13_a
Yeah, the devs must understand
all that...
Alicia
402000101_12_a
and I feel like there must not be
that many players who take
pleasure in fighting other races.
Sinon
402000101_11_a
Hmm, that makes sense. There's no
more Grand Quest or anything
to worry about,
Sinon
402000101_10_a
Oh yeah?
Silica
402000101_9_a
we ended up talking about the
drop in inter-race fighting...
Alicia
402000101_8_a
Well... I guess it's all right to
tell you two. At the meeting of
the Lords the other day,
Alicia
402000101_7_a
Yeah, what's with all the heavy
sighing?
Sinon
402000101_6_a
Sinon
402000101_5_a
Alicia
402000101_4_a
What's the matter, Alicia?
Silica
402000101_3_a
Sinon
402000101_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
Hmmm...
Alicia
402000101_1_a
ふふっ、そうだね
リーファ
401901201_28_a
まあこのシナリオが好評なら
続きがあるかもしれないし、
気長に待つとしようぜ
キリト
401901201_27_a
できれば消さずに……
二人の物語の続きとかも
見てみたいです
シリカ
401901201_26_a
で、でもあたしは
あの二人の話好きでしたよ
シリカ
401901201_25_a
はは、まああくまで想像だけどな
キリト
401901201_24_a
って感じで今も
話し合ってるってこと?
ユウキ
401901201_23_a
「日本の昔話はさすがにやりすぎかもな
でもいきなり消去する前に
問題ないか確認しておくか～」
ユウキ
401901201_22_a
「なあなあ、自動生成で
こんなクエが作られちゃったけど
世界観的に大丈夫かよ?」
ユウキ
401901201_21_a
えっと、要するに……
ユウキ
401901201_20_a
そうだな、あれに比べたら今回規模は
小さいけど、運営側の判断で
やりすぎと思ったのかもしれない
キリト
401901201_19_a
あのままスリュムが地上に侵攻すれば
アルンやイグシティが
崩壊していたかもしれない……
アスナ
401901201_18_a
少し違うけど、エクスキャリバーの
クエストでも自動生成による
心配事はあったよね
アスナ
401901201_17_a
告知がいまだになかったのは、
そういうことなんだと思う
キリト
401901201_16_a
ああ、消すつもりなのか、
様子を見るつもりなのかは
わからないけど……
キリト
401901201_15_a
ええと……
待ったをかけたというのは、
世界観が合わないからなんですか?
シリカ
401901201_14_a
普通に考えると、
神や巨人や、魔法使いの物語に
浦島太郎が出るのは崩壊してる
キリト
401901201_13_a
もちろん今回は昔話のツギハギ部分を
埋めて、そこそこうまく
落とし込めてたとは思うが……
キリト
401901201_12_a
日本の神話は北欧神話メインの
ALOにとってはあまりにも
荒唐無稽だ
キリト
401901201_11_a
待った……?
リーファ
401901201_10_a
恐らくそれに対して、開発側から
待ったがかかったんじゃないかな
キリト
401901201_9_a
今回も日本の昔話ネタを
持ってきたんだろうけど……
キリト
401901201_8_a
カーディナルは世界の神話を参考に
シナリオや設定を盛るからな
キリト
401901201_7_a
開発者のハンドメイドじゃない
ってことだよね?
でもどうしてそう思うの?
アスナ
401901201_6_a
あの大きな島はALOの中でも
恐らく自動生成クエでできた
エリアだろう
キリト
401901201_5_a
これはあくまで
俺の想像なんだが……
キリト

えーっ、コホン
キリト
401901201_1_a
わ、わかったよ
とりあえず場所を変えよう
キリト
401901101_34_a
あ、あたしこういう悲恋物に
よ、弱いんですぅ～……!
シリカ
401901101_33_a
し、シリカ!?
なんで泣いてるの?
リーファ
401901101_32_a
ううっ……ぐすっ
あたしも……知りたいです……
シリカ
401901101_31_a
そうそう!
リーファ
401901101_30_a
それをちゃんと説明してほしい!
ユウキ
401901101_29_a
ボクもボクも! キリトってば
今回のクエストの最初の方から、
なんか独りで考え込んでたよね!?
ユウキ
401901101_28_a
シナリオは終わりだけど……
キリトくんにはまだ聞きたいことが
あるかな?
アスナ

さてこんな所か
キリト
401901101_24_a
………………
シリカ
401901101_23_a
それはこの人が泣き止むのを
もう少し待ってからと
致しましょう……
ラーン
401901101_22_a
さて……どうしましょうか?
私はここで滅びるのを
待つのみですが……
ラーン
401901101_21_a
……この後お二人は
どうするんですか?
シリカ
401901101_20_a
皆さんにはお手数をおかけしました
ありがとう……
ラーン
401901101_19_a
ラーン……
ううっ……ううっ……
ニエルド
401901101_18_a
あなたはそれを選び、
人間の世界に
平和を取り戻したんです……
ラーン
401901101_17_a
これでこの海域が魔物に脅かされる
こともなくなるでしょう……
ラーン
401901101_16_a
ふふっ、構わないのです
これは魔物であるにもかかわらず、
人に恋してしまった私の業
ラーン
401901101_15_a
しかしそのせいでキミの城は……
このように見るも無残な状態に……
ニエルド
401901101_14_a
あなたは人間としての道を
選ぶということでしょう……?
ラーン
401901101_13_a
箱を開けてはならないと
私は言いました
私との約束を破るということは……
ラーン
401901101_12_a
オレにはキミと共に生きる道も
あったんじゃないか……!
ニエルド
401901101_11_a
ラーン……
なぜ言ってくれなかった?
ニエルド
401901101_10_a
アスナ

ニエルド……
おじいさんになってしまいましたね
ラーン
401901101_8_a
ああ、いいぜ
もう一度ラーンと会うといい
キリト
401901101_7_a
ニエルドさん……
シリカ
401901101_6_a
お前たち……もし叶うのなら、
オレをもう一度海底城に
連れていってくれないか?
ニエルド
401901101_5_a
そうだね

もうわかってるみたいだね
ユウキ
401901001_44_a
えっ?
リーファ
401901001_43_a
まぁそれはなんとなく……
察しがついてきてるけど……
キリト
401901001_42_a
でもさ、このクエって
シナリオありきのクエなのに、
なんでユニークにしなかったんだろ?
リーファ
401901001_41_a
だろうな
どうしても横取りしたいらしいな
キリト
401901001_40_a
シリカ
401901001_39_a
キリト
401901001_38_a
あの人たち……
わたし達を追ってきてたの!?

アスナ
401901001_32_a
お前たちをどうにかしなきゃな!
そこに隠れているのは
わかってるぞ!
キリト
401901001_31_a
だがその前に……
キリト
401901001_30_a
ああ、じゃあニエルドを連れて
海底に戻ろう
それでクエは終了するはずだ
キリト
401901001_29_a
お互いの生きる道が違いすぎて、
結ばれない……ちょっと人魚姫の
お話も彷彿させますね
シリカ
401901001_28_a
やっぱりお二人は
恋仲だったんですね
シリカ
401901001_27_a
ううっ……ううっ……
オレは……なんてことを……!
ニエルド
401901001_26_a
そ、そんな……
どうしてそれを……
言わなかった……ラーン……!
ニエルド
401901001_25_a
ニエルドがどちらを選んでも
それを受け入れるつもり
だったんじゃないのか……?
キリト
401901001_24_a
そんな……でもラーンさん
そんなことは一言も……!
リーファ
401901001_23_a
ラーンと共に生きていくなら、
年を追うこともなく海底城も
滅びないという二択をな
キリト
401901001_22_a
人として生きるなら聖櫃を開き、
正しい年齢へと戻り、そして
人に仇なす魔物は滅びる……
キリト
401901001_21_a
きっと選択肢をニエルドに
委ねたんだと思う
キリト
401901001_20_a
ラーンはニエルドのことを
信頼してると言っていた
キリト
401901001_19_a
そんな……!
アスナ
401901001_18_a
真っ赤な嘘か……もしくは
魔物たちが自らの城を壊すように
動いたか……だろうな
キリト
401901001_17_a
キリトくん……
でもラーンさんは魔物に
襲われたって……!
アスナ
401901001_16_a
魔物の城を破滅させるスイッチ
だったんだと思う
キリト
401901001_15_a
これは俺の想像に過ぎないが、
恐らくは聖櫃を開くことが、
キリト
401901001_14_a
……!?
ニエルド
401901001_13_a
ラーンの海底城は……
今廃墟と化してしまった
キリト
401901001_12_a
だが彼女が海の魔物だと知ったとき、
そんなオレの浮かれた想いは、
あっと言う間に消し飛んださ
ニエルド
401901001_11_a
最初は……美しい人だと思った
このままここに留まってもいい……
そうも思ったこともある……
ニエルド
401901001_10_a
………………
ニエルド
401901001_9_a
……!
ニエルド
401901001_8_a
そ、そうですよ!
好きって気持ちはなかったんですか!
シリカ
401901001_7_a
あんたはラーンに対して、
なんの想いも抱いてなかったのか?
キリト
401901001_6_a
なあ、ニエルド
最後に聞かせてくれ
キリト
401901001_5_a
助けてくれたことは礼を言う
だがオレに言えることはもうない
ニエルド
401901001_4_a

キリト

………………
キリト
401900901_39_a
そしてこの姿になったんだ……
ニエルド
401900901_38_a
ああ、地上が既に数十年の時が
経ったことを知り、オレは
自暴自棄になってこれを開けた……
ニエルド
401900901_37_a
この箱……既に開けられてるな
ニエルド、お前が開けたのか?
キリト
401900901_36_a
いわゆる聖櫃でしょうね
リーファ
401900901_35_a
古びた小箱……
でもどこか神聖な感じがするね
アスナ
401900901_34_a
item_event_treasure_box
気づいたオレはラーンに詰め寄った
するとあいつは諦めたように笑い、
オレにこれを託したんだ
ニエルド
401900901_33_a
そんな……二人は恋仲じゃ
なかったんですね……
シリカ
401900901_32_a
諸説あるけどラーンは海の神の妻で、
波を起こして舟を転覆させてきた
って話も確かにあるよ……
リーファ
401900901_31_a
ス、スグ
そんな話があるのか?
キリト
401900901_30_a
ラーンは……あの城の奴らは
昔から漁師たちを海に引きずり
込んできた悪魔の化身なんだと!
ニエルド
401900901_29_a
騙されたオレも悪いが、
ある日オレは気づいてしまったんだ
ニエルド
401900901_28_a
亀を助けたオレをたぶらかし、
数十年もあの城に閉じ込めた……
ニエルド
401900901_27_a
え、ええっ!?
シリカ
401900901_26_a
誰があんな女のもとに戻るか!
あいつは……あいつは海の悪魔だ!
ニエルド
401900901_25_a
ドキドキ……
シリカ
401900901_24_a
な、なに!?
ラーンの所だと!?
ニエルド
401900901_23_a
なら海底城に……
ラーンの下に帰るか?
キリト
401900901_22_a
このシナリオの場合は
どうなんですかね……
シリカ
401900901_21_a
あたし昔から浦島太郎の話って、
浦島太郎と乙姫って恋仲なのかなって
思ってたんですけど、
シリカ
401900901_20_a
この辺は浦島太郎と同じだね
ユウキ
401900901_19_a
ニエルドさん……
アスナ
401900901_18_a
既に地上は数十年の月日が
流れてしまったんだ……
ニエルド
401900901_17_a
オレの父母や友人は
既に死んでしまったんだ
ニエルド
401900901_16_a
村……あんな場所に行っても
もう意味はない
ニエルド
401900901_15_a
今からあんたを村に連れていく
それでいいか?
キリト
401900901_14_a
あいつらに誘拐されたのは
災難だったが、もう大丈夫だ
キリト
401900901_13_a
……そうだ
ニエルド
401900901_12_a
えと……ニエルドだな?
キリト
401900901_11_a
言葉はわかりやすいものを
選ばないと……
キリト
401900901_10_a
高位AIを持つNPCじゃないと
プレイヤーとの柔軟な会話は
難しいからな……
キリト
401900901_9_a
ずっと黙っちゃってるけど、
どうするの?
ユウキ
401900901_8_a
うん、きっと玉手箱を
開けちゃったんだろうね……
アスナ
401900901_7_a
ニエルドさん……
お爺さんの姿だね……
リーファ
401900901_6_a
………………
ニエルド
401900901_5_a
でもニエルドを救い出せただけ、
十分だろう

あっ、逃げるつもりだよ!
ユウキ

お、置いてけそんな奴!
サラマンダーA
401900801_33_a
このジジイどうするんスか!?
サラマンダーB
401900801_32_a
こういう時は逃げるに
決まってんだろ!?
サラマンダーA
401900801_31_a
ど、どうしまスか!?
サラマンダーB
401900801_30_a
チッ……
追っ手かよ……
よくここがわかったな
サラマンダーA
401900801_29_a
ユウキ

アスナ

早く解放しなさい!

わたし達は
このクエストを通常のフローで
攻略してるプレイヤーです
アスナ

サラマンダーA
401900801_22_a
だ、誰っスか!?
サラマンダーB
401900801_21_a
なぬっ!?
サラマンダーA
401900801_20_a
ユウキ
401900801_19_a
アスナ
401900801_18_a
その話……
もう少し聞かせてくれるか?
キリト
401900801_17_a
サラマンダーA
401900801_16_a
おれは見てないスけど……
サラマンダーB
401900801_15_a
攻略BBSに書いてなかったか?
サラマンダーA
401900801_14_a
ならそもそも、
玉手箱の中身の噂って
誰が最初に言い出したんスか?
サラマンダーB
401900801_13_a
しょーがねーだろ!
このクエスト最初に手をつけた奴
じゃないとできないんだからよ!
サラマンダーA
401900801_12_a
いくらニエルドを拘束したって、
手に入らないんじゃないんスか?
サラマンダーB
401900801_11_a
そもそもおれらって、
通常のフローに則してクエスト
やってないんだから、
サラマンダーB
401900801_10_a
なあリーダー
……玉手箱にレアアイテムが
入ってるって噂……本当っスか?
サラマンダーB
401900801_9_a
るっせーな……
こいつがさっさとレアアイテム
渡せばうまく行くのによ……!
サラマンダーA
401900801_8_a
んなことやったって無駄っスよ
サラマンダーB
401900801_7_a
そいつNPCっスよね?
規定外の質問や言葉には
反応しないのが普通っス
サラマンダーB
401900801_6_a
ったく聞こえてるなら、
返事くらいしろってんだ……
サラマンダーA
401900801_5_a
……?
ニエルド
401900801_4_a
おいっ! ジジイ!
サラマンダーA
401900801_3_a
………………
ニエルド
401900801_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
おい……
サラマンダーA
401900801_1_a
うん、そうだね!
リーファ
401900701_49_a
これだけデカいとは言え
島に違いはないなら、
火山がどこかにあるはずだ
キリト
401900701_48_a
ああ、火山地帯を調べてみよう
キリト
401900701_47_a
サラマンダーって言ってたから……
アスナ
401900701_46_a
でもどこから調べるの?
リーファ
401900701_45_a
よし、この島周辺を
もう少し探ってみるか……
キリト
401900701_44_a
うん、ラーンさんも大事な物を託した
みたいなこと言ってたし、
そうなんだろうね
リーファ
401900701_43_a
玉手箱……ですよね
シリカ
401900701_42_a
そうだね
そして恐らくはニエルドさんの
持つアイテムって……
アスナ
401900701_41_a
そのすごいアイテムとやらを取らずに
アルヴヘイム本土まで戻ろうとは
考えないはずだ
キリト
401900701_40_a
いや、恐らくはまだこの辺にいる
誘拐犯も元はイベント目当てに
来たんだろうし、
キリト
401900701_39_a
どうするのお兄ちゃん?
そのさらった奴を探すために、
サラマンダー領に行ってみるとか?
リーファ
401900701_38_a
いいえ、どういたしまして!
401900701_37_a
了解だ、
ユイありがとな
キリト
401900701_36_a
ヒントはサラマンダーってことか……
キリト
401900701_35_a
この書き込みをした当人は
過去に自分がサラマンダーである事を
明かしているようです
401900701_34_a
でもいったい誰が……
ユウキ
401900701_33_a
一時的マップ化していないとしたら、
ボクたちが探してるニエルドを
誰かが誘拐したってことなの？
ユウキ
401900701_32_a
ヨツンヘイムのエクスキャリバーの
ときと同じように
ユニーククエなのかな?
アスナ
401900701_31_a
一時的マップに
なってないってことだよね……
アスナ
401900701_30_a
妙だな……
このイベントはパーティ毎に
別に発生するんじゃないのか?
キリト
401900701_29_a
ん……
それってあたし達が探してる
ニエルドってこと?
リーファ
401900701_28_a
なんだと……?
キリト
401900701_27_a
「ニエルドというNPCを拘束した
すごいアイテムを持ってるようだが、
なかなか渡そうとしない……」です
401900701_26_a
どんな内容なの?
アスナ
401900701_25_a
あっ、ちょっと待ってください
一つ変わった書き込みを
見つけましたよ
401900701_24_a
あはは……
みんな考えることは
一緒みたいですね
シリカ
401900701_23_a
後は日本がモチーフだと世界観が
崩れないかなど否定的な意見も
出ているようです
401900701_22_a
そうか……
キリト
401900701_21_a
公式情報が掲載されていないため
この島の存在自体、まだあまり
知られていないようですね……
401900701_20_a
プレイしている人数は
あまり多くないようです
401900701_19_a
……検索結果が出ました
401900701_18_a
キリト
401900701_17_a
なるほど、ユイちゃんに
他のプレイヤーの攻略状況を
探ってもらうんだね
リーファ
401900701_16_a
はい、検索しますね……
少しお待ちください
401900701_15_a
ネットのBBSやSNSで
この島についてなにか
書き込みはあるかな?
キリト
401900701_14_a
はい、パパ
どうしましたか?
401900701_13_a
あっ、そうだ
ユイ、今いいか?
キリト
401900701_12_a
うーん……
キリト
401900701_11_a
そうだな
闇雲に探してどうにかなる
訳じゃなさそうだ……
キリト
401900701_10_a
もっとも空から見た限り
この周囲だと人が住んでるのって
この村だけみたいだったけど……
アスナ
401900701_9_a
この島すごく大きいから、
もっと探索範囲を広げてみる?
アスナ
401900701_8_a
確かにクエスト攻略って行き詰まると
結構テンション落ちちゃいますよね
シリカ
401900701_7_a
ここで敵でも
ドバーンと出てきてくれれば、
色々と発散できるのにね～
ユウキ
401900701_6_a
うん……
あたしちょっと疲れたよ～
リーファ
401900701_5_a
村人全員に話しかけてみても、
なんの変化もなしか……

bg_event_seashore
うーん……
アスナ
401900701_1_a
はい!
シリカ
401900601_25_a
ああ、地上に戻って
なにか変化がないか、
確認してみよう
キリト
401900601_24_a
でもラーンさんに出会ったことで、
もしかしたらフラグが回収されて、
別イベントが起きてるかもしれない
アスナ
401900601_23_a
でもどうしよう
ニエルドの行くアテなんて、
あたし達じゃわからないよ?
リーファ
401900601_22_a
ただ昔話のツギハギ部分を
独自に解釈して補てんするなんてのは
あるのかもしれないな
キリト
401900601_21_a
さすがにそれはないと思う
あくまでカーディナルが自動で
シナリオも生成してるだけだからな
キリト
401900601_20_a
キリトさんはその謎が
今回のクエストで明かされるって
いうんですか?
シリカ
401900601_19_a
いやまぁ、それは確かに
そうなんだけどな……
キリト
401900601_18_a
ボクはハッピーエンドの方が
絶対にいいと思うけどな～
ユウキ
401900601_17_a
ちょっと作者の意図が不明な所が
多いというか、
モヤっとしてる要素が多いね
アスナ
401900601_16_a
あはは……言われてみればそうだね
昔話って教訓とか寓話も多いけど、
浦島太郎に限って言えば、
アスナ
401900601_15_a
謎や乙姫の意図が解明されてるなら、
別にハッピーエンドじゃなくても
構わないんだけど……
キリト
401900601_14_a
確かにそうだね
ユウキ
401900601_13_a
あの物語の主人公って、
ただ不幸になっただけだろ?
キリト
401900601_12_a
結局宴とかで一時的な楽しみは
味わえたかもしれないけど、
キリト
401900601_11_a
玉手箱はどういうつもりで
浦島太郎に渡したんだろう……
キリト
401900601_10_a
そもそも乙姫は感謝してたのに、
なんでなにも言わず竜宮城に何年も
浦島太郎を留めたんだろう
キリト
401900601_9_a
浦島太郎に違和感……ですか?
普通の昔話みたいに思えますけど
シリカ
401900601_8_a
いや、日本の昔話の方さ
あの話って初めて知ったときから、
なんか違和感があったんだよな
キリト
401900601_7_a
それってニエルドの
居場所ってこと?
リーファ
401900601_6_a
浦島太郎について
ちょっと考えてたんだ……
キリト
401900601_5_a
キリトくん、どうしたの?

キリト
401900601_1_a
そのはずだ……
キリト
401900501_27_a
なるほど……
じゃあ、やっぱりニエルドは
地上のどこかにいるんだよね?
リーファ
401900501_26_a
うん、そうだね……
アスナ
401900501_25_a
現時点では今以上の情報は
なにも持っていないと思う
キリト
401900501_24_a
スグ……
この人はクエストナビ用のNPCだ
キリト
401900501_23_a
乙姫様……じゃなかった、
ラーンさんにもっと質問した方が
いいんじゃない?
リーファ
401900501_22_a
えっ、お兄ちゃん
もう帰っちゃっていいの?
リーファ
401900501_21_a
そうか、わかった
邪魔したな
キリト
401900501_20_a
………………
キリト
401900501_19_a
あれってもしかして……
アスナ
401900501_18_a
ニエルドなら……
あれを守り抜いてくれるはず……
そう信じています……
ラーン
401900501_17_a
ラーンさんはそれがわかって
いたから、そうなる前にあらかじめ
ニエルドさんを地上に戻した……?
シリカ
401900501_16_a
ええと、話をまとめると……
こんな酷い有様になっちゃったのは
魔物のせいで……
リーファ
401900501_15_a
見てのとおり、この城がかつて
誇っていた栄華は……
既に失われたのです
ラーン
401900501_14_a
魔物?
逃がした……?
キリト
401900501_13_a
そうなる前に……
私が彼を逃がしたのです……
ラーン
401900501_12_a
この地は魔物によって
破壊し尽くされました……
ラーン
401900501_11_a
ニエルドは……
もうここにはいません
ラーン
401900501_10_a
ラーンさん、ニエルドは
まだここにいますか? それとも
もう出立した後ですか……?
アスナ
401900501_9_a
うん、北欧神話の海の女神様だよ
乙姫様的役回りって考えて、
大丈夫だと思う
リーファ
401900501_8_a
リーファ……
ラーンってのは……
キリト
401900501_7_a
私はラーンと言います
この海底城の……主でした
???
401900501_6_a
突然押しかけてすまない
あなたの名前は……

???
401900501_1_a
行けばわかるさ
昔話のとおりなら
乙姫的なキャラもいるはずだからな
キリト
401900401_24_a
ちょっと嫌な予感がするね
あそこにニエルドはいるのか、
それとももう出て行った後なのか……
アスナ
401900401_23_a
まるで廃墟だね……
リーファ
401900401_22_a
あの朽ちてる様子……
とてもタイやヒラメが
舞い踊ってる感じじゃないね……
ユウキ
401900401_21_a
おとぎ話の夢の国みたいなのを
想像してたんですけど……
シリカ
401900401_20_a
ほ、ホントですね……
もっとこう……
海の底でキラキラ輝くような、
シリカ
401900401_19_a
でも……あれ?
なんか様子がおかしくない?
ユウキ
401900401_18_a
わあ、ホントだ!

401900401_17_a
シリカ
401900401_16_a
アスナ
401900401_15_a
みんな見えてきたぞ
たぶんあそこにある建物が
竜宮城だ
キリト
401900401_14_a
わ、わかってるって……おっ
キリト
401900401_13_a
キリトくんは
見ちゃダメですからね～!
アスナ
401900401_12_a
………………
キリト
401900401_11_a
も～!
シリカまで止めてったらー!
リーファ
401900401_10_a
なるほど……
脂肪は浮くから素潜りは苦手と……
シリカ
401900401_9_a
ちょ、ユウキ!?
胸つつきながら
ニヤニヤするの止めてよ!
リーファ
401900401_8_a
多分このせいじゃないかなぁ……
ユウキ
401900401_7_a
スグは運動神経バツグンなのに、
なぜか泳ぎだけは
苦手なんだよな……
キリト
401900401_6_a
あたしの泳ぐ速度に合わせて
もらっちゃって……すみません
リーファ
401900401_5_a
は、はい
前に比べたらだいぶマシには
なったんですけど……

よし、これで呼吸することも
会話も可能だ
行ってみよう!

オース・ナーザ・フョール・

アスナ

うん、水中呼吸魔法だよね
アスナ
401900301_20_a
そうだね
じゃあアスナさんお願いしても
いいですか?
リーファ
401900301_19_a
ああ、竜宮城だな
海に潜って探してみるか……
キリト
401900301_18_a
浦島太郎と言えば……
もう一つの舞台は海の底だよね
アスナ
401900301_17_a
これ以上この村で調査しても
新しい情報は出てこなさそうだけど、
これからどうする?
ユウキ
401900301_16_a
彼は、ニエルドは今どこに……
それともこれから海から戻って
来るんでしょうか……?
シリカ
401900301_15_a
だと思います
浦島太郎は玉手箱を空けて老人に
なってしまうはずですけど……
シリカ
401900301_14_a
恐らく設定としては、
彼が玉手箱を持って帰ってきた頃って
ことだよね?
ユウキ
401900301_13_a
彼がいた時から
数十年経過してるってことだから、
ユウキ
401900301_12_a
そこはアレンジしてるみたいです
リーファ
401900301_11_a
ですね
ニエルドは北欧神話の漁に
関係する神ですが、
リーファ
401900301_10_a
うん、有名な話……
浦島太郎伝説だよね
アスナ
401900301_9_a
以来忽然と姿を消したって話は
みんな聞いたよな?
キリト
401900301_8_a
ある日ニエルドは海亀がイジメられて
いるのを発見し、それを助けた……
キリト
401900301_7_a
ああ……この村には数十年前に
ニエルドって名前の青年がいた
キリト
401900301_6_a
あはは……
それになんの昔話がモチーフかも
わかりましたしね
シリカ
401900301_5_a
ふーっ、とりあえず村人たちから
襲われなくてよかったね
ユウキ
401900301_4_a

みんな、調査お疲れさま
アスナ
401900301_1_a
アスナ
401900201_19_a
さっさと降りてみようぜ
キリト
401900201_18_a
ああ、まあでも
やっぱ上から見てるだけじゃ
なにも掴めないからな
キリト
401900201_17_a
それがわかればクエストの
ヒントになる可能性もあるもんね
アスナ
401900201_16_a
日本の昔話や神話にも
色んなお話がありますからね
シリカ
401900201_15_a
この島を作っているんだとしたら……
今回のエピソードはなんなんだろうな
って思ったんだ
キリト
401900201_14_a
カーディナルの自動生成クエストが
それこそ日本の神話や昔話を
ネット上から集めて、
キリト
401900201_13_a
キリトくん、どうしたの?
アスナ
401900201_12_a
昔話……か
キリト
401900201_11_a
そうです
そうです!
リーファ
401900201_10_a
それこそ昔話みたいに、
わたし達を鬼とか悪魔と
勘違いしちゃうってこと?
アスナ
401900201_9_a
あたし達はこの世界だと妖精だから、
突然襲われたりするかも……
リーファ
401900201_8_a
あのNPCさん達って、昔話に
出てきそうな日本人の服で、しかも
あれって人間アバターですよね？
シリカ
401900201_7_a
そ、そうですね
でも大丈夫でしょうか?
シリカ
401900201_6_a
海沿いに村があるね
漁村かな?
ちょっと降りてみようか
アスナ
401900201_5_a
ホントに大きい……
島じゃないよこれは……
ユウキ
401900201_4_a
シリカ
401900201_3_a
キリト
401900201_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
あっ、見えてきたよ
あれが噂の島だね
リーファ
401900201_1_a
う、うん
分かったよ……
リーファ
401900101_29_a
とにかくその場所に行ってみよう
スグ案内してもらえるか?
キリト
401900101_28_a
ま、まあ大したことじゃないんだ
今は、忘れてくれ
キリト
401900101_27_a
お兄ちゃん、その言い方、
なんか気になるんですけど……
リーファ
401900101_26_a
キリトくんどうしたの?
アスナ
401900101_25_a
あっ、いやこれはいいや
キリト
401900101_24_a
うーん……確かに気になるな
一番可能性として高いのは……
キリト
401900101_23_a
でもそういうアップデートって、
大体オマケ程度とか
小ネタの場合が多いから……
ユウキ
401900101_22_a
実装先行型の場合もありますよね?
シリカ
401900101_21_a
はい、気になるのは、
いまだにインフォメーションが
ないことなんです
リーファ
401900101_20_a
これからクエストも
沢山実装されるんだろうけど……
アスナ
401900101_19_a
そうだね
新フィールドってことなら、
アスナ
401900101_18_a
ここまで大がかりなのは……
なかったな
ちょっと不自然なくらいだ
キリト
401900101_17_a
これまでの日本の季節イベントとか
けっこうあったわけだけど、
キリト
401900101_16_a
まあALOは北欧神話がメインだが、
他の神話ネタも拾って作られてる
からな……
キリト
401900101_15_a
うわぁ……離れ島とはいえ、
西洋ファンタジーとはずいぶん
かけ離れてるね、あはは……
ユウキ
401900101_14_a
し、しかもかなり昔の服装ですよ
平安時代とかその辺りの……
シリカ
401900101_13_a
この村人っぽい人たちの格好……
こ、これって日本人!?
アスナ
401900101_12_a
えっ!?
キリト
401900101_11_a
それを撮影した画像がこれで……
リーファ
401900101_10_a
はい、島に降りたプレイヤーの話で、
複数のNPCが暮らしている事も
わかってて……
リーファ
401900101_9_a
そう考えた方が良さそうだね
けっこうな大きさだって聞いたよ
アスナ
401900101_8_a
新実装のエリアとか?
ユウキ
401900101_7_a
そんな場所に
島なんてあったんですね
シリカ
401900101_6_a
ポツンと島が出来上がってるのが
発見されたんだって
リーファ
401900101_5_a
サラマンダー領地からずっと
南下したところにある海に、

キリト

gulp
M-Me too...
And we always will be!
Lisbeth
401801201_29_a
Hehe, but really, Liz, thank you.
I'm glad you're my friend.
Asuna
401801201_28_a
S-Stop it... You're making my
eyes leak!
Lisbeth
401801201_27_a
And that my friends are always
with me, so there's no need
to worry.
Asuna
401801201_26_a
there's happiness.
Asuna
401801201_25_a
No... I mean that after all the
pain and hardship...
Asuna
401801201_24_a
You mean that you were able to
make the New Year's food
all right in the end?
Lisbeth
401801201_23_a
Yeah... Heh, I wish I could tell
past-me...
Asuna
401801201_22_a
Really? That makes this extra
worth the while!
Lisbeth
401801201_21_a
Now that I finally have the right
recipes, I'll be able to make this
next year too--without questing.
Asuna
401801201_20_a
Yeah...
Asuna
401801201_19_a
Well, I guess that means we can
rest easy knowing we've made up
for our past failure in SAO.
Lisbeth
401801201_18_a
Hehe, I think that means
it's really good.
Asuna
401801201_17_a
Asuna
401801201_16_a
They aren't even chewing their
food. Just inhaling it...like a
pair of vacuums...
Lisbeth
401801201_15_a
Klein
401801201_14_a
I don't think I've ever had
konbumaki this delicious!
Kirito
401801201_13_a
Kirito
401801201_12_a
Duuude, this kazunoko is the bomb!
Klein
401801201_11_a
Sinon
401801201_9_a
Heh heh heh. So what are we all
waiting for? Let's dig in!
Lisbeth
401801201_8_a
Asuna
401801201_10_a
Hehe, it's all thanks to your
hard work... Especially you, Liz.
Asuna
401801201_7_a
You wouldn't even get this level
of quality in the real world...
Sinon
401801201_6_a
It looks so good! I can't believe
you were able to make this so
perfectly in ALO!
Leafa
401801201_5_a
Yaaaaay! Mommy, you're amazing!
Yui
401801201_4_a

Ta-daaa! I present to you
an absolutely flawless
New Year's feast!
Asuna
401801201_1_a
Hehe, well, alright then...
Thank you...
Lisbeth
401801101_27_a
Ha ha, no one's expecting anything
of the sort.
Kirito
401801101_26_a
All this flattery isn't gonna get
you a discount or anything at
my shop, you know!
Lisbeth
401801101_25_a
Y-You guys... You can't all
feel that way!
Lisbeth
401801101_24_a
Yeah, no doubt about that.
Agil
401801101_23_a
Totally!
Strea
401801101_22_a
Hear, hear!
Philia
401801101_21_a
Yeah. You're definitely our MVP
for this quest, Liz.
Kirito
401801101_20_a
What are you talking about? You've
been a huge help this whole time!
Asuna
401801101_19_a
I'm just glad I can finally do
something useful.
Lisbeth
401801101_18_a
Hehehe, I made it. Blacksmithing
skills for the win!
Lisbeth
401801101_17_a
Whoa, that's one big net! Leave it
to you to be the prepared one,
Liz. Where'd you even get it?
Kirito
401801101_16_a
it'd be nearly impossible to catch
them one-by-one with a rod. That's
why I brought this!
Lisbeth
401801101_15_a
Hold on a second. We need to get
several of these fish, and they're
so quick...
Lisbeth
401801101_14_a
I'll get my rod out!
Strea
401801101_13_a
Then let's grab 'em before we lose
sight of them again!
Lisbeth
401801101_12_a
Now I feel kind of bad... But we
do need the fish too, so...
Asuna
401801101_11_a
It only came here for a bite to
eat, but we scared it off. I don't
think it'll come back.
Agil
401801101_10_a
Strea, wait! There's no need
to chase after it!
Kirito
401801101_9_a
Hey, it's running away!
Strea
401801101_8_a
RAAAAAAAUUUGGHHHH!
Dragon
401801101_7_a
I don't think so...
Kirito
401801101_6_a
Did we beat it?!
Philia
401801101_5_a
Kirito
401801101_4_a
Philia
401801101_3_a
Lisbeth
401801101_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
GRRAAAAAGGGHHH!
Dragon
401801101_1_a
Yeah, let's do this!
Asuna
401801001_42_a
I don't think we'll be able to run
from this battle... Get ready,
everyone!
Kirito
401801001_41_a
It must be... Look at that shadow
on the clouds! It's coming this
way!
Lisbeth
401801001_40_a
The one with a penchant
for seafood...?
Agil
401801001_39_a
Is that...the dragon?!
Asuna
401801001_38_a
RRAAAAAAUUUGGGHHHH!
???
401801001_37_a
What's that roaring sound...?
Kirito
401801001_36_a
What is it, Kirito?
Lisbeth
401801001_35_a
Wait!
Kirito
401801001_34_a
Alriiiight! Let's go get us some
nuliban!
Lisbeth
401801001_33_a
That was amazing! You shattered
that drift ice into a million
pieces!
Asuna
401801001_32_a
Whoaaaa!
Kirito
401801001_31_a
Hiiiyyyaaaaa!!
Agil
401801001_30_a
Ready, Agil?
One, two...three!
Strea
401801001_29_a
Hell to the yeah!
Agil
401801001_28_a
You really think you can do it?
Kirito
401801001_27_a
The two of you should be able to
break up this drift ice no sweat!
Lisbeth
401801001_26_a
Oh, that's right! Gnomes are the
strongest of all the races!
Lisbeth
401801001_25_a
Hehe, yeah, we got this!
Strea
401801001_24_a
Heh... Guess this is where us
Gnomes come in.
Agil
401801001_23_a
That's not good! This ice is super
thick. We'll never be able to
track them through it...
Lisbeth
401801001_22_a
Huh?
Kirito
401801001_21_a
A huge piece of drift ice just
floated right over the school of
nuliban...
Asuna
401801001_20_a
What is it, Asuna?!
Lisbeth
401801001_19_a
Oh no!
Asuna
401801001_18_a
Grrr... It'd be one thing if this
was treasure we were looking for,
but fish are a whole other story!
Kirito
401801001_17_a
Hehe, what's the matter, Kirito?
I thought you were supposed to
be a Spriggan too!
Philia
401801001_16_a
Unbelievable...
Kirito
401801001_15_a
Really? Awesome!
Philia
401801001_14_a
Way to go, Philia!
Lisbeth
401801001_13_a
Oh! You're right! There's a whole
school of nuliban over there!
Lisbeth
401801001_12_a
Let me see...
Lisbeth
401801001_11_a
I just thought I saw some fishy
shadows under the surface swim
that way.
Philia
401801001_10_a
Hahaha, no. I don't even think
something like that exists.
Philia
401801001_9_a
Whoa, are you saying your treasure
hunter's intuition is acting up?
Agil
401801001_8_a
Just a hunch...
Philia
401801001_7_a
What makes you say that?
Asuna
401801001_6_a
I feel like over there is the best
spot to fish for some nuliban.
Philia
401801001_5_a
What is it, Philia?
Kirito
401801001_4_a
Asuna
401801001_3_a
Kirito
401801001_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
Hmmm...
Philia
401801001_1_a
Yeah! She's right! Come on, guys,
we can do this!
Asuna
401800901_28_a
W-Well, duh! It's another chance
to make up for what happened
in SAO, after all!
Lisbeth
401800901_27_a
Geez, Liz, you've really been
kicking things into high gear
for this quest.
Kirito
401800901_26_a
Don't be such a baby! We're so
close to getting everything we
need. Don't chicken out now!
Lisbeth
401800901_25_a
No way am I doing that!
Strea
401800901_24_a
Y-Y-You're joking, right! It's
the middle of winter! The water's
subzero!
Strea
401800901_23_a
Yeah... They could be under a bit
of drift ice, so worst case,
we have to dive in to get them.
Lisbeth
401800901_22_a
Right. Eyes on the water, guys.
Philia
401800901_21_a
Alright, we should be coming up on
a school of nuliban soon.
Kirito
401800901_20_a
Ahaha...
Kirito
401800901_19_a
Gaaaah! Hands off the merchandise,
Liz!
Strea
401800901_18_a
It means you've got way too
much skin exposed!
Lisbeth
401800901_17_a
What's that supposed to mean?!
Strea
401800901_16_a
Well, just look at what you're
wearing...
Lisbeth
401800901_15_a
Whaaat? Then why am I cold?!
I'm a Gnome just like Agil!
Strea
401800901_14_a
Well, the Leprechauns do live
in the northern part of the
continent.
Kirito
401800901_13_a
You guys keep saying it's cold,
but I'm not feeling it.
Lisbeth
401800901_12_a
It must be the same for
Leprechauns, then.
Lisbeth
401800901_11_a
I guess that kind of immunizes
you to the cold a bit.
Kirito
401800901_10_a
The Gnome's territory is in
the north, after all.
Kirito
401800901_9_a
Nope, I'm used to it.
Agil
401800901_8_a
Aren't you cold at all, Agil?
Asuna
401800901_7_a
You guys hanging in there? Don't
freeze up on us when the dragon
rears its ugly head!
Agil
401800901_6_a
Seriously...
Kirito
401800901_5_a
Well, we are pretty far north...
See, there's even some drift ice!
Maaan, it is reaaally cold...
Philia
401800901_4_a
Kirito
401800901_3_a
Philia
401800901_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
Brrrrr, i-it's freeeeziiiiing!
Strea
401800901_1_a
You got it!
Asuna
401800801_24_a
Yeah. Then let's get going. This
is the last hurdle until we can
have our feast and eat it too!
Kirito
401800801_23_a
Heh, that's for sure. But it's
pretty cool to think that we're
so close to being done...
Asuna
401800801_22_a
I can't believe we're gonna have
to fight a big baddie like that
for the last stretch...
Lisbeth
401800801_21_a
It's been such smooth sailing
up until this point, too!
Lisbeth
401800801_20_a
But there's that dragon
to contend with...
Lisbeth
401800801_19_a
So we have to go up there if we
want to catch some...
Philia
401800801_18_a
I guess fish like the nuliban do
migrate up there for the winter...
Kirito
401800801_17_a
Apparently it's been gorging
itself on the big fish up there
that it likes so much.
Agil
401800801_16_a
There's this rumor going around
about a dragon terrorizing that
area right now...
Agil
401800801_15_a
Something wrong, Agil?
Kirito
401800801_14_a
What? That place...?
Agil
401800801_13_a
The waters of the northern ocean.
Lisbeth
401800801_12_a
Where can we get it?
Philia
401800801_11_a
Sounds like we better grab our
fishing gear.
Agil
401800801_10_a
Yeah. Both of those require
nuliban fish.
Asuna
401800801_9_a
Konbumaki and kazunoko, right?
Kirito
401800801_8_a
Yeah, I'd say so.
All that's left is...um...
Lisbeth
401800801_7_a
So now we've got ten dishes all
set. Are we on schedule?
Philia
401800801_6_a
Hehe, it's nothing, really...
Asuna
401800801_5_a
It's got just the right amount
of sweetness. I could eat these
all day!
Strea
401800801_4_a
Kirito
401800801_3_a
Asuna
401800801_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Yuuuuum! This is so tasty!
Strea
401800801_1_a
Okay!
Asuna
401800701_24_a
Alright, so now that we've got the
actual recipe, we should let
Kirito and the others know.
Lisbeth
401800701_23_a
Yeah, you're right! We have to
focus!
Asuna
401800701_22_a
We just barely got started on this
quest. This is only the first
dish!
Lisbeth
401800701_21_a
Hehe, don't thank me yet.
Lisbeth
401800701_20_a
Liz, I...
Thank you...
Asuna
401800701_19_a
That's why I kind of grabbed
the reigns on all of this.
Lisbeth
401800701_18_a
I don't want that to happen again.
Lisbeth
401800701_17_a
I can still see the disappointment
on your face when those
recipes failed...
Lisbeth
401800701_16_a
Well...yeah.
Lisbeth
401800701_15_a
and I hope this doesn't come off
as me being self-centered, but...
are you doing this for me?
Asuna
401800701_14_a
Your plan of attack is working out
really well. I just can't help
wondering...
Asuna
401800701_13_a
Yeah?
Lisbeth
401800701_12_a
Um, Liz...
Asuna
401800701_11_a
Hehe.
Lisbeth
401800701_10_a
Absolutely.
Asuna
401800701_9_a
It feels good to finally figure
all this out! We'll get it right
for sure this time!
Lisbeth
401800701_8_a
Ooh, okay, I just didn't use
enough last time...
Asuna
401800701_7_a
A recipe for kuromame...
Ah, glossa extract, okay...
Asuna
401800701_6_a
What do you think, Asuna?
Lisbeth
401800701_5_a
...
Asuna
401800701_4_a
Lisbeth
401800701_3_a
Asuna
401800701_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
These are the ingredients I need
for the first dish.
Chef NPC
401800701_1_a
Hehehe.
Lisbeth
401800601_37_a
Ha ha, why am I not surprised
you've thought that far ahead?
Kirito
401800601_36_a
and the ingredient-gathering team.
Lisbeth
401800601_35_a
Hehehe, why thank you.
Alright, I'm gonna split us up
into the chef-visiting team...
Lisbeth
401800601_34_a
Leave it to the blacksmith to work
out the best way for a lot of
moving parts to fit together.
Kirito
401800601_33_a
Sounds good to me.
Agil
401800601_32_a
You got it!
Lisbeth
401800601_31_a
Ooh, I know what that means! We
split up so everything gets done
more efficiently!
Strea
401800601_30_a
So close and yet so far. Maybe it
is worth getting the ingredients
we know about first, just in case.
Philia
401800601_29_a
and it could just be we were wrong
about the amounts to use.
Asuna
401800601_28_a
We must have had at least some
of the correct ingredients,
Asuna
401800601_27_a
It actually ended up being the
recipe that was off, not the
ingredients.
Asuna
401800601_26_a
Why? You messed it up that time.
Kirito
401800601_25_a
Then I think we should get all
the ingredients we used back then.
Lisbeth
401800601_24_a
and ALO did copy pretty much
everything from SAO's servers.
Kirito
401800601_23_a
Yeah. The core program
is the same,
Kirito
401800601_22_a
But there's plenty of overlapping
equipment and items and mobs
and stuff like that, right?
Lisbeth
401800601_21_a
ALO and SAO are different games...
Lisbeth
401800601_20_a
What is it?
Kirito
401800601_19_a
Ah--hold on just a second.
Lisbeth
401800601_18_a
Right.
Asuna
401800601_17_a
They'll tell us the ingredients
that they need, right?
Strea
401800601_16_a
Alright, then let's hurry up and
pay a visit to those chefs!
Strea
401800601_15_a
I just need to see it done once
so I know what I'm doing.
Asuna
401800601_14_a
Yeah, then you can practice making
everything on your own later!
Philia
401800601_13_a
Oh! And I can totally take notes
on the kinds of ingredients
they use!
Asuna
401800601_12_a
Hehe, I guess so.
Asuna
401800601_11_a
Even if the NPCs are the ones
making it, it's still another
chance to eat it in VR.
Kirito
401800601_10_a
Well, then this is kind of a
second chance.
Kirito
401800601_9_a
Hehe, that's just how you are.
Lisbeth
401800601_8_a
I still kind of wish I'd been
able to make it work...
Asuna
401800601_7_a
It was the right call not to have
it as the main course, but it made
for one heck of a joke.
Agil
401800601_6_a
Hehe, yeah.
Asuna
401800601_5_a
No, we put it out just for laughs.
Everyone made the weirdest faces
eating it, but it was hilarious!
Lisbeth
401800601_4_a
Asuna
401800601_3_a
Lisbeth
401800601_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
So then you didn't end up serving
any of the New Year's food you
made?
Kirito
401800601_1_a
Totally. Don't even worry
about it.
Agil
401800501_25_a
Not at all! I had a blast!
Lisbeth
401800501_24_a
Sorry this turned out to be such
a waste of time...
Asuna
401800501_23_a
Yeah, you are. Well, I guess we're
going with Plan B.
Agil
401800501_22_a
Y-You're not bragging!
You're an amazing cook!
Lisbeth
401800501_21_a
Then again, maybe this isn't a
good time for me to brag...
Ehehe...
Asuna
401800501_20_a
That's the best thing. I'll make
my specialty. That's sure to be
a crowd-pleaser.
Asuna
401800501_19_a
But...
Lisbeth
401800501_18_a
Yeah... We can't feed any of this
to people
it's terrible. I guess
we just have to admit defeat.
Asuna
401800501_17_a
What do you want to do, Asuna...?
Lisbeth
401800501_16_a
...
Asuna
401800501_15_a
We still have time to whip up some
normal food, right?
Agil
401800501_14_a
No, that's not what I want! But
maybe we oughta think about
changing the menu at least...
Agil
401800501_13_a
D-Don't say that! What are we
supposed to do? Cancel the party?
We already sent out the invites!
Lisbeth
401800501_12_a
Hmmm... And I guess we're pretty
much out of time, since New Year's
is right around the corner.
Agil
401800501_11_a
Yeah... If this is any indication,
I don't think any of it is going
to turn out fine...
Asuna
401800501_10_a
Could be... Man, it really is hard
to get the recipes for these
things right...
Agil
401800501_9_a
Y-Yeah... Maybe the ingredients
we got weren't all that great...
Lisbeth
401800501_8_a
No worries... Someone's gotta
be the guinea pig, right?
Agil
401800501_7_a
I-I'm really sorry... I can't
believe I made you taste-test all
this weird stuff...
Asuna
401800501_6_a
gnaw
... I can't even bite
through this, it's so tough...
Lisbeth
401800501_5_a
If this weren't VR, I'd be worried
about getting cavities!
Agil
401800501_4_a
Asuna
401800501_3_a
Lisbeth
401800501_2_a
bg_05_agil_shop
Whoa...!
This... This is so sugary!
Agil
401800501_1_a
Still, thank you!
Asuna
401800401_29_a
Exactly.
Agil
401800401_28_a
Aw, come on, that's what friends
are for.
Lisbeth
401800401_27_a
You two are the best!
I owe you one!
Asuna
401800401_26_a
I'll get my hands on anything and
everything that looks like it'll
be useful.
Agil
401800401_25_a
Then I can procure whatever items
we'll need.
Agil
401800401_24_a
so, Asuna, you focus on making the
recipe. I'll use my connections to
get new info on ingredients.
Lisbeth
401800401_23_a
There's really no reason for me or
Agil to be involved in the actual
cooking part,
Lisbeth
401800401_22_a
Alright, so let's figure out
who's in charge of what.
Lisbeth
401800401_21_a
Thank you! Both of you!
Asuna
401800401_20_a
Well, might as well try. What've
we got to lose?
Agil
401800401_19_a
I bet being able to eat it again
would really lift their spirits...
Lisbeth
401800401_18_a
It's definitely worth a shot. I'm
sure everyone really misses
that kind of food.
Lisbeth
401800401_17_a
Since that's all it takes to
recreate food from the real
world, I'm sure there's a way...
Asuna
401800401_16_a
But cooking in this world just
takes getting the ingredients and
combining them well enough.
Asuna
401800401_15_a
Yeah, I'm no chef.
Agil
401800401_14_a
If you can't make it, there's no
way either of us can manage that.
Lisbeth
401800401_13_a
Um... Well, I've never really
cooked holiday food myself, but
I could try...
Asuna
401800401_12_a
I'm in. But how are we gonna
make all that stuff?
Lisbeth
401800401_11_a
Hm... I guess it is that time
of year again...
Agil
401800401_10_a
What do you think about cooking
a nice holiday meal together?
Asuna
401800401_9_a
But this year I was thinking it
would be nice to celebrate.
Asuna
401800401_8_a
We'd all just gotten here around
this time last year, so we didn't
have much time to spare...
Asuna
401800401_7_a
O-Okay... So, New Year's is
coming up...
Asuna
401800401_6_a
You're the vice commander of the
Knights of the Blood Oath. No need
to beat around the bush.
Lisbeth
401800401_5_a
Huh? What is it?
Agil
401800401_4_a
Lisbeth
401800401_3_a
Agil
401800401_2_a
bg_05_agil_shop
Hey, Agil, Liz, can I ask you
something?
Asuna
401800401_1_a
Hehe, alright.
Lisbeth
401800301_33_a
This sounds like a good story!
Don't just gloss over all the
juicy details!
Philia
401800301_32_a
I never knew about that.
Kirito
401800301_31_a
But it's something we look back
on and laugh about now.
Agil
401800301_30_a
It...didn't go well. The flavors
were all wrong...
Asuna
401800301_29_a
It was the second New Year we
spent in SAO... We tried making
some holiday fare.
Lisbeth
401800301_28_a
That's right. You guys
weren't there.
Lisbeth
401800301_27_a
What are you talking about?
Strea
401800301_26_a
...?
Kirito
401800301_25_a
Oh, now you got me going
down memory lane too.
Agil
401800301_24_a
Hehe, oh yeah.
I remember that...
Asuna
401800301_23_a
sigh
... But, you know, this
really brings me back.
Lisbeth
401800301_22_a
Holiday meals are special, after
all. They require days of prep and
can't be rushed...
Asuna
401800301_21_a
Yeah... None of the usual methods
would work.
Asuna
401800301_20_a
True. No way would your average
cooking skill be enough to make
all of that...
Philia
401800301_19_a
There are lots of different dishes
that take time and energy to
prepare, same as in real life.
Kirito
401800301_18_a
It does sound like a lot
of work...
Strea
401800301_17_a
No problems here. I'm cool to
see this thing through to the end.
Agil
401800301_16_a
Yeah, a really tough one.
Everyone still on board?
Lisbeth
401800301_15_a
Sounds like some sort of
culinary matching game.
Philia
401800301_14_a
and give them to the corresponding
NPC chefs, who will then make
the dishes for us.
Asuna
401800301_13_a
Instead of getting everything
at once, we have to collect
the ingredients...
Asuna
401800301_12_a
Datemaki, kurikinton, konbumaki,
kazunoko, tazukuri...
Asuna
401800301_11_a
Ha ha, yeah. You guys still have
to tell us what this quest is
about.
Agil
401800301_10_a
Hold your horses, Strea.
Philia
401800301_9_a
Let's hurry up and make this
feast! I'm staaaarving!
Strea
401800301_8_a
Klein's busy with other stuff,
so this is everyone.
Kirito
401800301_7_a
Hiya!
Lisbeth
401800301_6_a
Hey guys!
Strea
401800301_5_a
Heya!
Philia
401800301_4_a
Strea
401800301_3_a
Philia
401800301_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Yo.
Agil
401800301_1_a
Yeah. Then I'll message Silica
and some other friends.
Lisbeth
401800201_21_a
We should message Klein and the
others. I bet they'd want to
do this too.
Kirito
401800201_20_a
Hehe, I knew you'd say that.
Lisbeth
401800201_19_a
Yeah, it sounds like it could be
fun. Plus, I really want a taste
of all that food!
Kirito
401800201_18_a
Absolutely!
Asuna
401800201_17_a
Bingo. You two down to take on
this quest or what?
Lisbeth
401800201_16_a
So then you get all this
ready-made as a reward?
Kirito
401800201_15_a
Right? I told you I hit
the jackpot!
Lisbeth
401800201_14_a
No way could you make this
on your own...
Asuna
401800201_13_a
It looks like a full course dinner
from a five-star restaurant! Even
served in fancy lacquer boxes!
Asuna
401800201_12_a
Whoa...!
Kirito
401800201_11_a
Well, maybe if they had your skill
level, Asuna. But here, look. A
picture's worth a thousand words.
Lisbeth
401800201_10_a
If it's food, it must be something
anyone could make in VR...
Asuna
401800201_9_a
I suppose New Year's is coming
up pretty soon...
Asuna
401800201_8_a
It's about the reward you get for
one of the seasonal quests,
something called "New Year Feast."
Lisbeth
401800201_7_a
Nope. It doesn't have anything to
do with blacksmithing...
Lisbeth
401800201_6_a
Did someone tell you where you can
mine some super-rare ore or
something?
Kirito
401800201_5_a
What do you mean?
Asuna
401800201_4_a
Kirito
401800201_3_a
Asuna
401800201_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
So I pretty much landed
the jackpot with this...
Lisbeth
401800201_1_a
Alright.
Asuna
401800101_25_a
Let's go somewhere a little
quieter.
Lisbeth
401800101_24_a
Hahaha, I was only joking.
But I don't want to tell you
with all these people around.
Lisbeth
401800101_23_a
Okay, "Argo," name your price.
Kirito
401800101_22_a
Now, Asu, how am I supposed ta
make a livin' just givin' away
info fer free?
Lisbeth
401800101_21_a
Ooh, and what was that?
Asuna
401800101_20_a
I even heard this juicy tidbit you
won't find on the tips and tricks
sites or on the forums.
Lisbeth
401800101_19_a
And because there are so many
people here, it's a great place
to pick up new info too.
Lisbeth
401800101_18_a
Hahaha... Anyway, it's pretty cool
how they've captured the essence of
real-world open-air markets in VR.
Asuna
401800101_17_a
K-Kidding, I was kidding...
Kirito
401800101_16_a
Hey, who are you calling a bully?!
I haggle fair and square!
Lisbeth
401800101_15_a
Haggling? Bullying? Same
difference I guess.
Kirito
401800101_14_a
Th-That's great...
Asuna
401800101_13_a
Plus, you can haggle the price
down even further here! Hehehe...
Lisbeth
401800101_12_a
It's pretty much the deal
of the year.
Lisbeth
401800101_11_a
Yep! They're selling blacksmith
materials and food and stuff
for super cheap right now.
Lisbeth
401800101_10_a
Are you out bargain-hunting too?
Asuna
401800101_9_a
Asuna
401800101_8_a
Hey, you two! Fancy meeting
you here!
Lisbeth
401800101_7_a
Oh, it's Liz!
Asuna
401800101_6_a
Seriously.
Kirito
401800101_5_a
Whatever's on sale, probably.
I thought things only got this
crazy in real life on Black Friday.
Asuna
401800101_4_a
Guess everyone decided to come out
shopping today. I wonder what
they're buying.
Kirito
401800101_3_a
Kirito
401800101_2_a
bg_21_alne
Wow, look at these crowds...

治ったみたいだな

おう、体力的にはきつかったが、
踏ん張って登ってきてよかったぜ!
クライン

ああ……
この景色がまさにクエスト報酬って
感じだな
キリト

うん……綺麗だね

地平線に朝日が昇り始めましたよ!

今のは、鶏の鳴き声ですよ!

どうなってるんだ?
モンスターは倒したが……
これは間に合ったのか……?

白みかけてるな……
日の出の時間が来たんだな……
エギル

おおっ、見てみろよ!
東の空!

ホントですね
もう戦う意志はない
みたいですけど……
リーファ
401701101_7_a
ん……でもおかしいわね……
あのモンスター、姿が消えない……?
シノン
401701101_6_a
た、倒した!

うん!
アスナ

よし!
みんな、畳みかけるぞ!
キリト

ボスのステータスが
弱体化していきます!

任せて……!
シノン
401701001_13_a
頼んだぜ!
クライン
401701001_12_a
ああ、異論ないぜ!
エギル
401701001_11_a
はい、そうです! 矢尻なので
シノンさんにお任せするのが
一番だろうってことになりました
リーファ
401701001_10_a
あれがこのクエストで
必要になるっていう
ボス特効武器か!?
クライン
401701001_9_a

ええ、七つの虹結晶で作り出した
この《ビフレストの矢》……
絶対に外さないわ!
シノン

シノのん、お願い!
アスナ
401701001_7_a
現れたな……
あれが今回のクエストの
ボスモンスターだ!

キリト
401701001_1_a
はい!
401700901_32_a
うん、ありがとう!
じゃあこの調子でがんばろうね!
アスナ
401700901_31_a
わたしも今……実はちょっとだけ
眠いですけど、皆さんと初日の出が
見られるのはすごく楽しみですよ!
401700901_30_a
ママ……
401700901_29_a
ちゃんとユイちゃんも楽しんで
くれる、良い思い出にしてくれるって
自信があるんだよね……
アスナ
401700901_28_a
そう考えると不思議だな……
嫌がってたはずなのに、
いざ自分が教えるほうになると、
アスナ
401700901_27_a
ふふっ、でも今は娘のユイちゃんと
こうして初日の出が見られることに
すごくワクワクしてる……
アスナ
401700901_26_a
子供の頃は日付が変わって、
両親に起こされてお参りに
行くだけで、すごく嫌だったから……
アスナ
401700901_25_a
親から子に……
401700901_24_a
縁起を担ぐというか……
これも親から子に伝えられる
一つの文化なのかもね
アスナ
401700901_23_a
そうだね
アスナ
401700901_22_a
それでも皆さん、
初日の出が見たいんですね……
401700901_21_a
パパも言っていましたが、初日の出を
見るには、高いところに登る必要が
あって大変なんですよね……
401700901_20_a
ご来光のスポットとかに行くと、
真っ暗なのに沢山の人で
ごった返してると思うよ
アスナ
401700901_19_a
初日の出を見るのを
楽しみにしてるんだろうね
でも……現実でも今頃は、
アスナ
401700901_18_a
そうだね
アスナ
401700901_17_a
ママ、このクエスト
沢山のプレイヤーさん達が
参加してるんですね
401700901_16_a
ユイちゃん、どうしたの?
アスナ
401700901_15_a

401700901_13_a
いいこと言うねぇ～!
クライン
401700901_12_a
ああ、その辺は現実と同じだな
苦労した分だけ、見られるご来光の
ありがたみもベターってことさ
エギル
401700901_11_a
はは、案外このクエきっついよな～
でもよ、それもまた醍醐味って
やつだぜ
クライン
401700901_10_a
だがそのおおかたが
現実で行くよりも、仮想世界の方が
手軽だって思ってたみたいだが……
エギル
401700901_9_a
参加者、結構多いみたいだな
エギル
401700901_8_a
あいつらも初日の出を
拝みに来たってよ
クライン
401700901_7_a
そういやさっき知り合いのプレイヤー
にあったぜ
クライン
401700901_6_a
はは、そうだな
エギル

やっぱダイブしてると
気が紛れるっつーか
楽になってくるから不思議だよな

みんな遅れないように
付いてきてくれ!
世界樹の頂上を目指すぞ!
キリト
401700801_25_a
よし、それじゃあ間もなく
年が明ける世界樹の幹が
伸び始めるはずだ
キリト
401700801_24_a
そうだったな、ユイ!
あんがとよ!
クライン
401700801_23_a
今日は飛行は不可能なクエストです
不幸中の幸いではありますね
401700801_22_a
そうか、わかった
キリト
401700801_21_a
やらせてくれ!
クライン
401700801_20_a
い、いや今日までキリの字たちに
準備を押し付けちまってたからな
今日こそはオレも役に立つぜ……!
クライン
401700801_19_a
……止めとくか、クライン?
キリト
401700801_18_a
そ、想像させんなよ……
クライン
401700801_17_a
クエスト中にリバースすんなよ
オレ達に被害はねーけど、ログアウト
したら悲惨なことになってるぞ
エギル
401700801_16_a
ちょっとクライン
ホントに大丈夫……?
シノン
401700801_15_a
す、すまねぇ……でもプレイしてれば
気も紛れるはずだ……から……
うえっ……
クライン
401700801_14_a
もしかして二日酔いってやつ?
アスナ
401700801_13_a
ち、ちげぇよ……
毎晩飲み会続きで……おえっ……
クライン
401700801_12_a
ん、どうした、クライン
元気ないみたいだな……
深夜だから眠いのか?
キリト

クラインさん、エギルさん、
そしてわたしだね

ふふっ、そうだね!
リーファ
401700701_20_a
ああ、準備に参加できない分、
本番でがんばってもらおうぜ
あいつには
キリト
401700701_19_a
ただクラインさんも、
元旦にはなんとか参加するって
言ってましたよね、パパ
401700701_18_a
うわぁ……
大人って大変だねぇ……
リーファ
401700701_17_a
さすがのあいつも
グロッキー気味みたいだ
キリト
401700701_16_a
年末の締め業務に忙殺されてる上に、
忘年会が毎日のようにあるらしい
キリト
401700701_15_a
そう言えばクラインさん、
最近見ないけどどうしたの?
リーファ
401700701_14_a
この火山地帯なんてサラマンダーの
クラインがいれば、もっと楽に
攻略できたんだろうし……
キリト
401700701_13_a
この限定クエの準備に
参加できるメンバーが四人だけだと、
なにかと大変だな
キリト
401700701_12_a
そうだな
キリト
401700701_11_a
今日は遅いし、
また明日にしとこっか
リーファ
401700701_10_a
インプ領か……ここはサラマンダー領
だから遠くはないけど、
近くもないって感じだね
リーファ
401700701_9_a
紫の虹結晶は、
インプ領の洞窟にあります
401700701_8_a
うーん、そうだな
次の結晶はどこにあるんだっけ?
キリト
401700701_7_a
そうですね
ではパパ、リーファさん、
次の結晶探しに行きますか?
401700701_6_a
あと残り3つ……三色分だね
リーファ
401700701_5_a
ああ、これでアスナ達が
取ったのと合わせて、
全部で四つになるはずだ

シノのん、
気にかけてくれてありがとね
アスナ
401700601_37_a
良かったわね、アスナ
シノン
401700601_36_a
なるほど
だからユイはあんなに
元気そうだったのね
シノン
401700601_35_a
「だからもう少し気を楽にして、
日々を楽しく生きていくことを
考えていきます!」ってね
アスナ
401700601_34_a
この世界の基幹システムの
カーディナルでさえ
わからないことです」
アスナ
401700601_33_a
「わたしは少し考えすぎて
しまったのかもしれません
先のことなんて誰も……
アスナ
401700601_32_a
うん、笑ってた
それでその後にね……
アスナ
401700601_31_a
それであの子はなんて?
シノン
401700601_30_a
ふふっ、冗談冗談……
アスナ
401700601_29_a
し、してないわよ!
シノン
401700601_28_a
シ、シノのん……
盗聴してたの?
アスナ
401700601_27_a
ユイちゃんはそれに比べて、
すごくいい子だよ」とか
言ったんでしょ?
シノン
401700601_26_a
「自分なんて母親と喧嘩して
家を出たいとさえ思ったんだから、
シノン
401700601_25_a
ふふっ、アスナらしいわね
シノン
401700601_24_a
あはは……そのとおり～
アスナ
401700601_23_a
私、なんとなくわかったわ
アスナが母親と
喧嘩したやつでしょう?
シノン
401700601_22_a
シノン
401700601_21_a
あの話……?
シノン
401700601_20_a
実はあの話をしちゃって……
アスナ
401700601_19_a
そんな大したことはしてないんだ……
あの夜ユイちゃんと添い寝をして、
色々なことを話したんだけど……
アスナ
401700601_18_a
う、ううん
そんなことないよ
アスナ
401700601_17_a
え、ええ
聞かれたくなかったんだとしたら、
ごめんなさい……
シノン
401700601_16_a
えっ……あっ
シノのんはユイちゃんのこと、
キリトくんから聞いてたんだっけ?
アスナ
401700601_15_a
ボスについて説明するとき、
ユイが妙に元気だったけど……
あれってなにがあったの?
シノン
401700601_14_a
ん、改まってどうしたの?
アスナ
401700601_13_a
ところで……アスナ、聞いてもいい?
シノン
401700601_12_a
うん!
アスナ
401700601_11_a
ええ、残りもがんばりましょう
シノン
401700601_10_a
七つの虹水晶を集めることで、
ビフレスト・グリンカムビを倒す
ための特攻武器が作れるんだよね
アスナ
401700601_9_a
アスナ
401700601_8_a
今日中に4つは
手に入れられそうかしら
そうなると七色の残りは……三色ね
シノン
401700601_7_a
いま赤の虹水晶の入手に
行ってくれてるから……
アスナ
401700601_6_a
キリトくんとリーファちゃんが
アスナ
401700601_5_a
これでようやく青の虹水晶を
ゲットね
シノン
401700601_4_a
うん、それそれ

シノン
401700601_1_a
わかった
頼むぜ、ユイ
キリト
401700501_24_a
今からそれを説明するので
よく聞いてくださいね
401700501_23_a
この虹色の鳥を倒すには、
様々な準備をする必要が
あるようです
401700501_22_a
ああ、そうだな
キリト
401700501_21_a
はい! わたしはパパとママの
娘であると同時に、ナビゲートする
ピクシーですからね!
401700501_20_a
ユイが調べたのか?
キリト
401700501_19_a
グリンカムビは
神話に登場する一羽の鳥
一説には鶏とも言われています
401700501_18_a
ビフレストは空にかかる虹
401700501_17_a
どちらも北欧神話の用語ですね
リーファ
401700501_16_a
ビフレスト……
グリンカムビ……
シノン
401700501_15_a
はい、名前は
《ビフレスト・グリンカムビ》
401700501_14_a
ボスモンスター……
そんなのがいるんだね
リーファ
401700501_13_a
追加情報の内容は、世界樹の伸びた
先に登場するボスモンスターに
関するものです
401700501_12_a
ふふっ確かに、
その方がいいかもしれないわね
シノン
401700501_11_a
そうかもな……母と娘で語り合って
なにかを分かり合えたなら……
父親の出る幕はなさそうだな
キリト
401700501_10_a
アスナさんも満面の笑顔……
きっと二人でなにかあったんですね
リーファ
401700501_9_a
シノのん、キリトくん
ユイちゃんの話、ちゃんと聞いてね!
アスナ
401700501_8_a
お、俺にもよくわからん……
今朝からずっとあんな感じで……
キリト
401700501_7_a
ね、ねえキリト
ユイどうしたの?
いつになく元気だけど……
シノン

他でもありません!
401700501_1_a
ああ、二人ともありがとう
キリト
401700401_18_a
うん!
あたしもそう思う!
リーファ
401700401_17_a
ええ、それでいいと思うわ
それがあの子にも
きっと伝わるはずよ
シノン
401700401_16_a
それが可能なところまで、
実践し続けることしか
ないんだと思う
キリト
401700401_15_a
俺とアスナにできることは、
ユイにいつまでも一緒にいるって
言い続けることと……
キリト
401700401_14_a
まあそうだよね
現実世界では必ず起こりうる
人生の岐路ってやつだから……
リーファ
401700401_13_a
アスナが付き添って一緒に寝たよ
結局問題は解決できなかった……
というかそもそも無理なんだと思う
キリト
401700401_12_a
で、それからどうしたの?
リーファ
401700401_11_a
そうなんだろうな……
キリト
401700401_10_a
まあね……でもユイもそういう
現実の話を聞いて、いつか来る
別れを感じ取ったわけでしょう?
シノン
401700401_9_a
そういうシノンは、
もうとっくに親離れしてる
んだよな
キリト
401700401_8_a
別に仲が悪くなったわけ
じゃなくても、20年かそこらで
必ず距離は遠のくものだし
シノン
401700401_7_a
現実の親子って
確かにそういうものよ
シノン
401700401_6_a
まったく、
ユイの人間社会を勉強しようとする
真摯な姿勢には頭が下がるわね
シノン
401700401_5_a

401700401_4_a
シノン
401700401_3_a
キリト
401700401_2_a
bg_08_forest
なるほど……
そんなことがあったんだ
リーファ
401700401_1_a
ユイちゃん……
アスナ
401700301_38_a
そう考えたら、
なんだか少し胸が締め付けられる
ようで……
401700301_37_a
はい……来年の今頃も……
わたしはお二人と
一緒にいられるのでしょうか……
401700301_36_a
ああ……でもユイは現実の
そういう景色を知ってるからこそ、
悲しくなっちゃったんだよな
キリト
401700301_35_a
わ、わたしは嫌がりませんよ!
でも……
401700301_34_a
だんだん親子の距離は
遠くなっていくんだろうな
キリト
401700301_33_a
きっと年中行事とかも、
子供が次第に家族でいることを
煙たがったりして、
キリト
401700301_32_a
親は子離れし、子は親離れする
キリト
401700301_31_a
う、うん
アスナ
401700301_30_a
でも今年はそうならない予定だろ?
仮想世界で過ごすんだから
キリト
401700301_29_a
えと……ほとんど毎年京都に行って、
家族や親戚と過ごしてるけど
アスナ
401700301_28_a
たとえばさ、
アスナってこれまでお正月は
どうやって過ごしてきた?
キリト
401700301_27_a
どんな親子でも……?
アスナ
401700301_26_a
それはきっともっと単純で……
どんな親子にでも
起こりうることなんだ
キリト
401700301_25_a
ユイは多分……世界の違いとかを
論じてるわけじゃないんだと思う
キリト
401700301_24_a
えっ?
キ、キリトくん……
ひとりで納得しないでよ!
アスナ
401700301_23_a
なるほど……
キリト
401700301_22_a
ど、どういう意味?
アスナ
401700301_21_a
いえ、それは無理だと思います
なぜなら……親子である以上は、
別れは付き物だからです
401700301_20_a
そうだよ
なにも不安に思うことなんて……
アスナ
401700301_19_a
ああ、そのとおりだ
俺たちはいつでも……
いつまでもユイの親のつもりだぞ
キリト
401700301_18_a
それはお二人が
わたしの親でいてくれるからです
401700301_17_a
世界が違っていても、お二人は
いつも一緒にいてくれます
401700301_16_a
なら……なにを悩んでるの?
アスナ
401700301_15_a
だから最終的にはどちらであっても、
わたしは構わない……すぐそれを
思い出して納得はできたんです
401700301_14_a
で、でも現実世界でも
プローブを使えば皆さんと
一緒に過ごすことができます
401700301_13_a
………………
キリト
401700301_12_a
わたしは無意識に
仮想世界で過ごしてほしいと
思ってしまいました……
401700301_11_a
はい……実は最初……
パパが新年をどこで過ごそうか
考えていると聞いたとき、
401700301_10_a
混乱……?
アスナ
401700301_9_a
い、いえそんなことはありません!
ただ……すみません少し考えが
まとまらず混乱しています
401700301_8_a
……ん?
ユイ、もしかしてイヤなのか?
キリト
401700301_7_a
は、はい……
401700301_6_a
ゆっくり過ごせるのは
きっと登山の後だけどね
あはは……

だから一緒に過ごそうな

401700301_3_a
アスナ

bg_11_home_lounge
ユイ、そういうわけだ
俺たちはALOで
新年を迎えることにした
キリト
401700301_1_a
うん、そうだね
アスナ
401700201_27_a
そういうことだ
ユイも呼んで知らせてやろう
きっと喜ぶはずだ
キリト
401700201_26_a
ああ～、なるほど
リーファ
401700201_25_a
初日の出を現実世界と
こっちのどちらで見ようかってね
アスナ
401700201_24_a
ふふっ、キリトくんはね
ここ数日、ずっと悩んでたんだよ
アスナ
401700201_23_a
えっ?
お兄ちゃん、決めたってなにを?
リーファ
401700201_22_a
なかなか面白そうだな……
よし、決めた!
キリト
401700201_21_a
日付変更から日の出まで……
ざっと5、6時間ってところかしら
シノン
401700201_20_a
なるほど……
その時間帯のみ
飛行禁止になるわけね
シノン
401700201_19_a
大晦日から元旦の日の出までの間、
アルン近辺の夜空は漆黒の闇に包まれ
飛行できなくなるそうです
リーファ
401700201_18_a
でも飛んでいけばいいんじゃ……
以前と違って
飛空制限もないわけだし……
アスナ
401700201_17_a
ご来光までに頂上に辿りついて
初日の出を拝むのが
今回のクエストなんだよ
リーファ
401700201_16_a
そーだよ
そこを昇りながら
天辺を目指していく……
リーファ
401700201_15_a
更に世界樹が高くなるのか?
キリト
401700201_14_a
なんと日付が1月1日になって
初日の出が登るまでの間、世界樹の
幹が一時的に伸びるそうなんです
リーファ
401700201_13_a
ノンノン!
アスナさんもシノンさんも
早とちりしちゃダメです!
リーファ
401700201_12_a
それなら普通にイグシティに行って
見ればいいだけじゃないの?
シノン
401700201_11_a
世界樹の上で
初日の出を見るってこと?
アスナ
401700201_10_a
イグドラシルってことは……
世界樹だよね?
アスナ
401700201_9_a
その名も
《サンライズ・オブ・
ジ・イグドラシル》!
リーファ
401700201_8_a
ALOも例に漏れず、です!
最初に実装されるのは、
なんと元旦の初日の出チャレンジ!
リーファ
401700201_7_a
年末・新年っていわゆる連休だから、
VRMMOでも
なにかとイベントが多いのよね
シノン
401700201_6_a
新年の新しいクエストが
色々発表されたんだよ!
リーファ
401700201_5_a
ん、どうしたスグ?
キリト
401700201_4_a
シノン
401700201_3_a
キリト
401700201_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
じゃーん!
リーファ
401700201_1_a
………………
キリト
401700101_29_a
ちょっとお外に出て、
早速お日様の光を浴びてきますね!
401700101_28_a
……?
アスナ
401700101_27_a
いえ、なんでもありません
401700101_26_a
ん、どうしたんだユイ?
キリト
401700101_25_a
は、はい……
401700101_24_a
ユイちゃん、心配しないでね
たとえ現実で見に行ったとしても、
プローブで連れてってあげるからね
アスナ
401700101_23_a
ただやっぱり初日の出くらいは
現実の方が風情があるというか……
キリト
401700101_22_a
では仮想世界にしますか?
401700101_21_a
はは、スミマセン……
キリト
401700101_20_a
もーっ、キリトくん
オジサン臭いよ～
アスナ
401700101_19_a
大抵山の上とかだから、
行くまで疲れるし、
すげー寒いし……
キリト
401700101_18_a
前日テレビとか見てどうせ
夜更かししてるから眠いだろうし……
それに日の出が見られる場所って、
キリト
401700101_17_a
現実でやろうとすると、
すんごくキツイんだよなぁ
キリト
401700101_16_a
なるほど、そうだったんですね
401700101_15_a
ああ、それを現実世界で見に行くか、
それともALOで
見るべきかって考えてたのさ
キリト
401700101_14_a
日本人は皆さん朝早く起きて、
山頂などに登り、
それを拝むとは聞いていますが……
401700101_13_a
初日の出……確か元旦の朝の
日の出のことですよね?
401700101_12_a
冬の天気と……関係なくも
ないんだが、初日の出をどっちで
見ようかって考えてたんだよ
キリト
401700101_11_a
あっ、それでパパは
なにをうなっているんですか?
401700101_10_a
うーん……
キリト
401700101_9_a
そうなんですね!
冬でお天気がいいと
なんだか嬉しいですね
401700101_8_a
そうだね
今日外はポカポカで
お日様も眩しいくらいなんだよ
アスナ
401700101_7_a
ママ、おはようございます
今日はとってもお天気がいいですね
401700101_6_a
ユイちゃん、おはよう
アスナ
401700101_5_a
パパ、どうしたんですか?
401700101_4_a
アスナ
401700101_3_a
401700101_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
うーん、どうするかな……?
キリト
401700101_1_a
Hehe, that's what I like to hear.
Rechka
401601301_20_a
O-Okay!
Asuna
401601301_19_a
...!
Asuna
401601301_18_a
And tell him how you feel already!
Rechka
401601301_17_a
Alright, I'll see you later then.
Take care, Asuna.
Rechka
401601301_16_a
Hehe, thank you...
Well, I should be going...
Asuna
401601301_15_a
You're already a full-blown chef
in your own right, Asuna.
Rechka
401601301_14_a
Ha ha, who said anything about
that?
Rechka
401601301_13_a
Okay! I guess that makes me
your sous-chef!
Asuna
401601301_12_a
I'll help you however I can.
Rechka
401601301_11_a
Hehe, I will. If you ever need any
culinary advice, you know where
to find me.
Rechka
401601301_10_a
Of course! I gathered plenty of
them. Just use them in something
delicious.
Asuna
401601301_9_a
But you worked so hard to get
these sag leaves... Are you sure
I can have them?
Rechka
401601301_8_a
So this is my way of
saying thank you.
Asuna
401601301_7_a
Asuna...
Rechka
401601301_6_a
No, I meant... You taught me how
to truly appreciate cooking
in this world...
Asuna
401601301_5_a
Me? I didn't do anything.
Rechka
401601301_4_a
It's all thanks to you!
Asuna
401601301_3_a
Asuna
401601301_2_a
bg_05_restaurant
I'm glad you got those sag leaves
safe and sound!
Rechka
401601301_1_a
Ehehe...
Asuna
401601201_22_a
Uh-huh... 
sigh
Being twitterpated sure makes
things complicated, doesn't it?
Lisbeth
401601201_21_a
Th-That's all. I want it to be
a...a surprise. That's it.
Asuna
401601201_20_a
Um... Because I...want to use that
ingredient to make something
for him to eat...
Asuna
401601201_19_a
Sooo, why didn't you tell him?
It's just a cooking ingredient
we're after, nothing super secret.
Lisbeth
401601201_18_a
...
Lisbeth
401601201_17_a
Later, Kirito.
Lisbeth
401601201_16_a
We will. Bye!
Asuna
401601201_15_a
Oh, okay. Well, I'll see you two
around. Stay safe.
Kirito
401601201_14_a
Uh... No, that's okay. We'll be
fine. It's not that big of a
deal. You go on ahead.
Asuna
401601201_13_a
You are? If there's still
something you need to do,
I'll come with you.
Kirito
401601201_12_a
Oh, um... We're going to stay here
a little longer.
Asuna
401601201_11_a
Alright, ready to head back?
Kirito
401601201_10_a
It's pretty handy...
Lisbeth
401601201_9_a
Right? Apparently everyone who's
beaten the Dullahan has used that
same strategy.
Kirito
401601201_8_a
Yeah... Thanks for your help,
Kirito. Using those pebbles
definitely made a big difference.
Asuna
401601201_7_a
Phew... I can't believe we won...
Lisbeth
401601201_6_a
Alright, we did it!
Kirito
401601201_5_a
Asuna
401601201_4_a
Lisbeth
401601201_3_a
Kirito
401601201_2_a
bg_04_forest_night
GRAAAAOOHHHH!!
Dullahan
401601201_1_a
Got it!
Asuna
401601101_27_a
Now's our chance! We have to
strike quickly, before it can
re-orient itself!
Kirito
401601101_26_a
It's getting confused!
Lisbeth
401601101_25_a
Graaauuuh?!
Gruaaaaaaahh...?!
Dullahan
401601101_24_a
Take THIS!
Lisbeth
401601101_23_a
Okay!
Asuna
401601101_22_a
Alright, we have to throw all the
pebbles at the same time!
Kirito
401601101_21_a
Graaaaaooohh...
Dullahan
401601101_20_a
Uhm...?
Okay then...
Kirito
401601101_19_a
N-No one! And it's rude to
eavesdrop, you know!
Asuna
401601101_18_a
Who's Rechka?
Kirito
401601101_17_a
I guess...
Lisbeth
401601101_16_a
That means there must be a way
to defeat the Dullahan.
Asuna
401601101_15_a
Let's try it his way, Liz. Rechka
did say someone came here and got
the ingredient for her.
Asuna
401601101_14_a
Apparently some players have been
able to take it down using this
strategy.
Kirito
401601101_13_a
Yeah. I know it's kind of a
half-baked plan, but we
might as well try.
Kirito
401601101_12_a
So throwing these pebbles at it
will create a kind of smokescreen
we can use to shield our attacks.
Lisbeth
401601101_11_a
Hahaha, I should've known
all this info came from her.
Asuna
401601101_10_a
That's what Argo said, anyway.
Kirito
401601101_9_a
But it can sense minute vibrations
in the air around its body, which
is how it knows what to do.
Kirito
401601101_8_a
Taste...?
Asuna
401601101_7_a
Trust me. No head means no sense
of sight or sound, obviously, let
alone being able to taste or talk.
Kirito
401601101_6_a
Is this really gonna work?
Lisbeth
401601101_5_a
A-Alright...
Asuna
401601101_4_a
Lisbeth
401601101_3_a
Asuna
401601101_2_a
bg_04_forest_night
First, help me gather up as many
of the pebbles around here as
you possibly can.
Kirito
401601101_1_a
Which is...?
Asuna
401601001_27_a
There's a secret to its trick.
Kirito
401601001_26_a
It even felt like it was tracking
our movements...
Asuna
401601001_25_a
B-But its attacks were aimed
at us almost perfectly!
Asuna
401601001_24_a
What?!
Lisbeth
401601001_23_a
Well, it really IS sightless. It's
even part of its combat data and
everything.
Kirito
401601001_22_a
Anyway, what did you mean when you
said I was mistaken about the
Dullahan?
Asuna
401601001_21_a
I'm not a weirdo. I just got used
to playing solo!
Kirito
401601001_20_a
What kind of weirdo comes to a
place like this by himself?
Lisbeth
401601001_19_a
Yep.
Kirito
401601001_18_a
Uh... Yeah... Kirito, did you come
here by yourself?
Asuna
401601001_17_a
You guys...aren't?
Kirito
401601001_16_a
I'm after that Dullahan. Well,
specifically the mother load of
EXP you get for defeating it.
Kirito
401601001_15_a
Wh-What are you doing here?!
Lisbeth
401601001_14_a
K-Kirito?!
Asuna
401601001_13_a
Hey Asuna, hey Liz.
Heck of a place to run into
each other, huh?
Kirito
401601001_12_a
Excuse me?
Asuna
401601001_11_a
Actually, you're mistaken.
???
401601001_10_a
Yeah, I guess you're right...
Lisbeth
401601001_9_a
Just because it was designed to be
headless for aesthetics doesn't
mean it's necessarily sightless.
Asuna
401601001_8_a
What I wanna know is how it can be
so deadly accurate when it can't
even see!
Lisbeth
401601001_7_a
You can say that again.
Lisbeth
401601001_6_a
Luckily it doesn't chase after
players when they retreat...
Asuna
401601001_5_a
That Dullahan was seriously tough.
Asuna
401601001_4_a
It's not your fault, Liz.
Asuna
401601001_3_a
Asuna
401601001_2_a
bg_04_forest_night
I-I'm so sorry, Asuna...
Lisbeth
401601001_1_a
Ha ha, don't worry. I know I can
count on you, Liz!
Asuna
401600901_17_a
You got it. I'll do my best not to
get in the way, Vice Commander!
Lisbeth
401600901_16_a
though I'm more concerned about
discerning its behavior pattern
than beating it. Just be careful!
Asuna
401600901_15_a
I don't think we'll be able to
gather the materials we need if
we don't do something about it,
Asuna
401600901_14_a
Hmmm... Alright. We'll give it a
shot, but be prepared to retreat
at a moment's notice.
Asuna
401600901_13_a
Looks like it. Now what?
Do we try fighting it?
Lisbeth
401600901_12_a
Ehehe, or not. Looks like it's
dead-set on blocking our
forward progress.
Asuna
401600901_11_a
Grraaaauuhhh...
Dullahan
401600901_10_a
Maybe it'll be nice and just
let us pass on our merry way...
Asuna
401600901_9_a
Ugh... Sounds like a pain. We just
can't catch a break, can we?
Lisbeth
401600901_8_a
Exactly.
Asuna
401600901_7_a
So like the headless horseman in
The Legend of Sleepy Hollow?
Lisbeth
401600901_6_a
A headless, armored monster...
It must be a Dullahan.
Asuna
401600901_5_a
Wh-What the heck is that?!
Lisbeth
401600901_4_a
Asuna
401600901_3_a
Lisbeth
401600901_2_a
bg_04_forest_night
Grraaaaoooooohhh...
Dullahan
401600901_1_a
Okay!
Asuna
401600801_18_a
Hehe, I told you not to worry
about it. C'mon, let's get going.
Lisbeth
401600801_17_a
Yeah... You're right. Thanks, Liz.
Asuna
401600801_16_a
and you your ingredients.
We didn't come here to drink tea
and chat all day!
Lisbeth
401600801_15_a
Besides, the both of us are here
to get what we want out of
this forest. Me my lumber,
Lisbeth
401600801_14_a
I suppose...
Asuna
401600801_13_a
She could tell you're a top-notch
chef just like her. That's why
she let you in on her secrets.
Lisbeth
401600801_12_a
That's okay. I understand.
Lisbeth
401600801_11_a
Um... Uh... Sorry, but it was kind
of a private conversation. I'm not
supposed to tell anyone else...
Asuna
401600801_10_a
Oh...? Did you two talk about
stuff besides kickass cooking
techniques?
Lisbeth
401600801_9_a
Yeah. Rechka gave me a lot
to think about too...
Asuna
401600801_8_a
I'm getting more pumped about
cooking in VR now just
thinking about it!
Lisbeth
401600801_7_a
Speaking of which, that chef-lady
sounds pretty cool from what you
told me.
Lisbeth
401600801_6_a
Y-Yeah...
Asuna
401600801_5_a
It's way too risky by yourself, but
there's no way you could use your
guild to help gather ingredients.
Lisbeth
401600801_4_a
No worries, I'm happy to help.
Especially if you're poking
around on Floor 70.
Lisbeth
401600801_3_a
Lisbeth
401600801_2_a
bg_04_forest_night
Sorry to drag you along, Liz.
Asuna
401600801_1_a
Rechka...
Asuna
401600701_40_a
I think I could open up to you
because you and I feel the exact
same way about cooking.
Rechka
401600701_39_a
sigh
...
Asuna
401600701_38_a
Ha ha, you don't have to hide it.
I know straight away about that
kind of thing. It comes with age.
Rechka
401600701_37_a
...
Asuna
401600701_36_a
They... I...!
Asuna
401600701_35_a
Wh-What?!
Asuna
401600701_34_a
The person who said that...
is very dear to you, right?
Rechka
401600701_33_a
Earlier you said a friend got you
thinking that it's important to
put effort into cooking...
Rechka
401600701_32_a
What?
Why would you confide in me...?
Asuna
401600701_31_a
Hehe, but you're really the only
one I've ever told...
Rechka
401600701_30_a
Not at all. I didn't tell you
anything I didn't want to.
Rechka
401600701_29_a
I didn't mean to pry into
something so private...
Asuna
401600701_28_a
I-I'm sorry...
Asuna
401600701_27_a
it's like...I can still feel him
near me...
Rechka
401600701_26_a
Now that I'm gathering those
ingredients and using them to
cook for other players,
Rechka
401600701_25_a
everything he left behind in this
world. That's why I dove in.
Rechka
401600701_24_a
Yes. And I... I wanted to see
everything that he made,
Rechka
401600701_23_a
Making all their graphics?
Asuna
401600701_22_a
Apparently, the part that my
husband was in charge of was
all the ingredients.
Rechka
401600701_21_a
...
Asuna
401600701_20_a
He looked exhausted,
but as he ate, he'd smile.
I loved seeing that...
Rechka
401600701_19_a
Are of him coming home late,
eating the food I'd made him,
and telling me it was delicious.
Rechka
401600701_18_a
But the only memories
I have left of him...
Rechka
401600701_17_a
I do. Sometimes I wonder
what the hell I'm doing.
Rechka
401600701_16_a
I...
Asuna
401600701_15_a
Hehe, do you think me odd?
Diving into the very game that
stole my husband from me?
Rechka
401600701_14_a
Rechka...
Asuna
401600701_13_a
By the time I noticed the
strain on him, it had already
taken its toll.
Rechka
401600701_12_a
There really were so few of them
working on this. He must've taken
on too much, worked too hard...
Rechka
401600701_11_a
No, not in this death game. He
died several months before the
closed beta even started.
Rechka
401600701_10_a
You don't mean...?
Asuna
401600701_9_a
But a few years after that, he...
He went where I couldn't follow.
Rechka
401600701_8_a
...
Asuna
401600701_7_a
He thought their brand would
take off if they worked on
such an innovative title...
Rechka
401600701_6_a
He was thrilled when they got
the request to work on something
as major as SAO.
Rechka
401600701_5_a
No, he worked for a tiny graphics
company they subcontracted. There
were only a few people on staff.
Rechka
401600701_4_a
You mean...he works for Argus?
Asuna
401600701_3_a
Asuna
401600701_2_a
bg_05_restaurant
My husband...helped to develop
this game...
Rechka
401600701_1_a
...
Rechka
401600601_33_a
Why did you decide to become
a cook in this world?
Asuna
401600601_32_a
Rechka...
Asuna
401600601_31_a
there are just as many ingredients
as in real life... And I want to
get my hands on them all.
Rechka
401600601_30_a
There are limits to what items
I can gather on my own, after all.
Here in VR,
Rechka
401600601_29_a
Yeah. I've never been there myself.
I just use the money I earn from
cooking to buy what I need.
Rechka
401600601_28_a
That place is crawling with
tough mobs, isn't it?
Asuna
401600601_27_a
Well, it was originally used for
recovery drinks. You can find it
in the forest on Floor 70.
Rechka
401600601_26_a
Sag leaves? I've never heard
of that ingredient before.
Asuna
401600601_25_a
You really do have a discerning
sense of taste! You were so close.
You just needed to add sag leaves.
Rechka
401600601_24_a
but the sweetness is always wrong,
like there's something missing...
Asuna
401600601_23_a
Y-Yeah... I've tried using abilba
seed and ulafish bone before,
Asuna
401600601_22_a
The look on your face tells me
you've tried and failed
to nail it down just right.
Rechka
401600601_21_a
But...how did you...?
Asuna
401600601_20_a
Correct you are!
Rechka
401600601_19_a
Huh?
Is this flavored with soy sauce?!
Asuna
401600601_18_a
R-Right!
munch
munch
...
Asuna
401600601_17_a
I didn't say identify it,
I said eat it!
Rechka
401600601_16_a
This is...broiled fish, right?
Asuna
401600601_15_a
I see...
Here, try this.
Rechka
401600601_14_a
Ha ha, well, I started thinking
that way because of a friend
of mine...
Asuna
401600601_13_a
Hehe, I couldn't have said it
better myself.
Rechka
401600601_12_a
then I truly believe this world's
food can be just as good-if not
better-than the real world.
Asuna
401600601_11_a
Yeah. There are certainly fewer
steps you have to take, but if
you put in the time and effort,
Asuna
401600601_10_a
At least, that's what an amateur
might think. I think that's far
too simplistic.
Rechka
401600601_9_a
Cooking in VR just means pressing
a button to level up and then mixing
random things together...
Rechka
401600601_8_a
Yes, exactly.
Good old trial and error.
Rechka
401600601_7_a
the more I discovered and the
better I got. Like the easiest
way to add fragrance to something.
Asuna
401600601_6_a
Ahaha... Well, I made a lot of
mistakes starting out, but the
more I experimented,
Asuna
401600601_5_a
Otherwise there's little chance of
anything happening. I thought I
was the only one who did that.
Rechka
401600601_4_a
Ooh... I know that method.
Rechka
401600601_3_a
Rechka
401600601_2_a
bg_05_restaurant
And now you mix in just a bit of
sealtree extract...
Asuna
401600601_1_a
I need a few more ingredients,
though. Mind coming with me
to get them?
Rechka
401600501_29_a
Something tasty, of course!
Rechka
401600501_28_a
Wh-What should we make?
Asuna
401600501_27_a
Alright then, why don't you come
over? We can make something
together.
Rechka
401600501_26_a
Oh, um, yes. My level is fairly
high.
Asuna
401600501_25_a
I take it you cook too?
Rechka
401600501_24_a
N-Not at all... I shouldn't have
just dropped in on you like this.
Asuna
401600501_23_a
I never thought anyone would want
something different of me.
Rechka
401600501_22_a
Sorry, but most people who hear
about me only come to get something
to buff their stats.
Rechka
401600501_21_a
Pfft...! Bhahaha! That's a
side-splitter! I think we're
gonna get along.
Rechka
401600501_20_a
...
Rechka
401600501_19_a
I wanted to see what kind of
person you were...
Asuna
401600501_18_a
The truth is... I heard rumors
that you've mastered cooking
in this world, and...
Asuna
401600501_17_a
Oh? Then what is it?
Rechka
401600501_16_a
It's not that...
Asuna
401600501_15_a
I've mastered every stat-buffing
recipe there is, so just name it.
Rechka
401600501_14_a
Something to increase your
strength? Your agility?
Rechka
401600501_13_a
Oh, um... Well...
Asuna
401600501_12_a
just to see me, there must be
something you're hoping I'll
cook for you.
Rechka
401600501_11_a
So what do you want me to make for
you? If you've come all the way
down to this little bit of nowhere
Rechka
401600501_10_a
Huh...?
Asuna
401600501_9_a
Well, it doesn't really matter.
Rechka
401600501_8_a
A-Actually, I'm a member of the
Kni-
Asuna
401600501_7_a
Asuna? Asuna...
I've heard that name before...
Rechka
401600501_6_a
M-My name is Asuna.
I've come here to see you...
Asuna
401600501_5_a
You don't look like you
live in this village.
Rechka
401600501_4_a
Yes? I am Rechka, but who are you?
???
401600501_3_a
???
401600501_2_a
bg_05_restaurant
Um, excuse me...
Rechka?
Asuna
401600501_1_a
Nehehehe!
Argo
401600401_24_a
Hngh-!
Argoooooo!
Asuna
401600401_23_a
Kii-boy? Who said anythin' about
him? Not me, that's fer sure!
Argo
401600401_22_a
Kirito and I are JUST friends!
Asuna
401600401_21_a
My...?! G-Give me a break, Argo!
Asuna
401600401_20_a
Nehehe, what about askin' yer
lover boy to tag along with ya?
Argo
401600401_19_a
It's a lower floor, anyway.
I'll be all right on my own.
Asuna
401600401_18_a
Yes. I can't exactly
mobilize the Knights for
such a personal matter.
Asuna
401600401_17_a
Ya plannin' on visitin' her by
yerself, Asu?
Argo
401600401_16_a
Every last one...?
Asuna
401600401_15_a
that she'd gotten her hands
on every ingredient
in SAO.
Argo
401600401_14_a
Yup. Apparently people started
callin' her a "master chef" once
they found out
Argo
401600401_13_a
She used all her money on
cookware and ingredients?
Asuna
401600401_12_a
but who spent all her hard-earned
Col on her kitchen, and all her
time on raisin' her cookin' skill.
Argo
401600401_11_a
I kept hearin' about this player
with a decently high level, who
didn't try ta clear the floors,
Argo
401600401_10_a
I see...
Asuna
401600401_9_a
But then it was easy ta narrow
down from there who had an
affinity fer the gourmet.
Argo
401600401_8_a
Eh, the only tough part was
findin' out where she lived, since
it's such a minor neighborhood.
Argo
401600401_7_a
I hope it wasn't too difficult
to find all this out...
Asuna
401600401_6_a
Thank you so much, Argo!
Asuna
401600401_5_a
I'm positive that's her,
the one who's mastered cookin'
in this world.
Argo
401600401_4_a
Yup. She lives on Floor 22, in a
village south of the central
district.
Argo
401600401_3_a
Argo
401600401_2_a
bg_08_calmdead
Rechka... Is that her name?
Asuna
401600401_1_a
Hahaha, I understand.
Asuna
401600301_22_a
I'm runnin' a business here,
after all. Favors don't fill the
coffers!
Argo
401600301_21_a
Nahaha, that goes without sayin'!
Argo
401600301_20_a
Of course! Oh, and I promise I'll
pay you whatever you want!
Asuna
401600301_19_a
Don't thank me just yet.
Wait till I come back with
some actual info.
Argo
401600301_18_a
R-Really? Thank you!
Asuna
401600301_17_a
I'll do what I can.
Argo
401600301_16_a
Welp, it's a tall order, but
I've handled tall orders fer ya
before, Asu.
Argo
401600301_15_a
Hmmm...
Argo
401600301_14_a
about cooking in Sword Art Online,
in virtual reality...
Asuna
401600301_13_a
It makes me think that person must
have discovered something
Asuna
401600301_12_a
It's the phrasing that's making
me curious. Someone who's
"mastered cooking in this world."
Asuna
401600301_11_a
I suppose that's true, but...
Asuna
401600301_10_a
...
Asuna
401600301_9_a
I mean, most'd rather busy
themselves at a stove than risk
their life on the front lines.
Argo
401600301_8_a
Firstly, lotsa players are
raisin' their cookin' skill.
Argo
401600301_7_a
I know...
Asuna
401600301_6_a
It's not much ta go off.
Argo
401600301_5_a
It won't be easy, that's fer sure,
not if that's the only info
ya got fer me.
Argo
401600301_4_a
Yes. Do you think you'll
be able to find them?
Asuna
401600301_3_a
Asuna
401600301_2_a
bg_08_calmdead
So ya want me to look inta this
"master chef" character, Asu?
Argo
401600301_1_a
A player who's mastered cooking
in this world...
Asuna
401600201_20_a
...
Asuna
401600201_19_a
Well then, I'll see you there.
Asuna
401600201_18_a
I-Indeed...
Kuradeel
401600201_17_a
Besides, we have a meeting
to attend.
Asuna
401600201_16_a
That won't be necessary. Even if
I were to meet such a player, we'd
likely have nothing to discuss.
Asuna
401600201_15_a
I would be happy to accompany you
in search of this player...
Kuradeel
401600201_14_a
No. I'm unsure of the details
myself, only that their prowess
surpasses numerical measurement...
Kuradeel
401600201_13_a
Mastered as in they've maxed out
the level of their cooking skill?
Asuna
401600201_12_a
have you heard of the player
rumored to have mastered cooking
in this world?
Kuradeel
401600201_11_a
Y-Yes, of course...
But first, might I ask,
Kuradeel
401600201_10_a
Such as the meeting for clearing
the next floor that we should
be heading to right now.
Asuna
401600201_9_a
I think we have more important
matters on our plate, Kuradeel.
Asuna
401600201_8_a
And perhaps someday, I might
entreat you to more...personal
dining accommodations?
Kuradeel
401600201_7_a
Someday, I'm sure.
Asuna
401600201_6_a
I hope you will grace our palates
with your divine dishes again!
Kuradeel
401600201_5_a
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Asuna
401600201_4_a
The meal you prepared for the
Knights today was superb!
A delight for the senses!
Kuradeel
401600201_3_a
Asuna
401600201_2_a
bg_10_kob_room
Wonderful! You're absolutely
wonderful, ma'am!
Kuradeel
401600201_1_a
C-Cut it out already!
Asuna
401600101_21_a
You can't help it if you're-what's
that word again? Oh yeah:
twitterpated!
Lisbeth
401600101_20_a
It's okay, your secret is safe
with me.
Lisbeth
401600101_19_a
What?! No way! You're reading way
too far into this, Liz!
Asuna
401600101_18_a
There's someone you want to cook
a fancy meal for, isn't there?
Lisbeth
401600101_17_a
What's "it"?! Quit nodding to
yourself like some sage who just
figured out the meaning of life!
Asuna
401600101_16_a
Wait. Oh... That's it.
That's totally it!
Lisbeth
401600101_15_a
Um... Well, I...
Asuna
401600101_14_a
I can't figure out why you'd pour
everything into cooking skills
instead of battle skills.
Lisbeth
401600101_13_a
You're not just any player. You're
the vice commander of the Knights
of the Blood Oath.
Lisbeth
401600101_12_a
I suppose...
Asuna
401600101_11_a
That's an understatement,
considering you're pretty much
at the max level.
Lisbeth
401600101_10_a
Huh?
Well... I, uh, like to cook...
Asuna
401600101_9_a
So what are you trying to improve
your cooking skill for anyway,
Asuna?
Lisbeth
401600101_8_a
Ha ha, coming right up.
Asuna
401600101_7_a
In that case, I'll have thirds!
Lisbeth
401600101_6_a
Oh, you temptress! Are you trying
to fatten me up? Though I guess
we can't get fat here, huh...?
Lisbeth
401600101_5_a
There's plenty more where
that came from, so help yourself
to seconds!
Asuna
401600101_4_a
Really? I'm so glad to hear that!
Asuna
401600101_3_a
Asuna
401600101_2_a
bg_08_asuna_room
This is SO good!
I'm in heaven!
Lisbeth
401600101_1_a
Ha ha, I guess not.
Klein
401501301_33_a
Ha ha, leave off Klein. I can't
imagine I'd make a very merry
Santa right now.
Kirito
401501301_32_a
So go on! Have a jolly Christmas!
Just do me a favor and don't try
to slide down any chimneys.
Klein
401501301_31_a
Great! Heh, you look much happier
than you did a minute ago, know
that?
Klein
401501301_30_a
Nah, I think I'm good. I won't
mope about anymore or let it
drag me down.
Kirito
401501301_29_a
Heh, good. Now if you've gotta
weep, I'm here for you, man.
I won't tell Asuna, promise.
Klein
401501301_28_a
Thanks. I feel like a weight's
been lifted off my chest here,
ha ha...
Kirito
401501301_27_a
Klein...
Yeah, you might just be right...
Kirito
401501301_26_a
A part of you died with them,
and you're here to acknowledge
that, and move on.
Klein
401501301_25_a
You're here to make a break from
your past, aren't you?
Klein
401501301_24_a
They died on this day, that's
true. But you're not just here to
lay flowers on their graves...
Klein
401501301_23_a
...
Kirito
401501301_22_a
Then I'm sure they feel the same
way I do. They don't want to see
you like that ever again.
Klein
401501301_21_a
They...were once, at least...
Kirito
401501301_20_a
And K-dawg...
They were your friends too, right?
Klein
401501301_19_a
...
Kirito
401501301_18_a
You're my friend.
I want you to be happy.
Klein
401501301_17_a
But I'm gonna say this. They got
no right to make you look like
you did back then, got it?!
Klein
401501301_16_a
I don't know what your friends
would say if they were here,
or what they'd think of you...
Klein
401501301_15_a
Klein...
Kirito
401501301_14_a
The way you looked after you beat
Nicholas the Renegade... I never
want to see you like that again.
Klein
401501301_13_a
But listen... There's one thing
I want you to know...
Klein
401501301_12_a
I get it, Kirito. Those scars you
got: you think they're healed, but
they still hurt from time to time.
Klein
401501301_11_a
Sorry, Klein. Ha ha, I guess
I'm not over it after all...
Kirito
401501301_10_a
Kirito...
Klein
401501301_9_a
I should have told Keita the
truth, even if it hurt...
I should have
Kirito
401501301_8_a
I knew Sachi never wanted to
fight, yet I never said anything.
I never let her know how I felt...
Kirito
401501301_7_a
What if I never found that stupid
event mob? Or asked Argo to help
bring it to half health?
Kirito
401501301_6_a
What if I'd convinced Keita not to
make Sachi switch weapons? Or
didn't back the guild house idea?
Kirito
401501301_5_a
But still, I think about it now
and then... I had so many
opportunities to change things...
Kirito
401501301_4_a
Nothing I do now can change the
past. As much as I hate myself for
it, I have to live with that.
Kirito
401501301_3_a
Kirito
401501301_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
I see...
So that's what happened...
Klein
401501301_1_a
Keita...
Kirito
401501201_32_a
W-Well, we got a long day ahead of
us tomorrow! Good night, Kirito!
Keita
401501201_31_a
B-But...it sounded important...
Kirito
401501201_30_a
Ah, nothing! Nevermind!
Forget it, seriously!
Keita
401501201_29_a
Huh? Sorry, I didn't catch that.
What did you say?
Kirito
401501201_28_a
Well, the thing is...
Sachi, she...
Uh, she's interested in you...
Keita
401501201_27_a
I mean, you all are.
You're my guildies.
Kirito
401501201_26_a
Huh? Sachi...? I think she's
a great person. Why?
Kirito
401501201_25_a
O-Oh, and one other thing... It's
about Sachi... What do you think
of her?
Keita
401501201_24_a
Keita...?
Kirito
401501201_23_a
You're always right, after all...
Keita
401501201_22_a
I see... Well, if you say so...
Keita
401501201_21_a
I bet another party just finished
tangling with it when we showed
up, or it was just made that way.
Kirito
401501201_20_a
I'm not THAT good... So whoever
did it, it wasn't me.
Kirito
401501201_19_a
take out half of that thing's HP
on my own? Ha ha, I guess I'd have
to be awesome if it were true!
Kirito
401501201_18_a
I mean, my level's not that much
higher than yours, right? How
could I, going solo...
Kirito
401501201_17_a
Kirito...
Keita
401501201_16_a
N-No.
Not at all.
You're imagining things.
Kirito
401501201_15_a
...
Keita
401501201_14_a
W-Well...
Kirito
401501201_13_a
Did you secretly go on ahead of us
and take out half of that thing's
HP on your own?
Keita
401501201_12_a
Everyone was too worked up to
really think about it... But I got
to wondering...
Keita
401501201_11_a
That was you, wasn't it?
Keita
401501201_10_a
What!
Kirito
401501201_9_a
Remember how that event monster
we fought was at half health when
we found it?
Keita
401501201_8_a
There...is?
What, exactly?
Kirito
401501201_7_a
K-Kirito... There's something
I need to know.
Keita
401501201_6_a
Shouldn't we be, you know...
sleeping?
Kirito
401501201_5_a
Wasn't the plan to meet up in the
Town of Beginnings tomorrow and
talk to the real-estate player?
Kirito
401501201_4_a
Keita, what's wrong? Why did you
call me out here this late at
night?
Kirito
401501201_3_a
Kirito
401501201_2_a
bg_03_bed_light
Kirito...
Keita
401501201_1_a
H-Hey, I said forget it! Never
happened! So, uh...bye!
Kirito
401501101_24_a
Oh, that is just SO mean! I'm not
letting you off the hook! Finish
that thought RIGHT NOW!
Sachi
401501101_23_a
Ha ha... Weeelll... Can we pretend
this conversation never happened?
Kirito
401501101_22_a
H-Hey! What gives?! Don't just cut
off like that?! What were you
going to say?!
Sachi
401501101_21_a
Uh, umm... Nevermind.
It's nothing.
Kirito
401501101_20_a
Hmm? I what?
Sachi
401501101_19_a
Sachi...
Don't tell me you...?
Kirito
401501101_18_a
Ugh, you idiot! That's not what
I'm talking about at all! You just
don't get it!
Sachi
401501101_17_a
Ha ha, well, this isn't real,
right?
Kirito
401501101_16_a
Like we're somewhere we don't
belong, somewhere we were never
meant to be. It...bothers me...
Sachi
401501101_15_a
Well, I am happy, but...recently
I get the weirdest feelings...
Like none of this is real...
Sachi
401501101_14_a
Sachi...aren't you happy? Now
we can finally get that guild
house everyone wanted.
Kirito
401501101_13_a
Ick, look at him... He's acting
like a kid in a candy shop...
Sachi
401501101_12_a
Sasamaru! Everyone! Nice work!
Make sure to heal up before we
leave!
Keita
401501101_11_a
No need to thank me...
Kirito
401501101_10_a
Really, I mean it. Thank you.
Keita
401501101_9_a
It feels like everything's been
going our way since you showed up!
Keita
401501101_8_a
Seriously, Kirito, thanks for
joining our guild!
Keita
401501101_7_a
Y-Yeah, you're right...
W-Woohoo...
Kirito
401501101_6_a
What do you mean, "congrats"?!
You're one of us! This is your
victory too, man!
Keita
401501101_5_a
We certainly do. Congrats, Keita.
Kirito
401501101_4_a
Sachi
401501101_3_a
Kirito
401501101_2_a
bg_03_field_wolf
We did it... We actually did it!
Now we've finally got enough Col
to buy a guild house!
Keita
401501101_1_a
...
Kirito
401501001_14_a
O-Okay... Got it...
Sachi
401501001_13_a
Sasamaru, bring your group in!
Take it slow and steady,
same tactics as always!
Keita
401501001_12_a
Come on, Sachi! Get your head
in the game!
Keita
401501001_11_a
R-Really...?
Sachi
401501001_10_a
Y-Yeah!
We'll take it down for sure!
Kirito
401501001_9_a
Right, Kirito?!
Keita
401501001_8_a
But we lucked out! It's only at
half health for some reason!
We can take it if we stay calm!
Keita
401501001_7_a
D-Don't worry! We got it! I know
it's stronger than anything we've
fought before...
Keita
401501001_6_a
Th-This thing's really strong!
Sachi
401501001_5_a
Kirito
401501001_4_a
Keita
401501001_3_a
Sachi
401501001_2_a
bg_03_field_wolf
Graaawr!!
Monster
401501001_1_a
Thanks, Argo.
Kirito
401500901_21_a
I'll do what yer payin' me ta do.
But I won't like it.
Argo
401500901_20_a
Yeah, got it. Whatever.
The customer's always right,
'n' all that garbage.
Argo
401500901_19_a
Then I'll sweep in with the
Moonlit Black Cats and finish it
off. Got it?
Kirito
401500901_18_a
L-Look, just do it, okay? Help me
bring it to half health and then
get out of there.
Kirito
401500901_17_a
Kii-boy, dude... Get a grip.
Argo
401500901_16_a
No, that's not it at all...
Well...maybe it is...a little...
Kirito
401500901_15_a
Ya enjoyin' babysittin' those
noobs? Or does helpin' 'em make ya
feel good about yerself?
Argo
401500901_14_a
The hell? Since when did ya
become such a goody two-shoes?
Argo
401500901_13_a
N-No, that's not good enough.
They need to do it themselves...
To believe in themselves...
Kirito
401500901_12_a
If yer buddies ain't up to the
task, just let me handle it.
Argo
401500901_11_a
Why not just tell those Moony
Black whatever ya call 'em the
truth?
Argo
401500901_10_a
Why ya hirin' me ta help ya work
over that monster ya had me look
into before the team shows up?
Argo
401500901_9_a
It just doesn't add up.
Argo
401500901_8_a
Wh-What? What's got you so out
of sorts?
Kirito
401500901_7_a
Grr...
Argo
401500901_6_a
I know that too.
Kirito
401500901_5_a
Listen, kid. I'm an info broker.
Not a merc or an assassin.
Argo
401500901_4_a
Yeah, I know.
Kirito
401500901_3_a
Kirito
401500901_2_a
bg_03_field_wolf
Uh, Kii-boy... This is gonna cost
ya an arm and a leg, ya know...
Argo
401500901_1_a
Kirito...
Sachi
401500801_19_a
Of course we can. And don't worry,
Sachi. I'll protect you...and all
the Moonlit Black Cats.
Kirito
401500801_18_a
Hey...Kirito? This event monster...
Can we really beat it?
Sachi
401500801_17_a
...
Kirito
401500801_16_a
...
Sachi
401500801_15_a
S-Sure...
Kirito
401500801_14_a
This is great! I'll go tell Tetsuo
and the others right now!
Keita
401500801_13_a
You're right, Kirito. With this
much Col, our dreams of a guild
house of our own aren't far off.
Keita
401500801_12_a
Hmm... Interesting. It is tough,
but... WHOA! It drops crazy cash!
Keita
401500801_11_a
Sure. Right here...
Kirito
401500801_10_a
I trust your judgment. If you say
we can beat it, we can. But can I
see its stats, just in case?
Keita
401500801_9_a
Yeah, it is powerful... But don't
worry! I'm positive that we're
strong enough to beat it.
Kirito
401500801_8_a
A-Aren't those like...really,
really powerful? I'm not too
sure about this...
Sachi
401500801_7_a
Really?!
But...event monster?
Keita
401500801_6_a
I finally got it! Our big break!
An event monster that drops
a mountain of Col!
Kirito
401500801_5_a
Kirito, what's up?
Keita
401500801_4_a
Sachi
401500801_3_a
Keita
401500801_2_a
bg_03_pub
Keita, Sachi!
Kirito
401500801_1_a
Okay, I'll go see if I can learn
anything. Be back in a bit.
Kirito
401500701_26_a
Reeeaaally now...
Sachi
401500701_25_a
Uh, yeah... Just someone I met
right after I first dived in.
Kind of a love-hate relationship.
Kirito
401500701_24_a
An info broker?
Kirito, you know one?
Sachi
401500701_23_a
Good idea, Kirito!
Keita
401500701_22_a
But I'll ask an info broker if
they know any quests that can help
us make a bundle quick.
Kirito
401500701_21_a
Ha ha... I think our only option's
to keep beating up monsters.
Kirito
401500701_20_a
Uh... I did? Riiight.
Must have forgotten.
Keita
401500701_19_a
Keita, how dare you! You know how
good I am! You said so a while
back!
Sachi
401500701_18_a
Grrr!
Sachi
401500701_17_a
Sachi, your singing voice is like
nails on a chalkboard.
Keita
401500701_16_a
Oh! Another idea! I could sing,
like a bard! I'm an AWESOME
singer!
Sachi
401500701_15_a
Yeah, I guess you're right...
Keita
401500701_14_a
It'd be tough to compete against
the horde of already established
businesses...
Kirito
401500701_13_a
The economy in SAO's already
pretty saturated...
Kirito
401500701_12_a
Yeah, totally! That sounds great!
Sachi
401500701_11_a
You mean like starting a business?
An item or weapon shop or
something?
Keita
401500701_10_a
Isn't there some way we can
earn tons of cash?
Sachi
401500701_9_a
No matter how small it is, a house
is still a house. Just like in the
real world, that's expensive.
Kirito
401500701_8_a
Yeah, I don't doubt it.
Kirito
401500701_7_a
Y-Yeah... All these houses are
just WAY too expensive...
Keita
401500701_6_a
Wait, let me guess. It's the house
for our guild, right?
Kirito
401500701_5_a
Keita, what's with all the
groaning?
Sachi
401500701_4_a
Kirito
401500701_3_a
Sachi
401500701_2_a
bg_03_pub
Ugh... Hmm...
Keita
401500701_1_a
Sachi... Sorry, but this world
just isn't that sort of place...
Kirito
401500601_26_a
...
Kirito
401500601_25_a
Huh? S-Sachi?! What gives?!
Kirito
401500601_24_a
Ugh! Forget it! Whatever, Kirito.
What. Ever.
Sachi
401500601_23_a
...
Kirito
401500601_22_a
All I wanted was to have a room
like I did back home, and hang out
with everyone...
Sachi
401500601_21_a
Ah, whatever.
Sachi
401500601_20_a
N-No, not at all!
Kirito
401500601_19_a
I kinda feel like I've been
throwing a stupid temper tantrum
over this whole thing now...
Sachi
401500601_18_a
You...do?
Kirito
401500601_17_a
I see...
Sachi
401500601_16_a
...
Sachi
401500601_15_a
It's the leader's decision to
make, and I have to respect that.
Kirito
401500601_14_a
It's true. I was against it at
first. But...honestly, I'm new
here. I was out of line.
Kirito
401500601_13_a
O-Oh... Well, I guess there's
no denying it, then.
Kirito
401500601_12_a
W-Well... Kinda, yeah.
Sorry...
Sachi
401500601_11_a
Urk...!
Sachi
401500601_10_a
Sachi... You, uh, didn't happen to
overhear me and Keita talking,
did you?
Kirito
401500601_9_a
I'm not talking about that.
What I want to know is how
YOU feel about it, personally.
Sachi
401500601_8_a
Besides, Keita made the call.
I'm not going to question him...
Kirito
401500601_7_a
Umm, how do I put this... From a
team makeup standpoint,
it does make sense...
Kirito
401500601_6_a
Urk...!
Kirito
401500601_5_a
How do you really feel about me
shifting to the front lines?
Sachi
401500601_4_a
Yeah, what is it?
Kirito
401500601_3_a
Kirito
401500601_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_sao
Kirito...
Sachi
401500601_1_a
Hahaha...
Kirito
401500501_30_a
N-No, I'm not! Hmph!
Sachi
401500501_29_a
Wow, Sachi, you are one demanding
person.
Keita
401500501_28_a
Well, I want a monitor that we
can all look at.
Sachi
401500501_27_a
Oh yeah, nice idea, Kirito!
Keita
401500501_26_a
Heh, well, why not just pull up a
hollow keyboard?
Kirito
401500501_25_a
Um, Sachi? I'm pretty sure SAO
doesn't have computers...
Keita
401500501_24_a
Oh, idea! Let's get a computer for
the living room! To make it feel
like home. A real world home.
Sachi
401500501_23_a
Have fun.
Kirito
401500501_22_a
You do?! Alright! I'm going to go
look into it right now!
Keita
401500501_21_a
But honestly, if you're just
thinking of getting us a place to
hang out, I think it's doable.
Kirito
401500501_20_a
Hahaha...
Kirito
401500501_19_a
You are, huh?! Well, you could've
fooled me!
Sachi
401500501_18_a
H-Hey, I'm aware that you're a
girl! Sheesh!
Keita
401500501_17_a
Maybe you've forgotten, but I am
the only girl in the guild! I need
my privacy!
Sachi
401500501_16_a
Oh! If we're getting a house,
I demand a room of my own!
Sachi
401500501_15_a
I'm just thinking we get a small,
cozy house somewhere. Something
that fits our guild.
Keita
401500501_14_a
Anyway, I'm not saying we build
our own massive HQ like the big
guilds have.
Keita
401500501_13_a
Uh-huh. Right.
Sachi
401500501_12_a
Um... W-Well, you see...
I have this friend... He told me.
Kirito
401500501_11_a
But, Kirito, you've never been in
a guild before, right? How do you
know that?
Sachi
401500501_10_a
I don't know the details, but I'm
sure it costs a ridiculous amount
of Col...
Kirito
401500501_9_a
It would be cool, but it's not
going to be easy...
Kirito
401500501_8_a
Exactly! And that's why I thought
that the Moonlit Black Cats needed
one of their very own too!
Keita
401500501_7_a
I heard that every guild in the
Assault Team had one of their
own...
Sachi
401500501_6_a
You mean like a headquarters for
our guild, right?
Sachi
401500501_5_a
Yeah. I heard Tetsuo and the
others talking about it.
Keita
401500501_4_a
Sachi
401500501_3_a
Keita
401500501_2_a
bg_03_pub
You want to buy a house for the
guild?
Kirito
401500501_1_a
...
Sachi
401500401_31_a
Kirito
401500401_30_a
Yeah!
Keita
401500401_29_a
No problem! Now let's go kick
some more monster butt!
Kirito
401500401_28_a
Thanks, Kirito! I'm really happy
to hear that!
Keita
401500401_27_a
So whatever you think is best,
know that you'll have my full
support.
Kirito
401500401_26_a
You're the one who should decide
what's right for the guild.
Kirito
401500401_25_a
You're the leader of the Moonlit
Black Cats.
Kirito
401500401_24_a
I understand. I think I was a bit
too sure that I was right, too.
Kirito
401500401_23_a
Keita...
Kirito
401500401_22_a
And...I want her to know she's
contributing. That she's important
to the guild
and to her friends.
Keita
401500401_21_a
All I want is to make us more
effective as a team.
Keita
401500401_20_a
It's foolish to just assume that
the back's the safest place to be.
Kirito
401500401_19_a
And sometimes the people in back
get rushed by hordes of monsters.
Kirito
401500401_18_a
I know. Frontline players tend
to have a lot more health and
defense, so they're tougher.
Kirito
401500401_17_a
the danger's the same.
Front or back, there's no
real safe spot, you know?
Keita
401500401_16_a
But I think you understand that
no matter what role you play in an
MMO,
Keita
401500401_15_a
Y-Yeah... It's not that I want to
put her in danger or anything...
Keita
401500401_14_a
You want to talk about putting
her up front again, right?
Kirito
401500401_13_a
It's Sachi, right?
Kirito
401500401_12_a
Well... I really value your
advice, and it's always spot on,
but...
Keita
401500401_11_a
Everything all right?
Kirito
401500401_10_a
...
Keita
401500401_9_a
You do? Great! I'm glad you're
on board with it.
Keita
401500401_8_a
Hmm... I think it should be okay.
Kirito
401500401_7_a
I want to move our primary
leveling spot up a level.
What do you think, Kirito?
Keita
401500401_6_a
Ha ha, don't be so modest!
Oh yeah, I have a proposal!
Keita
401500401_5_a
Hey, no need for that...
I didn't do anything.
You all worked for it.
Kirito
401500401_4_a
We owe you big time!
Keita
401500401_3_a
Kirito
401500401_2_a
bg_01_field
Kirito! It's all thanks to you
that we've leveled again!
Keita
401500401_1_a
...
Kirito
401500301_23_a
you're obviously the strongest one
here. Besides, you make a good
point...
Keita
401500301_22_a
Even if your level's only a bit
higher than ours,
Keita
401500301_21_a
No... No, it's okay.
Keita
401500301_20_a
Oh, uh... Sorry... I'm new here.
I shouldn't have gone and run
my mouth like that...
Kirito
401500301_19_a
...
Keita
401500301_18_a
And besides, did you ever think
that the rest of the guild might
not want that?
Kirito
401500301_17_a
I think making it into the Assault
Team with just a bit of hard work
is unrealistic.
Kirito
401500301_16_a
What are you talking about?
Keita
401500301_15_a
You're shooting for the stars, and
that's great. Just don't sacrifice
what you have to get there.
Kirito
401500301_14_a
Keita, listen...
Kirito
401500301_13_a
No, I mean it might be better for
our strategy in general.
Keita
401500301_12_a
Is that what you think she wants?
Kirito
401500301_11_a
So I guess we should have her
switch back to the spear, huh?
Keita
401500301_10_a
Yeah...
You're right, Kirito.
Keita
401500301_9_a
And I think Sachi's under too much
pressure up front. She's not
handling it well.
Kirito
401500301_8_a
Keita, I'm fine keeping our party
setup the way it is.
Kirito
401500301_7_a
W-Well...yeah.
Keita
401500301_6_a
Listen, I get it. You're concerned
that you're counting too much on
me, right?
Kirito
401500301_5_a
But still...
Keita
401500301_4_a
N-No, that's not what I meant.
I'm just saying we don't need to
rush it. Let's take it slow.
Kirito
401500301_3_a
Kirito
401500301_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Huh...? You're saying Sachi
shouldn't fight up front?
Keita
401500301_1_a
...
Sachi
401500201_22_a
Yeah, sounds good.
Kirito
401500201_21_a
How 'bout taking a break from all
the practice? Everyone's hanging
out nearby.
Keita
401500201_20_a
Keita
Kirito
401500201_19_a
Sachi
401500201_18_a
Oh, there they are!
Keita
401500201_17_a
Yeah, but I wasn't even fighting.
I was so scared, I couldn't even
move...
Sachi
401500201_16_a
Well, it was weak... But that's
just how it is when you're
learning a new weapon.
Kirito
401500201_15_a
That monster was really low-level,
right? But I couldn't even handle
it...
Sachi
401500201_14_a
Y-Yeah, I hope... But I just don't
think I'm cut out for this.
Sachi
401500201_13_a
You'll get there eventually.
Kirito
401500201_12_a
Hey, don't worry about it.
You just switched to the
one-handed sword.
Kirito
401500201_11_a
S-Sorry about that, Kirito...
Sachi
401500201_10_a
Phew...
Kirito
401500201_9_a
Grrrnk!
Monster
401500201_8_a
Huh?!
Sachi
401500201_7_a
Hrrragh!
Kirito
401500201_6_a
Sachi
401500201_5_a
I'm not going to make it in time!
Kirito
401500201_4_a
Graaawr!
Monster
401500201_3_a
Wait, I should do what...?
Uh...huh?!
Sachi
401500201_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Sachi! Now! Switch!
Kirito
401500201_1_a
Oh... Right, sure I am.
Klein
401500101_22_a
If you're willing to listen,
I'm willing to talk.
Kirito
401500101_21_a
And Klein... I haven't really told
you the whole story either, huh?
Kirito
401500101_20_a
I spoke to her about it...briefly.
But you're right... I'll be more
open with her.
Kirito
401500101_19_a
Or have you not told her about
what happened at all?
Klein
401500101_18_a
If you have to run off, at least
tell Asuna where you're going.
She's worried sick.
Klein
401500101_17_a
If you insist... Just don't beat
yourself up, okay? And, umm...
Well...
Klein
401500101_16_a
I... I'm just trying to deal with
it in my own way.
Kirito
401500101_15_a
Thanks, Klein.
But...I'm okay, really.
Kirito
401500101_14_a
The "Moonlit Black Cats," right?
Kirito... I don't think they
Klein
401500101_13_a
Still...I wanted to come here...
To remember them...
Kirito
401500101_12_a
It may look similar, but it's not
the same. Not the place where
they...
Kirito
401500101_11_a
Yeah... New Aincrad is just a copy:
a recreation of Aincrad in ALO.
Kirito
401500101_10_a
Those flowers... They're for them,
huh?
Klein
401500101_9_a
I...see...
Kirito
401500101_8_a
Asuna and the others said you were
missing. So I thought, if I was
Kirito, where would I be?
Klein
401500101_7_a
It's Christmas, dude. Everyone's
partying, but I couldn't reach
you. I was worried, man.
Klein
401500101_6_a
Wha
? K-Klein? What are you
doing here?
Kirito
401500101_5_a
There you are, K-dawg. I thought
I'd find you here.
Klein
401500101_4_a
And...
Kirito
401500101_3_a
Keita, Tetsuo, Ducker, Sasamaru...
Kirito
401500101_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
...
Kirito
401500101_1_a
ああ、わかったよ
キリト
401401301_28_a
うん、いいね
行こう、キリトくん
アスナ
401401301_27_a
クリスマスソングを
歌ってくれるみたいですよ!
一緒に聴きに行きませんか?
シリカ
401401301_26_a
皆さん!
あっちで子供たちが今回のお礼に
シリカ
401401301_25_a
アスナ
401401301_24_a
シリカ
401401301_23_a
ふふっ、そんな感じね
401401301_22_a
キリト
401401301_21_a
あはは、ぼくの勝ち～!
401401301_20_a
いてっ!
やったな、こいつー!
キリト
401401301_19_a
キリト
401401301_18_a
うりゃあ!
401401301_17_a
シリカ
401401301_16_a
リーファ
401401301_15_a
お世話というより……
友達だと思われてるんじゃないの、
あれ?
シノン
401401301_14_a
ふふっ、お兄ちゃん
すっかり子供たちのお世話にも
慣れた感じだね
リーファ
401401301_13_a
ああ、いいぜ!
ただし俺も手を抜かないからな～!
キリト
401401301_12_a
黒のおにいちゃん!
もらったこの剣のおもちゃで
チャンバラやろうよ!
401401301_11_a
キリト
401401301_10_a
キリトくん、家に帰ったら、
ユイちゃんにもプレゼント
渡さないとね
アスナ
401401301_9_a
はは、そうだな
こうして子供たちに喜んで
もらうのも……悪くないな
キリト
401401301_8_a
なんだか本当に
サンタさんになっちゃった
みたいですね～
シリカ
401401301_7_a
ふふっ、いえいえ
どういたしまして
アスナ
401401301_6_a
あたしのほしかった絵本だわ!
おにーちゃん、おねーちゃん
ありがとう!
401401301_5_a
キリト
401401301_4_a
シリカ
401401301_3_a
アスナ
401401301_2_a
bg_event_alne_christmas
うわっ!
ボクが欲しかった怪獣だ!
401401301_1_a
うん!
アスナ
401401201_31_a
よし……
じゃあ残りのプレゼントも
回収したら、町に戻ろう!
キリト
401401201_30_a
これで無事に
子供たちに渡せるわね!
401401201_29_a
あっ、
ブラックサンタに取られてた
プレゼントも全部元通りになったわ
401401201_28_a
ああ、子供たちの言葉を信じた
からこそ、このクエストは
無事にクリアできるんだな
キリト
401401201_27_a
子供たちだけじゃなく……
全ての人にとって……
シノン
401401201_26_a
仮想世界は本当に夢を
現実にするのね……
シノン
401401201_25_a
うふふっ、あたしもです!
シリカ
401401201_24_a
でもわたし……えへへ、なんだか
本物のサンタさんに出会えて嬉しいな
アスナ
401401201_23_a
ほっほっ、
世話をかけたようじゃのう
サンタクロース
401401201_22_a
なるほど……
そういうことだったんだ
リーファ
401401201_21_a
こうして協力してもらえる
みたいなんだよ
キリト
401401201_20_a
その存在に気づいたプレイヤーが
子供たちに紹介された場合のみ、
キリト
401401201_19_a
子供たちから聞いたんだ
元々子供の前だけにPOPする設定の
NPCみたいなんだが、
キリト
401401201_18_a
でもキリト、どうやって
このNPCを見つけてきたの?
シノン
401401201_17_a
……ああ
キリト
401401201_16_a
あはは、歌と一緒なんだね～
ユウキ
401401201_15_a
それって……
赤鼻のトナカイ……ですか?
シリカ
401401201_14_a
ほっほっほっ
ワシの相棒のトナカイの鼻が、
周囲を明るく照らしてくれるのじゃ
サンタクロース
401401201_13_a
ああ、この人のおかげだ
キリト
401401201_12_a
ええと……じゃあ、
ブラックサンタの空を暗くする術を
解いてくれたのも……
401401201_11_a
今回はワシの名を騙る悪党が
いたと聞いて、こうして加勢に
駆けつけてきたというわけじゃ
サンタクロース
401401201_10_a
子供たちだけが……?
アスナ
401401201_9_a
本来、子供たちだけが
会うことができるNPCなんだ
キリト
401401201_8_a
ああ、
この人はALOのサンタクロース
キリト
401401201_7_a
キ、キリトくん……
その人って……
アスナ
401401201_6_a
ふぅ……倒せたか
なんとか間に合ったな
キリト
401401201_5_a
401401201_4_a
アスナ
401401201_3_a
キリト
401401201_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
ウゲエエエエッ!!
ブラックサンタ
401401201_1_a
ええ!
シノン
401401101_37_a
みんな、バトル開始だ!
キリト
401401101_36_a
こうなっては仕方ない!
皆殺しにするまで!
ブラックサンタ
401401101_35_a
グハハハハッ!
ブラックサンタ
401401101_34_a
今回のフラグMob……
ブラックサンタだ!!
キリト
401401101_33_a
そしてそこでプレゼントを
盗もうとしてるのが……
キリト
401401101_32_a
ほっほっほっ……
サンタクロース
401401101_31_a
ははは、正確には
俺が連れてきたのが
本物のサンタクロース
キリト
401401101_30_a
さ、サンタさんが二人います!
シリカ
401401101_29_a
き、キリト!
その隣の人、なによ!?
401401101_28_a
って……えええっ!?
リーファ
401401101_27_a
遅くなってすまなかった
キリト
401401101_26_a
お兄ちゃん!
リーファ
401401101_25_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
えっ……空が明るく……!?
き、キリトくん!?
アスナ
401401101_24_a
待たせたな、みんな
???
401401101_23_a
このままだと前と同じことに
なっちゃいますよ!
シリカ
401401101_22_a
鈴の音がどんどん
近づいてきました!
リーファ
401401101_21_a
インプでも……
やっぱりダメなんだね
アスナ
401401101_20_a
と、とは言っても……
この暗さ……インプの暗視の力でも、
見えないよ!
ユウキ
401401101_19_a
みんな、
そりの周囲を防衛するんだよ!
アスナ
401401101_18_a
くっ……
またあの鈴の音が
聞こえてきましたよ!
リーファ
401401101_17_a
また……空が暗く……!
シノン
401401101_16_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas_night
あっ!
シリカ
401401101_15_a
そうですね……
シリカ
401401101_14_a
今はキリトくんを信じて、
ちょっと待ってみようよ
アスナ
401401101_13_a
な、なんかまだ
確証がないみたいなこと
言ってたけど……
アスナ
401401101_12_a
もーっ、
アイディアあるならあるで、
なんで教えてくれないのよー!
401401101_11_a
キリトにはなにか
秘策があるってこと?
ユウキ
401401101_10_a
前と同じように
罠を張っててくれって言って……
どっかに出かけちゃったんです
リーファ
401401101_9_a
はい、お兄ちゃんってば、
今度こそはブラックサンタを
捕まえてみせるから、
リーファ
401401101_8_a
それは私たちも
散々キリトに言ったんだけどね……
シノン
401401101_7_a
これじゃあ
またプレゼントを奪われて、
逃げられるだけなんじゃないの?
401401101_6_a
は、はい……
シリカ
401401101_5_a
大丈夫なのかしら?
これってこの前の作戦と同じでしょ?
401401101_4_a
シノン
401401101_3_a
シリカ
401401101_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
………………
401401101_1_a
あ、ああ
会いたい!
キリト
401401001_19_a
いいよ～
黒のおにいちゃんも
サンタさんに会いたいの?
401401001_18_a
そ、その話もう少し詳しく
聞かせてくれないか?
キリト
401401001_17_a
うん、ぼくも会ったことあるし、
みんなも会ったって言ってるよ～
401401001_16_a
そのサンタさん、
本当にALOにいるのか?
キリト
401401001_15_a
ブラックサンタ……
のことでもなさそうだな……
キリト
401401001_14_a
ううん、違うよ!
赤い服に白い、優しそうな
オヒゲのおじいちゃんだよ!
401401001_13_a
サンタさん……
それって俺たちプレゼントを
準備してるプレイヤーのことか?
キリト
401401001_12_a
でもこのせかいにも、
ちゃんとサンタさんは
いたんだねー!
401401001_11_a
あ、ああ
キリト
401401001_10_a
そっか～
楽しみにしてるね!
401401001_9_a
今準備中なんだ
キリト
401401001_8_a
えっ、えと……その……
もう少し待ってくれ
キリト
401401001_7_a
おにいちゃん、プレゼントまだー?
401401001_6_a
うん!
401401001_5_a
お、おう……元気か?
キリト
401401001_4_a
あっ、黒のおにいちゃんだ!
こんにちは!
401401001_3_a
ブラックサンタを
取り押さえて倒すには……
どうしたものか……
キリト
401401001_2_a
bg_event_alne_christmas
うーむぅ……
キリト
401401001_1_a
うーん……どうすりゃいいんだ……
キリト
401400901_22_a
そうなんだよなぁ……
同じように待ち伏せしても、
暗くさせられると二の舞だし……
キリト
401400901_21_a
あとはどうやって
その悪いサンタさんを
捕まえるかですが……
シリカ
401400901_20_a
アスナ
401400901_19_a
今回は
敵Mobで間違いないだろう
キリト
401400901_18_a
まあプレイヤー同士で競い
合ってるわけで、そういう妨害行為も
否定できなかったが……
キリト
401400901_17_a
プレゼントを盗んでたのが、
プレイヤーだったら……
なんか嫌だなって思っててね
アスナ
401400901_16_a
泥棒の正体が……
NPCで良かったって思ったの
万が一子供たちの
アスナ
401400901_15_a
あっ、ご、ごめんね
事件は全然解決してないのに
アスナ
401400901_14_a
アスナさん、今なんか一瞬
安堵したような顔しませんでした?
リーファ
401400901_13_a
ふーっ……
アスナ
401400901_12_a
そのブラックサンタってのが……
今回の事件の首謀者なんだな
キリト
401400901_11_a
確かに的を射てるわね、その名前
周囲を暗くする能力もあったし
シノン
401400901_10_a
邪悪な感じか～
じゃあ仮にブラックサンタとでも
名付けておこっか?
ユウキ
401400901_9_a
……邪悪な感じがしたな
キリト
401400901_8_a
ああ、デザインは近いが、
絵本とかで見るようなサンタとは
似ても似つかない……
キリト
401400901_7_a
近くで見た感じ……
なんというか……
黒いサンタって感じだったわね
シノン
401400901_6_a
結局あの後飛んで追いましたけど、
追いつけませんでしたね……
リーファ
401400901_5_a
ま、まああれを本物と呼ぶべきかは、
ちょっと怪しいけどね……
アスナ
401400901_4_a
リーファ
401400901_3_a
アスナ
401400901_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
なんてこと……
プレゼントを盗んでたのが、
まさか本物のサンタだったなんて……
401400901_1_a
う、うん!
リーファ
401400801_30_a
くっ……あいつが犯人か!
みんな追うぞ!!
キリト
401400801_29_a
罠に仕掛けておいたプレゼントが……
無くなってる!!
アスナ
401400801_28_a
アスナ!
キリト
401400801_27_a
み、みんな!
アスナ
401400801_26_a
黒い……サンタクロースの後ろ姿!?
リーファ
401400801_25_a
あれは……!
キリト
401400801_24_a
二人ともあの雲の向こうを見て!
シノン
401400801_23_a
……!
キリト
401400801_22_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
キリト、リーファ!
空の色が元通りになってきたわよ!
シノン
401400801_21_a
ヤバいな……それってつまり……!
キリト
401400801_20_a
……!
今度は鈴の音が遠ざかっていってる!
リーファ
401400801_19_a
なにが起きてるんだ……?
キリト
401400801_18_a
しかもここ、光系の魔法が
使えない空間になってるみたいで、
明かりで照らせないみたいです
リーファ
401400801_17_a
でもこの暗さだから
気をつけないとね……
シノン
401400801_16_a
なんだと……
俺たちも行くぞ!
キリト
401400801_15_a
はい!
この音、多分……罠のために
設置したそりに近づいてます!
リーファ
401400801_14_a
聴力に優れたシルフだから、
リーファは先に気づけたのね
シノン
401400801_13_a
はっ!
確かに遠くから……シャンシャンと
鈴の音が近づいてくる……!
キリト
401400801_12_a
いや俺にはそんな音聞こえ……
キリト
401400801_11_a
鈴の音……?
シノン
401400801_10_a
急に暗くなった瞬間から、
鈴の音が聞こえてきたんだけど、
気づいてる!?
リーファ
401400801_9_a
スグ、これは一体……!?
キリト
401400801_8_a
お、お兄ちゃん!
シノンさん!
リーファ
401400801_7_a
そ、それもそうだよな
キリト
401400801_6_a
こんな急に日が暮れるわけ
ないでしょ!
シノン
401400801_5_a
ど、どういうことだ!?
夜になったわけじゃない……よな?
キリト
401400801_4_a
な、なによこれ……!
突然空が暗くなった!?
シノン
401400801_3_a
シノン
401400801_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas_night
えっ!?
キリト
401400801_1_a
任せて
この辺に近づいてくる奴がいたら、
絶対に見逃さないから
シノン
401400701_19_a
はは、わかってるよ
ケットシーとしての眼力、
期待してるぜ
キリト
401400701_18_a
別にこのやり方を
否定したつもりじゃないわ
可能性の話をしてただけで……
シノン
401400701_17_a
ええ……
シノン
401400701_16_a
敵を捕えようとするプレイヤーには
演出があることを期待して、
今は少しこのやり方を試してみよう
キリト
401400701_15_a
でも現状やれることも
少ないからな……
キリト
401400701_14_a
まあ……そうね
シノン
401400701_13_a
だからこうして罠を張って待ち
構えても、敵は出てこないんじゃ
ないかって言いたいんだろ?
キリト
401400701_12_a
ええ、プレイヤーが見ていないのに、
盗む過程の演出を作る必要なんて
ないからね
シノン
401400701_11_a
そりの荷車からプレゼントが
瞬時に消えただけだろう
キリト
401400701_10_a
現実であれば
盗んだ誰かがいるはずだが、
仮想世界で起きた事象としては、
キリト
401400701_9_a
確かにそりからプレゼントは
無くなったが、これはあくまで
用意されたシナリオだ
キリト
401400701_8_a
シノンの言いたいことはわかる
キリト
401400701_7_a
本当にプレゼントの盗人が
現れるのかしら……?
シノン
401400701_6_a
今、私たちは少し距離を取って、
そりの四方を囲うように
身を潜めているけど……
シノン
401400701_5_a
ここは郊外の見渡す限りの雪原……
そりに近づく者がいれば、
すぐにわかる
キリト
401400701_4_a
……さて、どう出るかしらね
シノン
401400701_3_a
シノン

………………
キリト
401400701_1_a
ああ……
さて、どうしたものか……
キリト
401400601_25_a
プレゼント奪われちゃったなんて……
とてもあの子たちには
聞かせられないね……
アスナ
401400601_24_a
………………
キリト
401400601_23_a
うん!
401400601_22_a
へー、そうなんだ～
じゃあこのせかいだと、おにいちゃん
たちがサンタさんなんだね～
401400601_21_a
だからプレゼントはぷれいやーの
おにいちゃんたちがくれるんだ
401400601_20_a
サンタさんはこのせかいには
いないんだよ
401400601_19_a
サンタさんからのプレゼント、
たのしみだな～
401400601_18_a
クリアどころか
まともに集められてる人自体、
ほとんどいないっぽいわね……
シノン
401400601_17_a
そうみたいね
ネットのBBSや攻略サイトでも
このことが話題になってるわ……
シノン
401400601_16_a
どうやら運営はそう簡単には
集めさせるつもりはないらしいな
キリト
401400601_15_a
所有者が目を離した隙に
プレゼントは盗まれる……
キリト
401400601_14_a
なるほど……
そり自体はストレージにしまえない
街の中にも運べない……
キリト
401400601_13_a
はい、さっきの一個も
なくなっちゃってました……
シリカ
401400601_12_a
まさか……
401400601_11_a
今ちょっと不安になって
街の入り口まで戻って
あたし達のそりを見てきたら……
シリカ
401400601_10_a
どうしたの、シリカ?
401400601_9_a
リ、リズさん!
大変です!
シリカ
401400601_8_a
全部取られた後で、最後に一つ
手に入れた状態でここに来たから
まだ1個だけ持ってるけど……
401400601_7_a
なんてこと……
あたしとシリカも全く同じよ……
幸いあたし達は
401400601_6_a
それも途中で無くなってて……
アスナ
401400601_5_a
う、うん……
その後で別のプレゼントも
幾つかゲットしたんだけど……
アスナ
401400601_4_a
401400601_3_a

bg_event_alne_christmas
えっ!?
じゃあアスナ達も同じ目に
遭ったの!?
ユウキ
401400601_1_a
どういうことなんだ……!?
キリト
401400501_22_a
さっきまで結構膨れてたのに……!
今は中に何も入ってないよ、
しぼんでるもん!
アスナ
401400501_21_a
うん!
アスナ
401400501_20_a
えっ!?
中身が入ってない……!?
キリト
401400501_19_a
キ、キリトくん!
そりの荷車の白い袋が……!
アスナ
401400501_18_a
アスナ、どうした?
キリト
401400501_17_a
……あっ!
アスナ
401400501_16_a
まあ……確かに、言われてみれば
アスナ
401400501_15_a
なんでわざわざそんな
プレゼント保管用の……
移動手段を用意したんだろってな
キリト
401400501_14_a
別にストレージに入れる
仕様にだってできるだろ?
キリト
401400501_13_a
どうしたの?
アスナ
401400501_12_a
そうだな……
でも……
キリト
401400501_11_a
荷物を積めるようになってるんだよね
自分のストレージに入れなくて
済むのは、助かるよね
アスナ
401400501_10_a
このイベントに参加してるプレイヤー
全員に割り当てられて、
荷車にはいくらでも
アスナ
401400501_9_a
そうだね
でも便利だよね
あのトナカイのそり
アスナ
401400501_8_a
早速玄関に待機させている
トナカイのそりの荷車に入れておこう
キリト
401400501_7_a
うん!
アスナ
401400501_6_a
ああ、
これで四つ目のプレゼントゲットだ
キリト

希望を叶えられるか……
リーファ

そっか
ボクらプレイヤーが子供たちの
サンタさんになるってことなんだね!
ユウキ
401400401_16_a
あとは子供が好きな物の
お約束ということで、
スイーツ系もあるみたいですよ
シリカ
401400401_15_a
女の子ならぬいぐるみとか、
男の子は攻撃力のない模造刀みたいな
武器とか……そんな感じかな
アスナ
401400401_14_a
具体的にはどんな物があるの?
401400401_13_a
はい、そこは幾つかの選択肢を
用意して、子供たちに選んでもらう
ってやり方にしたみたいです
リーファ
401400401_12_a
子供の欲しがるものが
ALOアイテムにあるの?
シノン
401400401_11_a
というのが、今回の趣旨になります
リーファ
401400401_10_a
子供たちから予め欲しいアイテムを
ヒアリングしているので、
それらを用意してプレゼントする……

今回はVR体験のために

クリスマスイベントを行います
リーファ

確かにそうだな……
キリト

この世界の良さが広まれば
いいなって思っちゃうね
アスナ
401400301_17_a
あの子たちを利用するわけじゃ
ないけど、こういうことからでも、
少しずつ
アスナ
401400301_16_a
VRMMOってSAO事件以来、
なにかと世間から叩かれがちだから、
アスナ
401400301_15_a
そんなことないと思うよ
みんなすごく満足げな顔して
帰っていったから
リーファ
401400301_14_a
そうか……?
ただの玩具にされてた
だけのような……
キリト
401400301_13_a
うふふっ、キリトさん
子供たちの心をばっちり
掴んでましたね
シリカ
401400301_12_a
まったく……子供ってやつは、
本当に底なしの体力だよな
遊ぶことに命かけてるというか……
キリト
401400301_11_a
アバターが年取るわけないだろ……
だが生気を持っていかれた気はするな
キリト
401400301_10_a
お兄ちゃん、心なしか老けてみえるよ

はい!
シリカ
401400201_33_a
ふふっ、じゃあそろそろ
キリトくんの手伝いに行こうか
アスナ
401400201_32_a
確かに
あー、あたしもあれくらいの時に、
VR体験しとけば良かったな
リーファ
401400201_31_a
あの子たちから見れば、
この仮想世界は
ホントの夢の世界なんでしょうね
シリカ
401400201_30_a
そうですね

キャハハ!
401400201_24_a
うぐあっ!
さすがに三人も乗っかっられると、
飛ぶのは無理だ～!
キリト
401400201_23_a
おにいちゃんだっこ!
空とんで～!
401400201_22_a
お前たちそこで見てないで
こっち手伝ってくれ～!

子供が苦手っていうのは、
ホントだったんですね～

いてて!
引っ張るな～!
キリト
401400201_11_a
いや本物みたいじゃなくて
この世界では本物で……
キリト
401400201_10_a
わ～!
このハネほんものみたい～!
401400201_9_a
いてっ!
キリト
401400201_8_a
あ、ああ
キミ達のアバターには翅はないけど、
俺たちが抱きかかえて飛ぶことなら
キリト
401400201_7_a
すごいすごい!
401400201_6_a
このハネで飛べるの～!?
401400201_5_a
こ、これは貸せないんだ……
危険だからな……
キリト
401400201_4_a
その剣、かして～!
401400201_3_a
キリト

bg_event_alne_christmas
わーっ、
おにいちゃんの剣カッコいい!
401400201_1_a
それを苦手って言うんだよ……
401400101_23_a
ほら、子供の無垢な眼差しで
見つめられると、どう接していいか
わからなくて……!
401400101_22_a
に、苦手なんじゃない!
401400101_21_a
はぁ～
そう言えば……
お兄ちゃん子供の相手苦手だったね
401400101_20_a
子供たちの世話か……
むむむ……
401400101_19_a
一応圏外には出られないらしいし、
戦いに巻き込まれる心配はないって
ことだけど
401400101_18_a
注意喚起が出されてたよ
401400101_17_a
今回のイベントに先んじて、
町中にいる子供たちに
優しく接してあげましょうって
401400101_16_a
俺が……なんで?
401400101_15_a
仮想世界の先輩として
優しく指導してあげなくちゃ
401400101_14_a
子供たちの手を取って
一緒に遊ぶんだよ
401400101_13_a
相手?
どういうことだ?
401400101_12_a
とにかく町中に子供たちが
沢山ダイブしてくるはずだから、
お兄ちゃんちゃんと相手してあげなよ
401400101_11_a
たしかに
俺の知る限りでも最年少はSAO
当時のシリカで12歳くらいだからな
401400101_10_a
そうかもしれないね
基本VRMMOをプレイし始めるの
って、中学生くらいからだもんね
401400101_9_a
利用されてきてるから、
子供のうちに慣れさせて
おこうってことなのか
401400101_8_a
へぇ……
VR技術はただの遊びじゃない
昨今色々な方面で
401400101_7_a
どっかの企業とのタイアップ
みたいだけどね
401400101_6_a
その招待された子供たちは、
村の子供アバターを操作して
クリスマスの雰囲気を楽しむらしいよ
401400101_5_a
VR体験をさせるイベントが
あるんだって
401400101_4_a
うん、今度のクリスマスに
現実から子供たちを招いて、

そして……ありがとう

ミーノス王、

本当に家族になれたのかもしれないな

ふっ、そうね
自動生成クエってのも、
なかなかやるじゃない
シノン

えげつないエピソードのまま
終わるのかと思ってたけど……

あたしちょっと
ウルッと来ちゃいました……
シリカ
401301301_37_a
そうだね……
王様の死を止めることができたのは、
やっぱり家族だったんだね……

生きることにする

タウロス

父上……
あなたと私に血の繋がりは
ありません……
タウロス

じゃがワシは……ワシは……
ミーノス王
401301301_25_a
王として……最期まで
生き方を貫いてほしいのです……
パシパエ
401301301_24_a
それはいけません……
あなたはこの国にとって
まだ無くてはならない存在……
パシパエ
401301301_23_a
おおっ、
ワシも今そなたたちの後を……
ミーノス王
401301301_22_a
私たちは既にこの世の者では
ありません……
パシパエ
401301301_21_a
そしてもう一人は……
もしや我が息子の声なのか……?
ミーノス王

こ、この声は……
我が妻パシパエ……

えっ?

止めるな……これが愚かな王の
せめてもの贖罪なのだ……!

シノン

村に平穏が戻った……
家族を失った……ワシはこの先
もはや生きていく意味などない……
ミーノス王
401301301_12_a
えっ?
アスナ
401301301_11_a
これでワシも妻子の下へと
逝けるということか……

見ものだわ……
ふふっ……
シノン
401301201_25_a
まあでもどちらにしろ
クエスト依頼主があのミーノス王
だから、報告は必要よね
シノン

だから
それは無理だって言ってるだろ……
キリト

あの父親の王様だけ、
生き残ってるわけでしょ?
401301201_19_a
そうだけど……うーん
なんか納得いかない感じ……!

わたしは息子さんがちゃんと母親に
愛されたってことがわかったのは、
良かったかなって思うよ

庇った方がしゃべり出した!?

えっ?

ワ、ワレハ……!

キリトくん……
アスナ
401301101_18_a
なんか俺にはそう見えてさ
そう思ったら……
攻撃できなくなっちまったんだ
キリト
401301101_17_a
ああ、自分を犠牲にしてでも
我が子を守ろうとする母の姿……
キリト
401301101_16_a
さっきの予想って……
もう一方が王妃パシパエ
って……こと?
シノン
401301101_15_a
えっ……?
クライン
401301101_14_a
この庇う姿……
やっぱり……
さっきの予想は当たってたんだ……
キリト
401301101_13_a
い、今のは好機だろーがよ!
お前なにをやって……
クライン
401301101_12_a
なっ!?
クライン
401301101_11_a
………………
キリト
401301101_10_a
構う事ねーぜっ!
二匹ごとぶっ飛ばしちまえ!!!
クライン

やっぱりその戦法で来るのか……!?
キリト
401301101_8_a
くっ……もう一方が庇いに来た!
シノン
401301101_7_a
ヌオオッ!!!
ミノタウロス

やった!
片方が体勢を崩したよ!

私が読んだ本でも、
その辺の記述はなかったわね……
シノン
401301001_21_
う、ううん……
リーファ
401301001_20_a
ミノタウロスを生んだ後に
どうなったのか覚えてるか?
キリト
401301001_19_a
やっぱそうか……
王妃パシパエは神話だと
キリト
401301001_18_a
領主ミーノスの館にいたのも、
王一人だけだったわよ
シノン
401301001_17_a
うん、主要人物の中では……
王妃パシパエ……だね
リーファ
401301001_16_a
シノン、スグ
この神話のエピソードの中で
まだ登場してないのって……
キリト
401301001_15_a
もう一匹の正体……か
キリト
401301001_14_a
せめて一匹だけなら
なんとかなったはずなのによ……
クライン
401301001_13_a
ちくしょー!
そもそもあのもう一匹は
一体なんなんだよ!
クライン
401301001_12_a
ですね!
突破口となる、
別の攻略方法があるとか……?
シリカ
401301001_11_a
なにかしら倒せる手段が
あるんじゃないかしら?
401301001_10_a
でも7人のパーティじゃないと
ここに来られないわけだから、
401301001_9_a
そうね、パラメーターも
強化されてる気がするわ
シノン
401301001_8_a
強いね……
スリュムヘイムのとき以上かも……
アスナ
401301001_7_a
くっ……!
なかなかゲージが減らないな……!

ミノタウロス
401301001_1_a
前の戦いと同じ戦法なのかどうか……
見極めてやる!
キリト
401300901_16_a
よし……!
じゃあまずは敵二体の出方を見るか
キリト
401300901_15_a
へっ、そーいやそうだな
他の奴らはもう諦めちまってる
みたいだし、
クライン
401300901_14_a
戦ってみないとわからないわ
今はそれよりもようやくここまで辿り
つけたことを、喜ぶべきじゃない?
シノン
401300901_13_a
守り合う戦法を使ってきたんだよね
今回も同じ行動パターン
なのかな……?
アスナ
401300901_12_a
片方が物理耐性、もう片方が
魔法耐性に強くて、弱点攻撃を
仕掛けてきたとき、互いに壁になって
アスナ
401300901_11_a
そうだな……
そう言えばあのときのバトルは、
結構厄介だったな
キリト
401300901_10_a
そ、そんなのどっちでもいいわよ!
これってまるで……あのスリュム
ヘイムのときと同じじゃない!
401300901_9_a
息子さんは
双子だったんでしょうか……?
シリカ
401300901_8_a
ど、どういうこった!?
牛頭のバケモノが
二匹もいやがるぞ!!
クライン
401300901_7_a
な、なにっ!?
キリト

ここは心を鬼にして戦わなきゃ、だね
リーファ
401300801_22_a
そうだな、そうしないと、
村人たちも牛の姿から戻せない
キリト
401300801_21_a
きっと戦うことになるはずだから
アスナ
401300801_20_a
つまる所……
もう彼に正気は残っていないって
ことだと思う……
アスナ
401300801_19_a
でもみんな、油断しちゃだめだよ
ミノタウロスは生贄を
欲しているんだから
アスナ
401300801_18_a
そんな境遇で生まれたのに、
こんな場所にずっと閉じ込められてる
なんて、少し可哀想です……
シリカ
401300801_17_a
結果ミノタウロスが生まれた
わけだからな……
キリト
401300801_16_a
ポセイドンの怒りを買い……
王妃へ牛に恋心を抱くような
呪いをかけ、
キリト
401300801_15_a
ポセイドンから借りた牛を
返さなかったミーノス王が、
キリト
401300801_14_a
元はと言えば、この一連の災いって、
あのオッサンが招いたもんだろ?
クライン
401300801_13_a
でもよぉ、
ちょっと不憫じゃねーかその息子
クライン
401300801_12_a
これも神話どおりってわけね
シノン
401300801_11_a
ミーノス王はミノタウロスへの生贄を
数年に一度行っていた……
その数は常に7人……
シノン
401300801_10_a
うん、多分……
アスナ
401300801_9_a
これで迷いの呪法が解かれて、
ダンジョンの最深部まで
辿りつけるんですよね?
シリカ
401300801_8_a
あはは、それにしてもあたし達の
人数もちょうど生贄として
決められた数、7人で良かったですね
リーファ
401300801_7_a
ま、まあそう言うな
そういうシナリオなんだから、
仕方ないだろ
キリト
401300801_6_a
あわよくば討伐させようとした上……
ホントの目的はあたし達を生贄に
することだったなんて!
401300801_5_a
なんなのよ、
あのミーノス王ってやつ!
自分の息子をこんな所に閉じ込めて、
401300801_4_a
シリカ

リーファ

bg_s2_16_dungeon
あーっ!
ムカつく!
401300801_1_a
そういうことだ……
ミーノス王
401300701_22_a
生贄の数が間違っていると……
あの迷宮区は迷いの呪法が
施されるようになっている……
ミーノス王
401300701_21_a
おぬしらは……
全てを知ってしまったようじゃな……
ミーノス王
401300701_20_a
……!!
ミーノス王
401300701_19_a
プレイヤー達をミノタウロスの生贄に
するために、
あの迷宮を教えたんだ
キリト
401300701_18_a
俺たちに情報を教えたんじゃない
このクエストが神話どおりなら……
キリト
401300701_17_a
俺もそれは覚えてる……
ミーノス王は義理の息子を討伐させる
ために、
キリト
401300701_16_a
どういう意味?
シノのん、勿体ぶらないで教えてよ
アスナ
401300701_15_a
まさにザ・神話のキャラって感じの、
身勝手な性格が災いしたって
ことでしょうね……
シノン
401300701_14_a
そうね……
シノン
401300701_13_a
それもあると思うけど……
正確にはちょっと違うと思います
リーファ
401300701_12_a
討伐するための情報を
こっちに与えてるくらいだからよ
クライン
401300701_11_a
義理とはいえ自分の息子が
牛頭の怪人だなんて知られたく
なかったんじゃねーの?
クライン
401300701_10_a
ミーノスさんはどうしてその事を
隠していたんでしょう?
シリカ
401300701_9_a
神話は案外そういうのが多いからな
キリト
401300701_8_a
牛との間って……
うぇぇ……
なんだかエグイエピソードねぇ……
401300701_7_a
正確には義理のね
ミノタウロスは牛と王妃の間に
生まれた子だから
シノン
401300701_6_a
つまりこの領主さんが
牛の怪人ミノタウロスの
父親ってこと!?

……!

うん、そうだよ
その王様の名前が確か……ミーノス!
リーファ
401300601_39_a
義理の息子であるミノタウロスを
迷宮の中に閉じ込めた……
キリト
401300601_38_a
そいつが次第に乱暴になったことを
みかねた王が、
キリト
401300601_37_a
俺も思い出してきたぞ……
その呪われた妃と白い牛との間に
できた子がミノタウロスで……
キリト
401300601_36_a
ある島国の王様が海神ポセイドンに
不敬を働いて、自分の妃に呪いを
かけられたってやつよね
シノン
401300601_35_a
その伝説って確か……
シノン
401300601_34_a
あのクエストは北欧神話だったので
リーファ
401300601_33_a
あれは多分デザインのモチーフが
ミノタウロスだったってだけ
だと思います
リーファ
401300601_32_a
あのときも言ったけど、
さすがにMobは正座しないだろ……
キリト
401300601_31_a
二体いて……
あの正座させ損ねたやつ!
クライン
401300601_30_a
ミノタウロスっつーと……
スリュムヘイムに行ったときに、
戦ったボスキャラか?
クライン
401300601_29_a
……!
キリト
401300601_28_a
はい、牛の頭と人の身体をした怪人
それは《ミノタウロス》です
リーファ
401300601_27_a
えっ?
あっ……!
シノン
401300601_26_a
で、《牛の怪人》っていうところで、
思い出したギリシャ神話の登場人物が
一人いるんだけど……
リーファ
401300601_25_a
確かに海神ポセイドンは
ギリシャ神話の登場人物……
リーファ
401300601_24_a
漁村を襲ってた魔物がポセイドンの
手先だって聞いたから……
シノン
401300601_23_a
前にシノンさん……このクエストは
ギリシャ神話がモチーフになってる
って言ってましたよね?
リーファ
401300601_22_a
スグ、どうした?
キリト
401300601_21_a
お兄ちゃん……
ちょっと気になってたんだけど
リーファ
401300601_20_a
そうだな……
キリト
401300601_19_a
それを言えれば
新しいヒントをくれるかもですよ!
シリカ
401300601_18_a
で、でも実はアドバイスを
引き出すために
必要なキーワードとかがあって、
シリカ
401300601_17_a
アドバイスが
なんにもねーってわかって、
諦めちまうのも仕方ねー話か……
クライン
401300601_16_a
みんな出ていっちゃったね……
アスナ
401300601_15_a
ああ!

けっ、話にならねー!
もう行こうぜ!
プレイヤー
401300601_13_a
………………
リーファ
401300601_12_a
まあ今回クエストナビがあの人だけ
だから、問い詰めたくなる気持ちは
わかるけどねぇ……
401300601_11_a
NPCにあんな複雑な質問しても、
答えられるわけないのに……
シノン
401300601_10_a
どうすれば
迷宮のギミック解除できるのか、
教えろよ!
プレイヤー
401300601_9_a
けっきょく何度挑戦しても、
怪人の所まで辿りつけなかったもんね

全然進めないぞ、あのダンジョン!
プレイヤー
401300601_1_a

ここはもう少し足並み合わせておこう
キリト

おい、また挑戦するみたいだぜ
クライン
401300501_21_a
おう!
これが最後だ!

401300501_20_a
おい、みんな!
もっかいこっちの道を進んでみるぞ!
プレイヤー
401300501_19_a
う、うーん
そこまでは……
キリト
401300501_18_a
多すぎるって……
じゃあ何人に減らせばいいの?
シノン
401300501_17_a
もしかしたら人数が多すぎるせいで、
進めない仕様になってるのかもな
キリト
401300501_16_a
キリトくん?
アスナ
401300501_15_a
人数……か
キリト
401300501_14_a
これじゃあせっかくレイドクラスの
人数でボス討伐に挑戦できるのに、
無意味だねえ
リーファ
401300501_13_a
でもその解除すべきギミックってのが
現時点だとわからないな……
キリト
401300501_12_a
奥に進むときだけ、なにかしら
ギミックを解除しないと同じ所を
グルグルするのが通例でしょ?
401300501_11_a
大丈夫じゃないかしら
こういうダンジョンって、
戻り道を進むときは問題ないのに
401300501_10_a
帰り道も迷わないか、

人見知りして、

確かにそうだな
まあ今の所は足並み揃えていこうぜ
キリト
401300401_19_a
スコードロン戦も同じよ
実力と信頼関係があってこそ、
初めて人数の多さが戦力となる……
シノン
401300401_18_a
そうだね
突貫レイドでのバトルは
むしろ混乱することもあるからね……
アスナ
401300401_17_a
むしろ足手まといになる可能性
だってあるわ
シノン
401300401_16_a
どうかしら……
ここに集まってるプレイヤーが
全員強いか、わからないわよ
シノン
401300401_15_a
ここにいるプレイヤー全員で
共闘バトルができるんですね!
シリカ

うん、そうだね
このダンジョン、パーティ毎に
分かれて攻略する必要がないんだよ
アスナ

一時的《インスタンス》マップ

リーファ

ちょうど同じタイミングで
ここに集まってきちゃったみたいね

ふーん
だからそんなに詳しいんだね
リーファ
401300301_24_a
我々はそれを見かねて奴を捕え、
洞窟の奥にある牢獄へと
閉じ込めた……
401300301_23_a
あいつは……
以前突如この村に現れ、
暴れ出したのだ
401300301_22_a
あの、その怪人は
昔からそこに住んでるんですか?
アスナ
401300301_21_a
まあそうかもしれないけど……
ちょっと短絡的なような気もするなあ
リーファ
401300301_20_a
牛に変えられたのなら、
きっと牛の頭を持つあいつのせいだ!
401300301_19_a
理由……か?
そんなもの決まっているだろう!
401300301_18_a
半獣ってやつか……
でもどうしてそう思うんだ?
キリト
401300301_17_a
村人が牛の姿に変えられた
というのなら、
恐らくそやつが原因なのだろう……
401300301_16_a
その奥に牛の頭に人の身体を持つ、
異形の怪人が住んでいる
401300301_15_a
この岬を更に北上したところに、
迷宮洞窟と呼ばれる入り組んだ
大空洞がある
401300301_14_a
あいつ?
キリト
401300301_13_a
これは……恐らくあいつのせいだ
401300301_12_a
どうだろうな……
キリト
401300301_11_a
村から少し離れてる場所だから、
呪い的な影響の範囲外
だったんでしょうか?
リーファ
401300301_10_a
確かにそうですね……
リーファ
401300301_9_a
この領主さん……
一応村人NPCの一人っぽいけど、

401300201_21_a
村がちょっと……貧しい感じ
だったから、あの豪勢な見た目は
少し気になってたわ
シノン
401300201_20_a
ああ、そう言えばあったわね
シノン
401300201_19_a
変化とはちょっと違うんだけど、
あの村の外れの岬にさ、
一軒大きめのお屋敷があったよね
リーファ
401300201_18_a
変わったこと……うーん
キリト
401300201_17_a
その……村人が牛になっちまった
以外でよ
クライン
401300201_16_a
なんかその村で変わったこととか
無かったのかよ?
クライン
401300201_15_a
つまり現状、
打つ手なしってことなのね
401300201_14_a
海の魔物も
そこまで強くなかったから……
アスナ
401300201_13_a
確かにこの段階まで進むプレイヤーは
少なくないはずだからね
アスナ
401300201_12_a
他にも同じような状況になって、
困ってるプレイヤーも多いみたいよ
シノン
401300201_11_a
そのNPC達が全員牛に
なってるんじゃ、次になにをすれば
いいかすらわからない
キリト
401300201_10_a
困ってるNPC達から依頼があった
から、魔物討伐をしたのに、
終わらせて戻ってみれば
キリト
401300201_9_a
ああ、クエストが続いてるのは
わかるとして、
その後がノーヒントだからな
キリト
401300201_8_a
なんだよそれ……
奇妙というか気味悪いっつーか……
クライン
401300201_7_a
うん、村人たちと
会話すらできない状態だったからね
アスナ
401300201_6_a
じゃあクエスト報酬もらえてないの?
401300201_5_a
村の人たちがみんな
牛の姿になってたんだよ……
漁師長さんも含めてね……
リーファ
401300201_4_a
401300201_3_a
リーファ
401300201_2_a
bg_event_seashore
そ、それで
村はどうなってたんですか?
シリカ
401300201_1_a
なんだと……!?
キリト
401300101_22_a
た、大変だよ!
まだこのクエスト……
終わってなかったよ!
リーファ
401300101_21_a
ん……なんか慌ててるぞ、スグのやつ
キリト
401300101_20_a
あ、リーファちゃん帰ってきたよ
アスナ
401300101_19_a
お、お兄ちゃん!
みんなー!
リーファ
401300101_18_a
……そうね
これ以上言ってても仕方ないか
もう終わったことだし……
シノン
401300101_17_a
カーディナルの自動生成クエスト
なんだからさ
キリト
401300101_16_a
北欧神話を主軸としつつも、
いろんな神話ネタをネット上から
参照してアレンジするのが、
キリト
401300101_15_a
まあそう言うなって
キリト
401300101_14_a
ポセイドンなんて、
思いっきりギリシャ神話じゃないの
シノン
401300101_13_a
それはそうよ
だってこのALOは
北欧神話をモチーフにしているのよ
シノン
401300101_12_a
あはは……クエスト中も
ずっとそれを言ってたよね、シノのん
アスナ
401300101_11_a
そうカリカリすんなよ、シノン
キリト
401300101_10_a
しかし海の魔物が
海神ポセイドンの手先だなんて……
ヒドい話だわ
シノン
401300101_9_a
はい、そうです
じゃあ行ってきますね
リーファ
401300101_8_a
漁師長さんからもらえるんだよね
アスナ
401300101_7_a
じゃああたし、クエスト主から
報酬もらいに行ってきますねー
リーファ
401300101_6_a
ええ、そうね
孤島の漁村を襲う、海の魔物の
討伐……これで完了したはずよ
シノン
401300101_5_a
これでこのクエストはクリアだね
アスナ
401300101_4_a
シノン
401300101_3_a
アスナ
401300101_2_a
bg_event_seashore
よし!
キリト
401300101_1_a
ええ……槍使いのシノンの力……
見せてあげるわ!!
シノン
401201201_39_a
はい!
シリカ
401201201_38_a
うん!
アスナ
401201201_37_a
近接攻撃の合わせ技を
あのボスにぶつけるんだ!
キリト
401201201_36_a
はは、そうか
よし……じゃあみんな行くぞ
キリト
401201201_35_a
私にも
弓矢や銃以外の遊び方だって……
あるのよ!
シノン
401201201_34_a
遊び方は十人十色
千人プレイヤーがいれば
その分色んなプレイスタイルがある
シノン
401201201_33_a
ふふっ、ふふふっ……
なに言ってるの? 当たり前でしょ?
シノン
401201201_32_a
……!
シノン
401201201_31_a
今……VRMMOを遊んでて
楽しいか?
キリト
401201201_30_a
どうだって、なにが?
シノン
401201201_29_a
シノン……どうだ?
キリト
401201201_28_a
は、はい……!
シリカ
401201201_27_a
それにまさかこんな風に役立つときが
来るとは思わなかったけど……
訓練して良かったって今なら思えるわ
シノン
401201201_26_a
こうして無事にケットシーの
近接限定の新防具を装備できたのは、
シリカのおかげだもの
シノン
401201201_25_a
えっ?
シリカ
401201201_24_a
シリカ、ありがとね
近接武器を勧めてくれて
シノン
401201201_23_a
シノンさん……
シリカ
401201201_22_a
GGOの時のように
自分に打ち勝つために
やってたわけじゃないしね……
シノン
401201201_21_a
別に二度と装備しちゃダメなんて、
ルールを決めたわけじゃないもの
シノン
401201201_20_a
シノのん……いいの?
槍はもう卒業したんじゃ……
アスナ
401201201_19_a
わかったわよ、槍を装備するわ
シノン
401201201_18_a
どう考えてもこの危機的状況は、
近接アタッカーでまとめた方が
得策だものね
シノン
401201201_17_a
えと……あの……
キリト
401201201_16_a
こういう時は槍に持ち替えて
戦ってもらった方がありがたい……
そう言いたいんでしょ?
シノン
401201201_15_a
えっ?
キリト
401201201_14_a
はぁ……
キリトさ、言いたいことがあるなら、
ちゃんと言いなさいよ
シノン
401201201_13_a
シノン……
キリト
401201201_12_a
シノのんは危険だから
下がっててもらえる?
アスナ
401201201_11_a
………………
シノン
401201201_10_a
ああ、みんな最大火力の技で
一斉に攻撃した方がいい
時間をかけるのは得策じゃない……!
キリト
401201201_9_a
そ、そうだね……
牽制してる暇なんてなさそう
アスナ
401201201_8_a
あ、ああ……
だがあのボス相手に、
この戦法は長続きしないな……
キリト
401201201_7_a
キリトさん、大丈夫ですか!?
シリカ
401201201_6_a
くっ……!
キリト
401201201_5_a
アスナ
401201201_4_a
シリカ
401201201_3_a
キリト
401201201_2_a
bg_19_legrue_bridge
ギギャアアアオオオオッ!!!
モンスター
401201201_1_a
い、いや……シノンがいいなら、
それで構わないんだが……
キリト
401201101_26_a
なに?
なにかご不満?
シノン
401201101_25_a
………………
キリト
401201101_24_a
シノン
401201101_23_a
そうなのか……?
キリト
401201101_22_a
明日からはまた
弓に戻ろうかって思ってるのよ
シノン
401201101_21_a
キリトとこうして
近接同士でデュエルできて、
ある程度満足しちゃったし、
シノン
401201101_20_a
言ってたでしょ?
私が槍を扱ってるのは
流行りみたいなもんだって
シノン
401201101_19_a
えっ?
キリト
401201101_18_a
でも……それもそろそろ卒業かしら
シノン
401201101_17_a
冗談じゃないって
キリト
401201101_16_a
ふふっ、そうかしら
冗談でも嬉しいわね
シノン
401201101_15_a
槍使いのプレイヤーの中でも
かなり上位に食い込むと思う
キリト
401201101_14_a
そんなことないぜ
お前の槍術……
突きの速さと精密さは、
キリト
401201101_13_a
あーあ、やっぱり一朝一夕じゃ
あんたに勝つのは無理だったみたいね
シノン
401201101_12_a
ははは、作戦は失敗だったな
キリト
401201101_11_a
花を持たせようとしてるはずだから、
油断してる間に倒しちゃおうと
思ってたのに……
シノン
401201101_10_a
当たり前でしょ
どうせキリトは本気でやるって
言いながらも、どこかで私に
シノン
401201101_9_a
なんだよ、勝つつもりだったのか?
キリト
401201101_8_a
はぁ……
でも結局負ければ意味はないわ
シノン
401201101_7_a
正直甘く見てたよ……
キリト
401201101_6_a
だが正直危なかった……
シノンの槍の扱いがこんなに
上達してたなんて……
キリト
401201101_5_a
………………
シノン
401201101_4_a
ふぅ……
俺の……勝ちみたいだな……
キリト
401201101_3_a
キリト
401201101_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
ぐっ……!
シノン
401201101_1_a
ええっ!
シノン
401201001_20_a
へへっ、よし……!
じゃあやるか!
キリト
401201001_19_a
ふふっ、まあいいわ
今は褒め言葉と受け取っておきましょう
シノン
401201001_18_a
はぁ……女子にその台詞はどうかと
思うけど……
シノン
401201001_17_a
獲物を狩る前のハンターみたいな
鋭い眼差しってやつだよ
キリト
401201001_16_a
そ、そういう目ってどういう目よ!
シノン
401201001_15_a
ふふっ、いいじゃないか
シノンのそういう目を見るのは
久しぶりな気がするぜ
キリト
401201001_14_a
だから今回は、あんたも扱うことに
関してはまだ未知数の……
この得物……そう、槍で勝負をするわ!
シノン
401201001_13_a
本来は剣同士の方が良かったのかも
しれないけど、それじゃあキリトには
とても敵う気がしないしね
シノン
401201001_12_a
確かに剣と弓じゃあ、
そういう戦いはできないかもな
キリト
401201001_11_a
同じ土俵……
なるほど……
キリト
401201001_10_a
同じ土俵だからこそ感じられる戦いの
高揚感をまた味わってみたいのよ……!
シノン
401201001_9_a
それじゃダメよ
私はそう……GGOのBoBで
体感したような……
シノン
401201001_8_a
熟練度だって槍よりも
全然上だろうし……
キリト
401201001_7_a
でも単純に勝敗を決めたいなら、
弓矢の方がシノンは有利じゃないのか?
キリト
401201001_6_a
自分がどれくらい強くなれたのか……
見極めたいのよ
シノン
401201001_5_a
どうもこうもないわ
槍を扱うようになってしばらく経った
から、あんたで実力を試させてほしいの
シノン
401201001_4_a
一戦やる前にどういうことか
聞かせてくれるか?
キリト
401201001_3_a
シノン
401201001_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
さて……
キリト
401201001_1_a
槍を装備して……
あんたにデュエルを挑むわ
シノン
401200901_19_a
えっ?
キリト
401200901_18_a
キリト、私からの挑戦
受けてくれる?
シノン
401200901_17_a
シノン、どうかしたのか?
キリト
401200901_16_a
やっぱあの連撃をいかに
封じるかなんだよなぁ……って
キリト
401200901_15_a
………………
シノン
401200901_14_a
ふふふっ、キリトくん惜しかったね
アスナ
401200901_13_a
はぁ……
今回は勝てそうだったんだけどな
キリト
401200901_12_a
シノン
401200901_11_a
アスナ
401200901_10_a
じゃあボク、スリーピング・ナイツの
みんなのトコに行ってくるよ
またね
ユウキ
401200901_9_a
い、いえ……
シノン
401200901_8_a
二人とも、応援ありがと～!
ユウキ
401200901_7_a
もちろんだよ
アスナ
401200901_6_a
アスナ、シノン
観客席で見ててくれたんだな
キリト
401200901_5_a
キリトくん、ユウキ、お疲れさま
アスナ
401200901_4_a
ふっふっふっ、優勝はいただきだよ!
キリトー!
ユウキ
401200901_3_a
ユウキ
401200901_2_a
bg_event_alo_arena
あ～……やられたやられた……
キリト
401200901_1_a
えっ?
どういうこと?
アスナ
401200801_17_a
私の槍修行……ゴールを見つけたわ
シノン
401200801_16_a
近接武器のプレイヤー同士
だからこそできる、PvPの極致
だと思うけど……
アスナ
401200801_15_a
えっ?
ま、まあ……確かに、つばぜり合い
したり、パリィの応酬ができるのは、
アスナ
401200801_14_a
でもあの勢いのある熾烈な
バトルって、お互いが近接同士
だからこそできるものよね
シノン
401200801_13_a
確かにあの戦いはすごいと思う……
シノン
401200801_12_a
………………
シノン
401200801_11_a
二人の戦いでなにか
気になることでもあった?
アスナ
401200801_10_a
あっ、いえ……
なんでもないの……
シノン
401200801_9_a
シノのん……どうかしたの?
アスナ
401200801_8_a
………………
シノン
401200801_7_a
シノン
401200801_6_a
何度見ても……
あの二人の戦いはすさまじいね
アスナ
401200801_5_a
今度こそ俺も絶対に……勝つ!!
キリト
401200801_4_a
キリト……負けないよ!
ユウキ
401200801_3_a
おおおおおっ!!!
キリト
401200801_2_a
bg_event_alo_arena
はあああっ!!!
ユウキ
401200801_1_a
ふふっ、それは無いから安心して
シノン
401200701_31_a
弓矢引退されちゃったら、
これまでのフォーメーションが
使えなくなっちゃう
アスナ
401200701_30_a
シノのんの遠距離射撃は
わたし達のパーティでも
すごく重要なロールだからね
アスナ
401200701_29_a
うん、
その言葉を聞いて
ちょっと安心しちゃった
アスナ
401200701_28_a
はは、それでいいと思うぜ
キリト
401200701_27_a
とは言えこれも一時的なものよ
まあ私の中で流行ってるとでも
思ってもらえればいいわ
シノン
401200701_26_a
なるほど……そうなんだね
アスナ
401200701_25_a
シノン……
キリト
401200701_24_a
無理に活かそうとせず、
まっさらな気持ちで
学びたいって思うようになったわ
シノン
401200701_23_a
リーチが長い方がいいって
思ってたけど、途中からはガンナーと
しての経験を
シノン
401200701_22_a
ふふっ、まあそうね
最初はできるだけレンジ……
じゃなかった、
シノン
401200701_21_a
えっと……じゃあ極論すると、
違う武器なら、槍じゃなくても
良かったの?
アスナ
401200701_20_a
もっと視野を広げたいって思ったのよ
シノン
401200701_19_a
ガンナーとしての経験値を活かして
こっちでは弓矢を装備したけど、
別にもうこだわる必要はないから……
シノン
401200701_18_a
ええ、元々私はGGOで
自分の弱さに打ち勝つため……
銃を手にしていた
シノン
401200701_17_a
狭めてる……?
キリト
401200701_16_a
一つの武器に固執しすぎるのって、
楽しさを自ら狭めてるような
気もするって……思ったのよ
シノン
401200701_15_a
自由度の高さが売りの
VRMMOにおいて、
シノン
401200701_14_a
それはさすがに無いわよ
ただ最初は新防具を装備する
ためだったけど……
シノン
401200701_13_a
うん、今もその話をしてたんだよ
シノのん、この調子でランサー
としても、極めちゃうんじゃないかって
アスナ
401200701_12_a
おおっ、
相変わらずやり込んでるみたいだな
キリト
401200701_11_a
こんばんは、アスナ
槍限定のクエがあったから、
それをこなしてたのよ
シノン
401200701_10_a
あっ、シノのん
こんばんは、遅かったねー
アスナ
401200701_9_a
ちょっと、二人して、
なに人の噂してるのよ
シノン
401200701_8_a
そうそう
アスナ
401200701_7_a
まあALOにダイブしたてで、
弓矢使い始めたときも
そんな感じだったもんな
キリト
401200701_6_a
一度コツを掴んじゃえば
アッと言う間に、トッププレイヤーの
仲間入りしちゃいそう
アスナ
401200701_5_a
ふふっ、さすがシノのんだね
アスナ
401200701_4_a
ああ、メキメキと上達してるぜ
前回の槍限定大会でも、
ベスト16に食い込んだんだ
キリト
401200701_3_a
キリト
401200701_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
へぇ……
じゃあ最近シノのん、槍を使ってるんだ
アスナ
401200701_1_a
ええ!
シノン
401200601_15_a
そうか、頑張れよシノン
俺も応援してるから!
キリト
401200601_14_a
ただ戦いにも参加できるし、
強い人のアクションも見られて
一石二鳥だって思ったのよ
シノン
401200601_13_a
もちろん槍を扱い始めたばかりで、
簡単に勝ち残れるとは思ってないわ
シノン
401200601_12_a
へぇ……
キリト
401200601_11_a
今日のトーナメントはね、
槍装備限定の大会なのよ
シノン
401200601_10_a
はは……確かに俺たちの中に
槍をメインで扱ってるのはいないからな
キリト
401200601_9_a
仲間内で槍を使える人がいれば、
その人から教えてもらえたんだけどね
シノン
401200601_8_a
実際の操作感は見聞きして
覚えていくしかないからな……
キリト
401200601_7_a
なるほどな
確かに熟練度は反復していれば
自動で上がっていくが……
キリト
401200601_6_a
実力の高いプレイヤーの動きを見て、
参考にしたいって思ったのよ
シノン
401200601_5_a
今は他のプレイヤーがどんなやり方で
槍という武器を扱っているのか
気になってるの
シノン
401200601_4_a
ええ、そうよ
クエストでMobを倒して熟練度を
効率的に上げるのも重要だけど、
シノン
401200601_3_a
シノン
401200601_2_a
bg_event_alo_arena
ここは……
デュエル・トーナメント会場……
キリト
401200601_1_a
………………
シノン
401200501_20_a
えっ……?
なんだそれって……?
キリト
401200501_19_a
それなんだけど……
クエストよりも優先したいことがあるの
シノン
401200501_18_a
そうだよ、きっと!
よーし、じゃあもっとクエストこなして
熟練度をじゃんじゃん上げてこーぜ!
キリト
401200501_17_a
斬撃主体の剣より弱点狙いで
特攻補正の狙える槍の方が……
私向きではあるのかしら
シノン
401200501_16_a
まあ、そうね……
シノン
401200501_15_a
それに比べれば槍で急所狙うくらい、
造作もないってことか……
キリト
401200501_14_a
そうだけど……
シノン
401200501_13_a
そういえばシノンって弓使ってるときも
自動補正の範囲外の標的にも
バンバン当ててたっけ……
キリト
401200501_12_a
どうしたの?
シノン
401200501_11_a
キリト
401200501_10_a
なんというか針の穴をも通す
精密なアクションが
必要というか……
キリト
401200501_9_a
いや、そうは言ってもさ
狙おうとしても、
そう簡単に当たるもんじゃないだろ?
キリト
401200501_8_a
今回のMobってこれまで戦ったことが
あるタイプばかりだったから、
弱点部位は把握してたのよ
シノン
401200501_7_a
最初で今の戦いは上出来だと思うぜ
シノンの突き、ほとんどMobの急所に
当たってただろ?
キリト
401200501_6_a
まだなんとも言えないわね……
確かに剣よりは扱いやすい気がするけど
シノン
401200501_5_a
どうだった、槍の扱いは?
キリト
401200501_4_a
ええ……
シノン
401200501_3_a
シノン
401200501_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
おしっ!
これでクエストクリアだな!
キリト
401200501_1_a
ええ、お願いしてもいい?
シノン
401200401_11_a
なんかクエストに行ってみるか?
なんなら付き合うぜ
キリト
401200401_10_a
そうね……わかったわ
これをちょっと触ってみるわ
シノン
401200401_9_a
これでも短いってことになると、
もう諦めるしかないですぜ、
シノンさん
キリト
401200401_8_a
現状ALOの近接武器で
一番リーチが長いのは槍だからな
キリト
401200401_7_a
ま、まあそうだけど
シノン
401200401_6_a
あはは……
でもまあ急にレア装備渡されて、扱いに
戸惑って壊したりしたくないだろ?
キリト
401200401_5_a
安いやつ……
そこは別に説明しなくても
いいんじゃないの?
シノン
401200401_4_a
ああ、そうだよ
一応ケットシーの女性アバターでも
扱いやすそうな安いやつを持ってきた
キリト
401200401_3_a
キリト
401200401_2_a
item_event_spear
bg_event_alne_field
これは……槍?
シノン
401200401_1_a
……?
シノン
401200301_26_a
別に気にするなって
でも……剣でダメとなると……次は……
キリト
401200301_25_a
今の私……ちょっと勝手すぎたわ
シノン
401200301_24_a
ご、ごめんなさい……
キリト、せっかくこうして
付き合ってもらってるのに
シノン
401200301_23_a
はいはい
もう、わかったよ……
少なくとも剣が向いてないことはな
キリト
401200301_22_a
他の神話ネタもいくつか
持ってきてるでしょ!
シノン
401200301_21_a
いや普通ないってわかるだろ……
北欧神話ベースのALOなんだし……
キリト
401200301_20_a
変な期待持たせないでよ!
シノン
401200301_19_a
いやないだろ
キリト
401200301_18_a
如意棒って……ALOにあるの?
シノン
401200301_17_a
そんなレンジの近接武器なんて、
俺の知る限り西遊記の如意棒くらいしか
ないぞ
キリト
401200301_16_a
GGOで2キロ先から敵を仕留める
スナイパーやってたくらいだから、
その気持ちもわからなくもないけど……
キリト
401200301_15_a
………………
シノン
401200301_14_a
ホントは遠距離武器の射程くらい
欲しいって言いたいんだろ、
シノン?
キリト
401200301_13_a
まあ今レンジって言葉を使った
くらいだから、
キリト
401200301_12_a
そうね……
シノン
401200301_11_a
ケットシーの基本筋力値って
そんなに高くないから、
扱いにくいと思うけど……
キリト
401200301_10_a
でもそれよりもっと刀身が長い剣は
長刀や大剣のカテゴリーになるから、
その分、重量だって重くなるぞ
キリト
401200301_9_a
リーチ……
シノン
401200301_8_a
近接武器の場合はリーチって言った方が
正しいだろうな
キリト
401200301_7_a
レンジが短い……というのも
ちょっとおかしな言い方かしら
シノン
401200301_6_a
けど……?
キリト
401200301_5_a
まあ……楽しさはなんとなく
わかったけど……
シノン
401200301_4_a
どうだ、
一通り教えてみたつもりだけど……?
キリト
401200301_3_a
キリト
401200301_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
ふぅ……
シノン
401200301_1_a
ええ、そんな感じよ
シノン
401200201_18_a
らしいな
じゃあ程々に遊んでみるってとこか?
キリト
401200201_17_a
ただケットシーの新しい防具を
手に入れて、
それを使いこなしてみたいだけ
シノン
401200201_16_a
まあぶっちゃけると今でも興味は
そんなにないわ
シノン
401200201_15_a
しかしシノンが近接武器とはなぁ……
あんまり興味ないのかと思ってたぜ
キリト
401200201_14_a
まあいいわ、
とりあえずキリトの言うように、
やってみる
シノン
401200201_13_a
私……別に弓道を嗜む者じゃ
ないんだけど
シノン
401200201_12_a
武道は礼節や精神の鍛錬も兼ねてるんだ
弓道だって正座しながら瞑想して、
精神統一したりするだろ?
キリト
401200201_11_a
……それって意味があるの?
シノン
401200201_10_a
剣道だって最初は素振りだ
有段者だって稽古の最初は
みんなやってる
キリト
401200201_9_a
まずは素振りだって言ってるだろ?
キリト
401200201_8_a
じゃ、じゃあどうすればいいのよ!
シノン
401200201_7_a
こうやって手取り足取り指導してんだぞ
いきなり師範を斬りつけてくるやつが
あるかよ
キリト
401200201_6_a
おいおい、勘弁してくれよ
俺はシノンが剣を教えて欲しいって
いうから、
キリト
401200201_5_a
キ、キリトがそんなトコに
立ってるからでしょ!?
シノン
401200201_4_a
うおっ、危ない!
キリト
401200201_3_a
キリト
401200201_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
こ、こう!?
シノン
401200201_1_a
シリカがそこまで言うのなら……
ちょっとやってみようかしら……?
シノン
401200101_22_a
物は試しというか、
気楽な気持ちで触ってみる程度でも、
いいんじゃないですか?
シリカ
401200101_21_a
そこまで本格的に考えなくても
いいと思います
シリカ
401200101_20_a
でも私GGOの頃からずっと
ガンナー専門だし、近接武器を装備して
みんなの役に立てるかどうか……
シノン
401200101_19_a
遠距離武器とはだいぶ勝手が
違いますけど……
シリカ
401200101_18_a
近接の立ち回りも楽しいですよ
攻撃と防御と回避を繰り返さなきゃ
なりませんから、
シリカ
401200101_17_a
えっ!?
シノン
401200101_16_a
あっ、そうだ!
この機会にシノンさんも、近接武器を
体験してみたらどうですか!?
シリカ
401200101_15_a
そんなものよねぇ……
シノン
401200101_14_a
ま、まあそうですね……
剣一辺倒って感じでした
シリカ
401200101_13_a
でもメインはあくまで剣でしょ?
タイトルに付いてるくらいだし
シノン
401200101_12_a
SAOだと投擲用のナイフやチャクラム
なんかありましたよ
シリカ
401200101_11_a
ゲーム性を突き詰めると
結局どちらかに偏ってしまうのは
仕方ないことなのかもしれないわね……
シノン
401200101_10_a
まあ逆に言うとGGOは
遠距離武器にほぼ傾倒してるわけで……
シノン
401200101_9_a
遠距離武器って、弓矢かバリスタ……
それくらいですし
シリカ
401200101_8_a
ま、まあ確かにALOの武器は、
近接の方が優遇されてるのは
事実ですよね
シリカ
401200101_7_a
全種類、近接武器装備者の
専用だなんて、
ちょっと酷くないかしら……?
シノン
401200101_6_a
ガッカリもするわよ
せっかくケットシーの新装備の防具が
実装されたっていうのに、
シノン
401200101_5_a
シ、シノンさん
そんなに気を落とさないでください……
シリカ
401200101_4_a
はぁ……
シノン
401200101_3_a
シリカ
401200101_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
………………
シノン
401200101_1_a
ふふっ、じゃあ早速行きましょう
シノン
401101201_19_a
はぁ……まあダメ元で聞くのは
別にいいけどね
401101201_18_a
だよな!
キリト
401101201_17_a
ふふっ、でもお礼を言って気を良くした
アリシャさんならコッソリ教えて
くれるかもですよ!
シリカ
401101201_16_a
そ、そんなことないって!
キリト
401101201_15_a
もしかして飛竜のテイミングの仕方、
教わるの諦めてなかったの……?
401101201_14_a
あら……別にいいけど、
キリトにしては随分律儀ね?
シノン
401101201_13_a
いや、みんなで言いに行こうぜ
せっかくだから今からでもどうだ?
キリト
401101201_12_a
はい、後からお礼を言っておきますね!
シリカ
401101201_11_a
今回はアリシャからのアドバイスも
かなり参考になったわよね
シノン
401101201_10_a
そうか、それは良かったな
キリト
401101201_9_a
このレア素材……武器に防具に
なかなか使い勝手が良さそうだわ
401101201_8_a
まったくよ
でも苦労しただけあるわね
401101201_7_a
そうだな
ほんとあの白竜タイプは
相変わらず一筋縄じゃいかないな……
キリト
401101201_6_a
は、はい
嵐竜のお母さんも倒すことなく
終えられて、良かったです!
シリカ
401101201_5_a
でも良かったじゃない
無事に素材を手に入れられて
シノン
401101201_4_a
キリト
401101201_3_a
シノン

bg_18_mountain_snow
はぁ……今回はさすがに、
死ぬかと思ったわ
401101201_1_a
ギャアアアオオオッ!!!
401101101_25_a
ま、待ってよみんなー!!
401101101_24_a
き、きっとまた怒ったのよ!
リズ、さっさと逃げるわよ!!
シノン
401101101_23_a
わっ、こいつの目の色が変わった!
キリト
401101101_22_a
グギャッ!?
401101101_21_a
やりましたね!
シリカ
401101101_20_a
あっ、あったわ!
これがきっと今回のレア素材よ!
401101101_19_a
卵は狙ってないから……
安心してくださいね……
401101101_18_a
わ、わかってるわよ……
お、お邪魔しますねぇ……
401101101_17_a
リ、リズ……そっとだぞ!
あんまり刺激するんじゃないぞ……!
キリト
401101101_16_a
やったわ……!
い、今のうちなら……
401101101_15_a
こっちの動向を
見定めてるみたいね……!
シノン
401101101_14_a
あ、嵐竜さんの動きが止まりました!
シリカ
401101101_13_a
グ、グルルッ……
401101101_12_a
はぁ、はぁ……ど、どうだ!?
キリト
401101101_11_a
ギリャアアアッ!!!
401101101_10_a
シッ!!
キリト
401101101_9_a
グガッ!?
401101101_8_a
ゼリャアアアッ!!!
キリト
401101101_7_a
ああ、今だ!!
キリト
401101101_6_a
キリト!
嵐竜がひるんだわよ!!

bg_07_xrphan_nest
グゴアアアアアッーーー!
401101101_1_a
隙を見て俺があの卵を狙うモンスターを
攻撃する!
それまでなんとか持ちこたえるんだ!
キリト
401101001_19_a
で、でもそれだと
前とおんなじになっちゃうわよ!
401101001_18_a
くっ……参ったな
逃げても追いつかれるだけだ……!
とりあえず応戦するしかない!
キリト
401101001_17_a
ど、どうしましょう
キリトさん!
シリカ
401101001_16_a
ええっ!?
結局また敵だと思われてるってこと!?
シノン
401101001_15_a
わわっ!
こっちにも威嚇してきてるわよ!!
401101001_14_a
グヤアアアアオッ!!
401101001_13_a
……えっ!?
キリト
401101001_12_a
卵を狙ってるモンスターを倒すんだ
キリト
401101001_11_a
よ、よし!
俺たちに敵意がないことを
示すチャンスだ!
キリト
401101001_10_a
きっとそうですよ!
嵐が止んだのもあのモンスターが
襲ってきたからだと思います!
シリカ
401101001_9_a
もしかしてあれが
卵を狙ってるモンスター!?
シノン
401101001_8_a
見て、あそこ!
嵐竜が別のモンスターと
戦ってるわ!!
401101001_7_a
……!
キリト
401101001_6_a
グロアアアアッ!
401101001_5_a

bg_07_xrphan_nest
ギャオオッ!!
401101001_1_a
ええ!
401100901_15_a
よし、チャンスだ!
嵐竜の巣の付近まで急ぐぞ!
キリト
401100901_14_a
ホントだわ!
まさに無風状態……!
シノン
401100901_13_a
これって風が止んだんじゃない
ですか!?
シリカ
401100901_12_a
きゅいきゅい!
401100901_11_a
ああ……ん?
キリト
401100901_10_a
まずは、
どうにかして気づかれないように
近づく必要があるわけよね……
401100901_9_a
こっちに気づいた時点で、
敵意を剥き出しにしてくるのは
明白だから、
401100901_8_a
そうね、こちらの匂いで気配を察知する
嵐竜に待ち構えられて、
襲われるだけだわ
シノン
401100901_7_a
ひたすら待つしかないと思う……
これ以上近づくと、前の二の舞だからな
キリト
401100901_6_a
そうですね、そもそもこの強風……
止むんでしょうか?
シリカ
401100901_5_a
なかなか嵐が止まないわね……
シノン
401100901_4_a

bg_07_west_mountain_top
………………
キリト
401100901_1_a
ああ、ありがとう
アリシャさん
参考になったよ
キリト
401100801_33_a
なるほど……
けっこうヒントになりそうじゃない?
401100801_32_a
確かにエサとしてあの大きな卵を
食べたがる肉食モンスターなんて
いくらでもいそうね
シノン
401100801_31_a
それって……
卵を狙ってくる別のモンスターがいる
ってことですか?
シリカ
401100801_30_a
恐らくはネ
卵を守る行為に協力すれば、
巣に入るチャンスがあるかもだヨ
アリシャ
401100801_29_a
ってことはそのドラマを利用する……?
キリト
401100801_28_a
生態演出……
シリカ
401100801_27_a
卵を守るっていう生態演出があるからネ
アリシャ
401100801_26_a
想像するに例の嵐竜とやらは、
友好的な態度を取るタイプな気が
するヨ
アリシャ
401100801_25_a
ああ、それは知ってるが……
キリト
401100801_24_a
ヘイト対象としてしか
こちらを見ないタイプがいるんだヨ
アリシャ
401100801_23_a
モンスターはプレイヤーに対して
時折友好的な態度を
取るタイプと、
アリシャ
401100801_22_a
テイミングできるモンスターは
基本的には小動物に限られるケド……
アリシャ
401100801_21_a
ありがとう、アリシャ
シノン
401100801_20_a
別種族は敵対する関係とはいえ、
協力し合うのも時には必要だヨ
アリシャ
401100801_19_a
キリト君たちには日頃から
お世話になってるからね
アリシャ
401100801_18_a
ほ、ホントか!?
キリト
401100801_17_a
でも、飛竜の《ある生態》についてなら
教えてあげてもいいヨ
アリシャ
401100801_16_a
わ、わかってるって!
キリト
401100801_15_a
今回の一番知りたいトコは
そこじゃないのよ?
401100801_14_a
キリトが知りたがりなのはわかるけど、
横道に逸れちゃダメよ
401100801_13_a
あらら、キリト君
そんなに残念だっタ?
でもさすがにそれは言えないヨ
アリシャ
401100801_12_a
や、やっぱり……
キリト
401100801_11_a
それはさすがに企業秘密カナ
竜騎士隊はケットシーの誇る、
最終最強部隊だからネ
アリシャ
401100801_10_a
キミたちの予想どおり、
確かに飛竜をテイミングするには、
特殊な方法が必要なんだケド……
アリシャ
401100801_9_a
そうだネ……
本来テイムできるのは小動物型の
一部モンスターだけだから、
アリシャ
401100801_8_a
あ、ああ
頼めるか……?
キリト
401100801_7_a
飛竜の生態について
教えてほしいんだよネ?
アリシャ
401100801_6_a
ウン、
今ちょうどシリカから話は聞いたヨ
アリシャ
401100801_5_a
お邪魔するわね、アリシャ
早速相談なんだけど……
シノン
401100801_4_a
キリト
401100801_3_a
シノン
401100801_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
やーやー、よく来たネ!
アリシャ
401100801_1_a
SAO時代も
それを求めてテイミング成功に
明け暮れるプレイヤーは多かったぜ
キリト
401100701_21_a
だがその先にあるのが
ビーストテイマーとしての名声だ
キリト
401100701_20_a
基本的なフローはALOも同じはずよ
まったく骨が折れる反復作業よね……
シノン
401100701_19_a
ああ……
キリト
401100701_18_a
ってことは
イベントが発生しなかったら、
ひたすら逃げるしかないのよね?
401100701_17_a
その上で飼いならしイベントの発生を
狙って、何度もエンカウントする
必要があるんだ
キリト
401100701_16_a
同種のモンスターを
ほとんど殺してはならない
キリト
401100701_15_a
ああ、確かSAOでもテイムの制約って
色々あったはずだからな
キリト
401100701_14_a
ふふっ、確かにそうだけど……
それはそれで難易度高そうだわ
シノン
401100701_13_a
いっそのこと飛竜のテイム方法を
教えてもらって、
嵐竜も仲間にしちゃえば楽よねー!
401100701_12_a
ああ、そうすればおのずと、嵐竜の
攻略についてもなにか光明が
見えてくるかもしれない……
キリト
401100701_11_a
竜騎士隊の秘密を知れば、
飛竜の生態についてわかるかも
しれないわね
シノン
401100701_10_a
言われてみれば、これまであんな大きな
タイプのモンスターをテイムしてる
プレイヤーなんて見たことなかったわ
401100701_9_a
テイムが得意なケットシーの戦力
だから、当然テイミングモンスターだと
思ったけど、
401100701_8_a
でも確かに飛竜の生態って
考えてみれば不思議よね……
401100701_7_a
教えてくれるといいわね……
シノン
401100701_6_a
ああ、頼む
キリト
401100701_5_a
はい!
じゃああたしアリシャさんを
呼んできますね!
シリカ
401100701_4_a

bg_18_mountain
……着いたか
キリト
401100701_1_a
き、きっと大丈夫ですよ!
とりあえずケットシー領主の館に
行ってみましょうよ!
シリカ
401100601_28_a
これまでだって隠してきたんだから、
そう簡単には種明かししてくれない
かもしれない……
キリト
401100601_27_a
最終戦力って言うくらいだからな
キリト
401100601_26_a
えっ、なんで教えてくれないと思うの?
アリシャとはもう浅からぬ付き合い
でしょ?
シノン
401100601_25_a
そうだな
ただ教えてくれればの話だが……
キリト
401100601_24_a
話を聞いてみるだけでも、
価値はあるのかもね
シノン
401100601_23_a
確かに飛竜をテイムするなんて、
通常のテイミングの芸当じゃ
なさそう……
シノン
401100601_22_a
ああ、そうらしいな
キリト
401100601_21_a
ケットシーの秘密の最終戦力
だったとか……
401100601_20_a
確か竜騎士隊って例のオベイロン事件の
前までは、存在が秘匿されてきたって
話だったわよね?
401100601_19_a
そ、それは……
ALOの仕様は違うのかも
しれませんが……
シリカ
401100601_18_a
じゃあ竜騎士隊の飛竜達は、
テイムモンスターじゃないってこと?
シノン
401100601_17_a
少なくともSAO準拠の仕様だと
そのはずでした
シリカ
401100601_16_a
テイミングって確か小さなサイズの
モンスターしかできないはずです
シリカ
401100601_15_a
ちょ、ちょっと待ってください!
シリカ
401100601_14_a
同じ飛竜をテイミングしてる
アリシャなら、
生態にも詳しいかもしれないってことね
シノン
401100601_13_a
確かに……!
401100601_12_a
そうだ
ケットシー領主のアリシャさんの
竜騎士隊が乗るのも飛竜なんだ
キリト
401100601_11_a
ケットシーの二人は気づいたみたいだな
キリト
401100601_10_a
なになに!?
二人ともなにか気づいたの?
401100601_9_a
そういえば……!
シリカ
401100601_8_a
あっ……!
シノン
401100601_7_a
飛竜……
別にモンスターの種類の中では
珍しくもないと思うけど
401100601_6_a
飛竜ってことで
ちょっと思い当たることがないか?
キリト
401100601_5_a
そうですけど……
シリカ
401100601_4_a
401100601_3_a
シリカ

bg_18_mountain_snow
白竜ゼーファン、
嵐竜ゼーファン・テンペスト
いずれも飛竜タイプの敵だよな
キリト
401100601_1_a
ああ……
キリト
401100501_21_a
生態……ですか?
シリカ
401100501_20_a
もう少し嵐竜の生態について、
調査した方がいいのかもしれないな
キリト
401100501_19_a
できることなら巣に侵入して、
素材だけを頂戴したいとこだが……
キリト
401100501_18_a
ははは、そうだな
キリト
401100501_17_a
相変わらずあのモンスター、
不憫というか感情移入させるわねぇ……
401100501_16_a
それはそうよね
あの状況を見た上で倒すなんて、
後味悪いわ
シノン
401100501_15_a
えと……多分ですけど、
子供を守ろうとしてる嵐竜のお母さんは
倒したくないってことじゃないかと……
シリカ
401100501_14_a
ピナはなんて言ってるんだ?
キリト
401100501_13_a
きゅいきゅい!
401100501_12_a
やっぱ倒すしかないのかしら……?
401100501_11_a
ですね
卵を守ってるわけですから……
シリカ
401100501_10_a
ああ、だからと言って、
巣から離れるのを待つのも無理だろうな
キリト
401100501_9_a
こうして逃げ帰るだけで、精一杯よ……
シノン
401100501_8_a
この人数だと
ちょっと討伐は無理そうね……
シノン
401100501_7_a
子を守る母は、
やっぱり強いってこと
なんですかね……?
シリカ
401100501_6_a
一時はどうなることかと思ったわ……
なんなのよ、あの強さ……
401100501_5_a
な、なんとかね……
シノン
401100501_4_a
401100501_3_a
シノン

bg_07_west_mountain_top
はぁ、はぁ……
みんな生きてるか?
キリト
401100501_1_a
くっ、仕方ない!
応戦するぞ!
キリト
401100401_28_a
わあっ、こっちに飛んできましたよ!
シリカ
401100401_27_a
グオオオオオアアアッ!!!
401100401_26_a
自分の子供を守ってるのか……
キリト
401100401_25_a
孵化させるために温めてるってこと?
401100401_24_a
大きな卵ね……
ってことは、あの嵐竜の子供……?
シノン
401100401_23_a
……!
あれは……卵!?
キリト
401100401_22_a
あっ!
見てください!
あの嵐竜の足元!!
シリカ
401100401_21_a
いえ、でも今みたいな鳴き声って……
確か他の小竜が近くにいる時とかに
使ってたような……
シリカ
401100401_20_a
いやさすがにそれはないんじゃ……
401100401_19_a
まさか嵐竜を仲間だと思ってる?
キリト
401100401_18_a
きゅきゅる!
401100401_17_a
ピナ、どうしたの?
シリカ
401100401_16_a
きゅいきゅいー!
401100401_15_a
ホントですね……
まるで自分を盾にして
なにかを守るみたいに……
シリカ
401100401_14_a
ね、ねえあいつなんか変じゃない?
こっちを威嚇してるわりに、
全然襲いかかってこないわよ
401100401_13_a
……?
シノン
401100401_12_a
グルギャアッ!
グロゴオオオアッ!!
401100401_11_a
天候の変化が
そんな影響も与えてたのか……
キリト
401100401_10_a
恐らくこの風の影響ですよ!
風に乗ってあたし達の匂いを
嗅ぎつけたんだと思います!
シリカ
401100401_9_a
気づかれなきゃ
まだ救いはあったんだろうけど……
401100401_8_a
しかも思いっきり
こっちを見てるわね……
401100401_7_a
あいつが嵐竜ね……
ばっちり巣の前に
陣取ってるじゃないの!
シノン
401100401_6_a
くっ、やっぱダメだったか!
キリト
401100401_5_a
401100401_4_a
シノン
401100401_3_a
キリト
401100401_2_a
bg_07_west_mountain_top
グルアアアアッ……!
401100401_1_a
はい、そうですね!
シリカ
401100301_19_a
そうなのね……
わかったわ、
まずはその戦法で狙ってみましょう
シノン
401100301_18_a
当時はその攻略法が
発見されてなかったからね
401100301_17_a
はは、そういえばそうね
巣から鉱物奪えばそれで済むのに、
401100301_16_a
なんか可哀想で……
キリト
401100301_15_a
あいつ……
SAOのときも報酬目当てに、
乱獲されまくってたからな
キリト
401100301_14_a
うーん、
まあ興味がないわけじゃないけど、
キリト
401100301_13_a
戦って討伐する気はないの?
シノン
401100301_12_a
なるほど……常套手段ね
バトルも避けられるし、
効率的ではあるけど……
401100301_11_a
もしくは誰かで巣からおびき出して、
その時を狙って素材だけを奪うとかな
キリト
401100301_10_a
嵐竜が留守のときを
狙うってことですか?
シリカ
401100301_9_a
それとおんなじ事が
できないかって
考えてただけだよ
キリト
401100301_8_a
そうね
401100301_7_a
奴がいないタイミングに
忍び込んで巣で奪っただろ?
キリト
401100301_6_a
前にアインクラッドで白竜の素材を
取りに行ったときは、
キリト
401100301_5_a
まあ作戦ってほどでもないんだが……
キリト
401100301_4_a
401100301_3_a
キリト
401100301_2_a
bg_07_snow_mountain
で、どんな作戦を考えてたの、
キリト?
シノン
401100301_1_a
はいはい……わかったよ
キリト
401100201_24_a
あはは、おなじく……です
シリカ
401100201_23_a
まあそれは同意ね……
シノン
401100201_22_a
だからもう全部任せるの!
あんたを信頼してるってことで
いいじゃない!
401100201_21_a
だって考えたって、
どうせいつもキリトが正解導いて、
最後にイイとこ持っていくわけでしょ?
401100201_20_a
い、いや……考えてはいるが……
というかリズ達もなにか考えてくれよ!
俺にまかせっきりにしないでさぁ
キリト
401100201_19_a
まさかなにも考えてないの?
強敵だってわかってるのに、
この人数で正面切って挑むつもり!?
401100201_18_a
ああ、それか……
キリト
401100201_17_a
アンタ自分で言ってたでしょ?
対抗策が必要だって!
401100201_16_a
作戦?
キリト
401100201_15_a
さて、じゃあバトル好きで
頭脳派のキリトさんに、そろそろ
作戦を語ってもらおうじゃないの
401100201_14_a
ううっ、二人とも大変そうなのに、
なんでそんなに楽しげなんですかー?
シリカ
401100201_13_a
ふふっ、確かに
そう考えられなくもないわね
シノン
401100201_12_a
でも今回の奴も気候を変化させる
くらいの影響力があるってことは、
同じくらい強いってことなのかもな……
キリト
401100201_11_a
あはは……霜の巨人ですね
あれは大変でしたね
シリカ
401100201_10_a
気候に影響を与えるモンスターか……
なんだか最近そういうの多いわね
シノン
401100201_9_a
そうかもね……
SAOでもあいつ氷山地帯に
住んでたわね……
401100201_8_a
ってことは……
この強風は、例の嵐竜の影響なのか?
キリト
401100201_7_a
でも普段はここまで寒くないわよ
この辺はうちのエリアの中でも
まだあったかい方だったはず……
401100201_6_a
レプラコーン領は大陸の中でも
北方にあるので、
元々こんな気候なんですよね……
シリカ
401100201_5_a
確かに風が強いわね……
シノン
401100201_4_a
シノン
401100201_3_a

bg_07_snow_mountain
ううっ……
なかなか前に進めないわ……
それに寒い……
401100201_1_a
シノン、シリカ
助かる、頼むぜ
キリト
401100101_28_a
あ、あたしもお手伝いしますよ!
シリカ
401100101_27_a
面白そうね、私も付き合うわ
シノン
401100101_26_a
よし……じゃあ挑戦してみるか
キリト
401100101_25_a
まあね
あたしもレア鉱物は手に入れたいし!
401100101_24_a
リズの方こそやる気満々じゃないか
キリト
401100101_23_a
ふふっ、
あんたならそう言ってくれる
って思ったわ!
401100101_22_a
あの強さのモンスターとやり合うには、
色々と対抗策が必要だろうが……
手に入る素材もきっと貴重だろうしな
キリト
401100101_21_a
まあ……なくはないな
キリト
401100101_20_a
キリト、どう?
興味が湧かない?
401100101_19_a
カーディナルの自動生成機能だろうな
SAOのMobデータを
再利用したんだろう
キリト
401100101_18_a
正式名は
《嵐竜ゼーファン・テンペスト》
っていうらしいわ
401100101_17_a
正確にはその派生版みたいな
やつみたい……
401100101_16_a
へぇ……ってことは討伐はしてないのね
その白竜がこのALOに?
シノン
401100101_15_a
ああ、そいつのウン……
いや、その……そいつの巣から
手に入れたんだよ、うん……
キリト
401100101_14_a
確か、リズさんとキリトさんで
その素材を取りに行った
んですよね
シリカ
401100101_13_a
討伐することよりもむしろ、
その素材の価値が高いことで
話題になったモンスターだったんだ
キリト
401100101_12_a
フロアボスよりも強力に
設定されてたんだが……
キリト
401100101_11_a
階層攻略とは別に用意されたボスで、
サブクエスト的な扱いのせいか、
キリト
401100101_10_a
ああ、そいつはSAOに登場した
モンスターだ
キリト
401100101_9_a
白竜ゼーファン……?
そんなモンスター聞いたことないわ
シノン
401100101_8_a
それが白竜ゼーファンにそっくりなの!
401100101_7_a
レプラコーン領に
新しい竜型のモンスターが
現れたんだけど……!
401100101_6_a
リズさん、どうしたんですか?
シリカ
401100101_5_a
リズ?
キリト
401100101_4_a
シリカ

バイバイ、ジーマ
アスナ
401001201_28_a
キリト
401001201_27_a
じゃあね、二人とも
ジーマ
401001201_26_a
うん、待ってるね!
アスナ
401001201_25_a
すごいの釣り上げて
アスナに料理してもらいに来るよ
ジーマ
401001201_24_a
そうだね、うん……
きっと会えると思う
ジーマ
401001201_23_a
また会えるよな
キリト
401001201_22_a
……よし!
じゃあ行くよ、二人とも末永くお幸せに
ジーマ
401001201_21_a
そうか
キリト
401001201_20_a
父さんもきっと……
そこを見抜いてたんだと思う
ジーマ
401001201_19_a
スキルだけじゃない……
人間としての器みたいなものかな
ジーマ
401001201_18_a
ジーマはまだまだ釣りスキルを
上げるつもりなんだね
アスナ
401001201_17_a
だからこれからは正々堂々と
釣り師同士で戦い合えるように、
もっと実力をつけるつもりだよ
ジーマ
401001201_16_a
それを横取りなんてしたくないって
思ったんだ
ジーマ
401001201_15_a
でもヌシについてはニシダさん達が
元々狙ってた獲物だからね
ジーマ
401001201_14_a
はは……それもそうか
キリト
401001201_13_a
あはは、自分で言うのソレ?
ジーマ
401001201_12_a
いや別にズルなんてしてないだろ
俺が……途中で見破っちゃったし
キリト
401001201_11_a
いやいや、そうはいかないよ
アタシは……ヌシを釣るためとはいえ、
ちょっとズルをしようとしたんだから
ジーマ
401001201_10_a
数日もすれば
ホンモノのヌシ釣りがあるはずだぞ
一緒に参加すればいいじゃないか
キリト
401001201_9_a
えっ……?
アスナ
401001201_8_a
さて、アタシはそろそろお暇するかな
ジーマ
401001201_7_a
ジーマ……
キリト
401001201_6_a
こんな美味い魚料理は
本当に久しぶりだ……
ジーマ

ふふっ、お粗末さまでした

ジーマ……
アスナ

………………
ジーマ
401001101_11_a
そ、そうですか……わかりました
キリト
401001101_10_a
ええ、そうですね
釣りを行う日取りは今調整しています
決まり次第またお家までお伺いしますよ
ニシダ
401001101_9_a
じゃあヌシはまだ別にいるんだね
アスナ
401001101_8_a
ヌシじゃなかったんだ……
ジーマ
401001101_7_a
これは私が見たものとは異なります
釣り仲間に確認しても、
同じことを言うと思いますよ
ニシダ
401001101_6_a
魚影や遠くで湖の水面を飛び跳ねるのを
見かけたことがありますが……
ニシダ
401001101_5_a
えっ……そうなんですか?
キリト
401001101_4_a
ジーマ
401001101_3_a
キリト

bg_13_coral_lake
これは……ヌシではありませんな
ニシダ
401001101_1_a
それでも構わないよ!
さあ、やろう!
ジーマ
401001001_14_a
俺達はいいけど
一応ニシダさんには確認したいな
キリト
401001001_13_a
ええっ!?
二人ともこんな時に何言ってるの!?
アスナ
401001001_12_a
ははは、意地悪だねぇ
うーん、
戦った後で考えよう、じゃダメかな?
ジーマ
401001001_11_a
ジーマ、分け前はどうするんだ?
キリト
401001001_10_a
よし、戦おう!
アスナ
401001001_9_a
そうだな
少なくとも釣ってどうにかなる相手じゃ
なさそうだ
キリト
401001001_8_a
モンスター……
つまり倒さなきゃダメってことだね……
アスナ
401001001_7_a
口元の糸……
あれがさっきアタシが釣ろうとしてた
相手なのは間違いないみたいだね
ジーマ
401001001_6_a
あれは……ヌシなのか……
いや、魚型のモンスター……?
キリト
401001001_5_a
グルルルッ……!
???

bg_event_limestone_cave
あ、あそこに何かいる……!?
ジーマ
401001001_1_a
なるほど……
アスナ
401000901_26_a
ああ、そうだよ
ジーマ
401000901_25_a
俺達のことさっきまではニシダさんの
釣り仲間だと思ってたからだろ?
キリト
401000901_24_a
別にこじれないと思うけど……
アスナ
401000901_23_a
ただホントのことを言うとこじれると
思ったから、ヌシを釣るまで
黙っていたかった……これが真相さ
ジーマ
401000901_22_a
ははは、
さすがにそんなコソドロみたいなことは
考えてなかったよ
ジーマ
401000901_21_a
ヌシを釣り上げた後で
素材を奪うつもりだったとか?
キリト
401000901_20_a
俺が気づかなかったら
どうするつもりだったんだ?
キリト
401000901_19_a
アインクラッドのあらゆる魚を
一人で釣り上げたんだぞってね……
ジーマ
401000901_18_a
ただね……アタシは言いたかったんだ
父さんにゲームの中でも釣りを
極めたぞって
ジーマ
401000901_17_a
いやならないよ
なるわけないでしょ、
ゲームの中の話なんだし
ジーマ
401000901_16_a
一人でヌシを釣ることが
何かの証明になるのか?
キリト
401000901_15_a
だから認めてもらえるか
わからないけど……
ジーマ
401000901_14_a
まあ高卒の時点でそうしようとしたら、
父さんに大反対されて大学に行ったんだ
ジーマ
401000901_13_a
現実で漁師の娘なんだ
今、大学生なんだけど卒業したら、
父親の手伝いをするつもりでいる
ジーマ
401000901_12_a
アタシね……
出会ったばかりのアンタ達に言うのは
少し気が引けるんだけど……
ジーマ
401000901_11_a
漁……?
キリト
401000901_10_a
漁はね……
他の漁師と協力し合いながらも、
やっぱり競い合う世界なんだよ
ジーマ
401000901_9_a
それなら普通に言えばいいのに……
アスナ
401000901_8_a
………………
キリト
401000901_7_a
絶対に一人で釣ってみせるって……
決めてね
ジーマ
401000901_6_a
だからアタシは準備をして
ヌシ釣りに挑んだんだよ
ジーマ
401000901_5_a
ついでに言うとこの洞窟の存在も、
ヌシ関連の情報の中で噂されていた
ジーマ
401000901_4_a
アスナ
401000901_3_a
キリト
401000901_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
この湖のヌシは釣り師界隈でも
かなり有名な獲物だったんだ
ジーマ
401000901_1_a
もう少し先にいこう
歩きながら説明するよ
ジーマ
401000801_22_a
ジーマさん……
アスナ
401000801_21_a
なるほどねぇ……
さすがは上位プレイヤー様だね
誤魔化せないか……
ジーマ
401000801_20_a
こいつは何かにこだわっている
そう思って、俺も放さなかったんだ
キリト
401000801_19_a
……!
ジーマ
401000801_18_a
普通はどう考えても危険だから
手を放すだろ?
キリト
401000801_17_a
一番最初に感じたのは
アンタが湖に引き込まれそうに
なってるのに、手を放さなかったことだ
キリト
401000801_16_a
……!
アスナ
401000801_15_a
……最初から疑ってたの?
ジーマ
401000801_14_a
じ、ジーマさん……そうなんですか?
アスナ
401000801_13_a
………………
ジーマ
401000801_12_a
だから戻ってきたんだろう?
俺達とパーティを組んで攻略する方に
切り替えたんだ
キリト
401000801_11_a
だがこの洞窟のダンジョンは
予想外に大きく、また敵Mobも
強力だった
キリト
401000801_10_a
なっ……!
ジーマ
401000801_9_a
最初から離れるつもりだったんじゃ
なかったのか?
キリト
401000801_8_a
最初俺達が寝てるときに、
周囲を見に行ってきたって
言ってたのは、
キリト
401000801_7_a
そ、そうだよキリトくん
ソロで旅を続けてる人なら、それくらい
持ち歩いてても不思議じゃないよ
アスナ
401000801_6_a
はは……
考えすぎだよ
ジーマ
401000801_5_a
そしてこの洞窟のことを、
知っていたからじゃないのか?
キリト
401000801_4_a
アスナ
401000801_3_a
ジーマ
401000801_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
さっき言ってたストレージの中身の準備
それは最初からヌシのこと、
キリト
401000801_1_a
キリトくん……何を言ってるの?
アスナ
401000701_20_a
……!
ジーマ
401000701_19_a
どうしてヌシのことを
知ってたのに黙っているのか……
教えてくれ
キリト
401000701_18_a
……はっ?
何のこと?
ジーマ
401000701_17_a
ジーマが秘密にしてること、教えてくれ
キリト
401000701_16_a
えっ……?
ジーマ
401000701_15_a
ジーマが俺達のことを
なんとなく気づいていたのなら、
ついでに質問だ
キリト
401000701_14_a
だとしたら無意識にってやつ?
それはそれですごいけどね
二人は……戦いに身を置く者なんだね
ジーマ
401000701_13_a
そうだよ、わたし達普段は、
けっこう気を抜いてるよねー
アスナ
401000701_12_a
はは、そんな大したもんじゃないさ
キリト
401000701_11_a
笑ってるときも仲良く話してるときも、
常に気を抜いていないというか、
周囲に気を配っているというか……
ジーマ
401000701_10_a
よく見るとぜんぜん隙がないんだよね
ジーマ
401000701_9_a
……パッと見て二人って、
のほほんとしたカップルに
思えるんだけどさ
ジーマ
401000701_8_a
アンタ達二人の尋常じゃない
強さの秘密がね
ジーマ
401000701_7_a
なるほどねー
それでようやく合点がいったよ
ジーマ
401000701_6_a
な、なるほど……
フフッ、あははは!
ジーマ
401000701_5_a
ああ、そうだ
キリト
401000701_4_a
アスナ
401000701_3_a
キリト
401000701_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
こ、攻略組の……
黒の剣士と血盟騎士団副団長……!
ジーマ
401000701_1_a
う、うん……わかったよ
ジーマ
401000601_23_a
俺達のことは教えるけど、
ニシダさんには黙っておいてくれよ
キリト
401000601_22_a
……?
ジーマ
401000601_21_a
ま、まあ言っても問題はないか……
キリト
401000601_20_a
……どうする?
アスナ
401000601_19_a
……………
キリト
401000601_18_a
ねえ、二人とも本当に、
湖の近くに住むただの
村人プレイヤーなの?
ジーマ
401000601_17_a
アンタ達が強すぎるって意味だよ
ジーマ
401000601_16_a
ど、どういう意味?
アスナ
401000601_15_a
さっきからアンタ達二人を見てると、
ちょっと自信が無くなってくるの
ジーマ
401000601_14_a
アタシも自分はそれなりに
強いプレイヤーだと思ってたけどさ
ジーマ
401000601_13_a
な、なんだよ
こっちをジロジロ見て……
キリト
401000601_12_a
バトルねぇ……
ジーマ
401000601_11_a
そうだね
アスナ
401000601_10_a
バトルの準備もしておくか
キリト
401000601_9_a
つまりまだピンピンしてるってことだね
ジーマ
401000601_8_a
だと思うよ
しかも奴は自力でこの針を
取ったように見えるね……
ジーマ
401000601_7_a
それがここにあるってことは……
ジーマさんが釣ろうとしていた獲物が
この近くにいる……?
アスナ
401000601_6_a
ああ、そうだよ
途中で噛み千切られてるけどね
ジーマ
401000601_5_a
item_13_fishing_rod
そこに落ちてるの……
ジーマの釣り竿か?
キリト
401000601_4_a
アスナ
401000601_3_a
キリト
401000601_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
むっ……これを見て
ジーマ
401000601_1_a
アスナ
401000501_16_a
よし、こっちはまだ行ってないはず……
行ってみよう
ジーマ
401000501_15_a
………………
キリト
401000501_14_a
ソロプレイが続くと
こういうのは常備しておくに限るってね
あはは……
ジーマ
401000501_13_a
わぁ、ジーマさん
すごいですね
アスナ
401000501_12_a
数日ここにいたって、
生活には困らないよ
ジーマ
401000501_11_a
食料やテント、火を起こすための
準備なんかも、ちゃんとストレージに
入れてあるから
ジーマ
401000501_10_a
でも安心して
ジーマ
401000501_9_a
そうだったのか……
キリト
401000501_8_a
あまりにも広すぎたから
調査は途中で切り上げて、
二人の所に戻ってきちゃったんだよ
ジーマ
401000501_7_a
ああ、ごめん
結局わからなかったんだ
ジーマ
401000501_6_a
ねえ、ジーマさん
この洞窟がどれくらいの広さか、
わかったの?
アスナ
401000501_5_a
そうだね……
アスナ
401000501_4_a
ジーマ
401000501_3_a
アスナ
401000501_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
この洞窟……結構大きいんだな
キリト
401000501_1_a
う、うーん……
ヌシ釣りはニシダさんと後日やる
予定だし……どうしよう……
キリト
401000401_20_a
……ど、どうする?
キリトくん?
アスナ
401000401_19_a
出たければいつでも出られるでしょ?
せっかくならそいつを
捕まえてからにしようよ
ジーマ
401000401_18_a
ええっ……?
ここから出るんじゃないのか?
キリト
401000401_17_a
ふぅん……面白そう
そいつはアタシが釣ってみせる!
ジーマ
401000401_16_a
ああ、ニシダさんの話によると
この湖にそういう《魚のボス》
みたいなのが、棲みついてるらしいぜ
キリト
401000401_15_a
……ヌシなんてのがいるの?
ジーマ
401000401_14_a
もしかして……例の湖のヌシ?
アスナ
401000401_13_a
とりあえず周囲の様子を見てきたけど、
どうやらここはアタシ達が
釣ろうとした奴の巣みたいだよ
ジーマ
401000401_12_a
へへっ、アタシを甘く見ない方がいいよ
って……強がり言ってるときじゃないか
ジーマ
401000401_11_a
ジーマも無事だったのか?
キリト
401000401_10_a
やあ、二人とも
気づいたみたいね
ジーマ
401000401_9_a
うん、HPも減らないね
アスナ
401000401_8_a
な、なるほど……
洞窟……か
だから一応空気もあるのか
キリト
401000401_7_a
わたしも今気づいたところだけど、
どうやらここ……
湖の底にある洞窟みたいだね
アスナ
401000401_6_a
ジーマさんの釣ろうとしてた魚に
逆に引っ張られて湖の中に
引き込まれちゃったんだよ
アスナ
401000401_5_a
アスナ……俺達は一体……?
キリト
401000401_4_a
キリトくん……
アスナ
401000401_3_a
アスナ
401000401_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
ん……
キリト
401000401_1_a
えらいことに……
一体ど、どうすれば……?
ニシダ
401000301_42_a
ななっ……!
3人とも湖の中に
引き込まれてしまった……!
ニシダ
401000301_41_a
きゃあああっ!!
アスナ
401000301_40_a
わあああっ!!
キリト
401000301_39_a
わああああっ～～～!!!
ジーマ
401000301_38_a
アスナ
401000301_37_a
キリト
401000301_36_a
ぐっ、ぬっ、
ジーマ
401000301_35_a
わ、私はどうすれば……
ニシダ
401000301_34_a
キリト
401000301_33_a
ジーマ
401000301_32_a
じゃあわたしはキリトくんの腰に
手を回すね……!
アスナ
401000301_31_a
は、ハイ!
キリト
401000301_30_a
いいからさっさとして～!!
ジーマ
401000301_29_a
それだとハラスメント・コードが……
キリト
401000301_28_a
なに恥ずかしがってるの!?
さっさとアタシの腰に手を回して!
ジーマ
401000301_27_a
ええと……
手伝ってと言われてもどうすれば……
キリト
401000301_26_a
相当な獲物がかかったようですな!
ニシダ
401000301_25_a
は、はい!
アスナ
401000301_24_a
くっ……アタシも結構
筋力は鍛えてるはずなのに……
くううっ……みんな、助けて!
ジーマ
401000301_23_a
おっ、大物か?
キリト
401000301_22_a
なんだこいつ……
超重いんですけどぉ……!
ジーマ
401000301_21_a
では早速……ん?
ジーマ
401000301_20_a
あっ、ホントだね
ジーマ
401000301_19_a
おっ、また糸を引いてるぞ
キリト
401000301_18_a
そっか、ありがとう
ジーマ
401000301_17_a
いやいや、
別に独占するつもりはありませんぞ
心行くまで楽しんでいってください
ニシダ
401000301_16_a
もう少し楽しんだら帰るから
もうちょっと遊ばせてよ
ジーマ
401000301_15_a
悪いね、ニシダさん
ここは元々
あなたの場所だったんでしょ?
ジーマ
401000301_14_a
ニシダさんと同じくらいだ
すごいな……
キリト
401000301_13_a
ほほぅ……これは大したもんですな
ニシダ
401000301_12_a
結構高いと思うよ、ホラ、こんな感じ
ジーマ
401000301_11_a
ジーマさんは釣りスキルが
どれくらいなんですか?
アスナ
401000301_10_a
ちょうど穴場っぽいのを見つけたんだよ
ちょうど小一時間前にね
ジーマ
401000301_9_a
この湖が釣りのメッカだって聞いて、
散策してたら
ジーマ
401000301_8_a
色々なギルドやパーティに一時的に
参加して、釣りが楽しめる場所を
探して渡り歩いてるんだ
ジーマ
401000301_7_a
いや、違うよ
アタシは基本ソロだけど
やっぱり独り歩きは危険だし、
ジーマ
401000301_6_a
い、いやそうじゃなくて、
釣りで遊ぶときに
よくここに来るのかって意味で……
キリト
401000301_5_a
ずっとって……どういう意味?
デスゲーム化してからずっとって意味?
ジーマ
401000301_4_a
アスナ
401000301_3_a
ジーマ
401000301_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
ジーマはずっとここで
釣りをしてるのか?
キリト
401000301_1_a
ははは……こういう出会いも
釣りの醍醐味の一つですな
ニシダ
401000201_27_a
……どうします、ニシダさん?
キリト
401000201_26_a
アタシはジーマ
ほら、ここに座んなよ
一緒に釣ろうよ
???
401000201_25_a
なーんて現実だとそう言うんだけど、
この世界でそこまでツンケンする
必要もないかぁ
???
401000201_24_a
むむっ……!
ニシダ
401000201_23_a
他を当たってくれない?
???
401000201_22_a
ん……なあに、アンタ達
ここはアタシが先に見つけた穴場なの
???
401000201_21_a
あれっ……誰かいる?
先客みたいだよ
アスナ
401000201_20_a
おっ……見えてきましたぞ
そこが今回の釣り場です
ニシダ
401000201_19_a
ははは、ですね
キリト
401000201_18_a
このデスゲームで
そんなことを言っている余裕は
ありませんが
ニシダ
401000201_17_a
それもまた……
仮想世界の楽しさの一つですかな
ニシダ
401000201_16_a
はい、そんな感じですね
キリト
401000201_15_a
な、なるほど……
ステータスの限界以上の行為をした
ことへの代償という感じですかな
ニシダ
401000201_14_a
自分が疲れていると思い込んでるんだと
思いますよ
キリト
401000201_13_a
俺達に歩調を合わせてしまったせいで
普段よりも早く歩いたことが
脳にも伝わり、
キリト
401000201_12_a
イメージ……ですか?
ニシダ
401000201_11_a
ニシダさんのイメージが
そうさせているんじゃないかと
キリト
401000201_10_a
しかし……疲れるはずのない
VRMMOで、こんなに息が切れる
というのも、難儀なものですなぁ……
ニシダ
401000201_9_a
そ、そうなんです
アスナ
401000201_8_a
はは……結構こういうのは慣れてるんで
キリト
401000201_7_a
だ、大丈夫ですぞ……
し、しかし、いやはや……
お二人ともさすがにお若い……
ニシダ
401000201_6_a
辛そうですけど……
アスナ
401000201_5_a
に、ニシダさん……大丈夫ですか?
キリト
401000201_4_a
アスナ
401000201_3_a
キリト
401000201_2_a
bg_11_road_to_coral
ぜーっ、はーっ……
ニシダ
401000201_1_a
はい、きっと平気だと思います!
アスナ
401000101_17_a
奥さんも?
ニシダ
401000101_16_a
あっ、はい
たぶん大丈夫だと……
キリト
401000101_15_a
森の獣道を抜けていきます
ちょっと険しいところを通りますが、
お二人大丈夫ですかな?
ニシダ
401000101_14_a
その場所にはどうやって行くんですか?
キリト
401000101_13_a
はは、そうとも言えますな
ニシダ
401000101_12_a
ヌシ釣り前の事前練習って
感じですね?
アスナ
401000101_11_a
なにせキリトさんには
湖のヌシを釣っていただけると
約束していただけたのですから
ニシダ
401000101_10_a
ええ、もちろん構いませんとも
ニシダ
401000101_9_a
まだ俺達、ニシダさんと
出会ったばかりで、
そんな場所を教えてもらっちゃって……
キリト
401000101_8_a
でも……いいんですか?
キリト
401000101_7_a
小型の淡水魚から肉厚の大物まで、
バンバン獲れるので期待しててください
ニシダ
401000101_6_a
ええ、
私しか知らない絶好のスポットですぞ
ニシダ
401000101_5_a
ニシダさん、
お迎えありがとうございます
今日は釣りの穴場に行くんですよね?
アスナ
401000101_4_a
アスナ
401000101_3_a
ニシダさん、おはようございます
キリト
401000101_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
おはようございます、ご両人
ニシダ
401000101_1_a
ああ、そうだな
キリト
400901201_29_a
ええ、そうね
これからもこのシリーズの続編を
期待したいところだわ
シノン
400901201_28_a
やっぱ神話をモチーフにしてる
ALOだからこそ、神話ネタで
クエストを作ってくれると楽しいよ
リーファ
400901201_27_a
そーだね
でもそれはそれで面白そう!
リーファ
400901201_26_a
これからも関連したクエが
発生することもあるのかもしれないな
キリト
400901201_25_a
ああ……
でもこの黄金林檎や霜の巨人について、
わかっていないことは多い
キリト
400901201_24_a
そうね
一時はどうなることかと思ったけど、
これで一件落着ってことね……
400901201_23_a
でもいずれにせよ黄金林檎は無事に
見つかり、弱体化した巨人たちも
一掃できたってわけだネ
アリシャ
400901201_22_a
あはは、
まあ確かに最後はドタバタだったよね
ユウキ
400901201_21_a
ははは
キリト
400901201_20_a
まぁ、あの切迫した状況でやれることが
それくらいしか思いつかなかった
わけだけどな
キリト
400901201_19_a
確かに回復アイテムって扱いでは
あるけど……
よくそこまで考えが至ったわね……
シノン
400901201_18_a
同じ世界樹に使用することで、
成長を促進させられるんじゃないか
ってな
キリト
400901201_17_a
そこで更に考えた
元々プレイヤーを蘇生させる
世界樹の雫だが、
キリト
400901201_16_a
そもそも地上から見えない地中に
沈んでるんじゃないかって思ったんだ
キリト
400901201_15_a
場所が違うんじゃなくて、
長年砂や土が堆積して埋もれていき、
キリト
400901201_14_a
若木が植えられたのが大昔だって
聞いただろ?
だからきっとこれは、枯れたとか
キリト
400901201_13_a
あはは
でもキリト、あの時どうやって、
世界樹の若木を出現させたの?
400901201_12_a
あの轟音と地割れが起きたときも、
一瞬お迎えが来たのかと
思っちゃいました……
シリカ
400901201_11_a
あたしも、もうHPが
ほぼ尽きかけてましたよ……
シリカ
400901201_10_a
巨人の相手してただけだったけど……
リーファ
400901201_9_a
あはは……
あたしなんてただギャーギャー
言いながら、
リーファ
400901201_8_a
そのフラグを見つけて開放したのは、
やっぱりキリト君たちだからネ!
キミ達の功績ってもんだヨ!
アリシャ
400901201_7_a
そんなことないナイ!
黄金林檎のおかげで巨人たちは
だいぶ弱体化してたからネ
アリシャ
400901201_6_a
俺たちは巨人にやられてたはずだ
キリト
400901201_5_a
それは違うよ、アリシャさん
むしろあの窮地に竜騎士隊が
援軍をよこしてくれなきゃ、
キリト
400901201_4_a
リーファ
400901201_3_a
キリト
400901201_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
いやー、今回はキリト君たちに
ホントに助けられたヨ!
アリシャ
400901201_1_a
グラアアアアーーーッ!!!
霜の巨人
400901101_39_a
う、うん!
わかったよ!!
ユウキ
400901101_38_a
ユウキ、ここは俺が抑える!
あれを巨人に奪われるな!
先に手に入れるんだーーーっ!!!
キリト
400901101_37_a
巨人たちが反応してる!
ユウキ
400901101_36_a
ギギャア!
ギギャアアッ!!
霜の巨人
400901101_35_a
しかも……天辺に光る玉みたいなのが
見えるぞ!
あれが黄金林檎だ!
キリト
400901101_34_a
やった、これが恐らく苗木だ!
キリト
400901101_33_a
うわわっ!
急に土が隆起して
地中から大きな樹が生えてきたよ!!
ユウキ
400901101_32_a
えっ……あっ!
地面が光って……わっ!
ユウキ
400901101_31_a
ど、どうだ!?
キリト
400901101_30_a
わ、わかった……信じるよ、キリト!
そ、それ!!
ユウキ
400901101_29_a
また巨人が……!
キリト
400901101_28_a
グロアッ!!
霜の巨人
400901101_27_a
でも今はそれしか
試せることがないんだ!
キリト
400901101_26_a
ちょっともったいなくない!?
ユウキ
400901101_25_a
ええっ!?
そんなことしてどうなるの!?
ユウキ
400901101_24_a
そ、それをこの地面一帯に
振りかけてみてくれ!
キリト
400901101_23_a
う、うん
一個だけなら
ユウキ
400901101_22_a
ユウキ、世界樹の雫まだ持ってるか?
俺はさっき竜騎士達に
使い切っちまった!
キリト
400901101_21_a
……?
ユウキ
400901101_20_a
でもだからと言ってどうすれば……!
あっ、いや、なんとかなるかも!?
キリト
400901101_19_a
キリト?
ユウキ
400901101_18_a
そういうことか!?
キリト
400901101_17_a
大昔……
キリト
400901101_16_a
大昔に植林されたって言ってた
くらいだし、もう枯れちゃったとか?
ユウキ
400901101_15_a
だよな……
そもそも特別高い木なんてないし、
ホントにここに若木があるのかすら……
キリト
400901101_14_a
まだそれらしいのは何も……
ユウキ
400901101_13_a
敵の攻撃が止んでる際に、
できるだけ高い木を探ってみてるけど、
ユウキ
400901101_12_a
世界樹の若木……
黄金林檎は……
やっぱり見つからないか?
キリト
400901101_11_a
う、うん
はは、でもちょっと焦ってはいるかな
ユウキ
400901101_10_a
ユウキ、大丈夫か?
キリト
400901101_9_a
はぁ、はぁ……
ユウキ
400901101_8_a
リズ……シノン!
くっ……まさに泥仕合だな……!
キリト
400901101_7_a
しつっこいわね!!
シノン
400901101_6_a
シノン
400901101_5_a
ギャオオオオッ!!
霜の巨人
400901101_4_a
くっ!
400901101_3_a
400901101_2_a
bg_04_field_flower_snow
グラアアアッ!!
霜の巨人
400901101_1_a
でも今はそれしかないみたいね……!
400901001_37_a
あいつらと戦いながら木を探すなんて
難しすぎだよ～!
リーファ
400901001_36_a
ただし無理はするな!
何かあったら、さっきのアリシャの
いた所まで戻るんだ!
キリト
400901001_35_a
仕方ない……みんな応戦しつつ、
各自世界樹を探してくれ!
キリト
400901001_34_a
くっ、こっちに近づいてくる!
シノン
400901001_33_a
グロオオオオッーーー!!
霜の巨人
400901001_32_a
何!?
キリト
400901001_31_a
マズイ!
奴らに気づかれたわ!
シノン
400901001_30_a
どうしたの、シノン!?
400901001_29_a
……!
シノン
400901001_28_a
だから巨人たちも
こんなに探してるのに、
まだ見つけられていない……
キリト
400901001_27_a
小さいと他の木と見分けるのも
難しいかもしれない
キリト
400901001_26_a
そうだな……
世界樹の特徴って言うと、
やっぱりデカいことだからな……
キリト
400901001_25_a
この辺にある木って
そんなに高くないですよね
せいぜい10メートルくらいですよ
シリカ
400901001_24_a
で、でも実際どうやって探すの?
世界樹って言うくらいだから、
若木っていっても相当背が高いのかな?
リーファ
400901001_23_a
ボクももちろんOKだよ
ユウキ
400901001_22_a
は、はい、あたしも大丈夫です!
シリカ
400901001_21_a
そうね……
確かに気になるわね
400901001_20_a
私はその作戦でいいと思うわ
黄金林檎ってやつ……見てみたいし
シノン
400901001_19_a
確かに……正々堂々戦いを挑んでも、
竜騎士隊の二の舞になるだけだし……
400901001_18_a
でもこの状況でやれるのって、
もうそれくらいだと思うんだ
キリト
400901001_17_a
ええっ!?
それはイヤだよー!
リーファ
400901001_16_a
それとも先に取られたことに怒り、
こっちに向かって襲いかかって
くるのか……
キリト
400901001_15_a
それはわからん……
巨人たちは諦めて去っていくのか……
キリト
400901001_14_a
先に手に入れるとどうなるって言うの?
リーファ
400901001_13_a
黄金林檎を……ですか?
シリカ
400901001_12_a
それは……巨人たちよりも先に、
世界樹の若木、そして黄金林檎を
見つけるってことだ
キリト
400901001_11_a
確証はないんだが……
一つ試してみたいことがある
キリト
400901001_10_a
そ、そうよね……
キリト、これからどうするの?
400901001_9_a
巨人の目的がわかっても、
戦って勝てる戦力差じゃないでしょ?
ユウキ
400901001_8_a
でもこのままここにいて……
どうするの?
ユウキ
400901001_7_a
ええ、そして前に奪えなかった
黄金林檎を再び手に入れようと
しているんだわ……
シノン
400901001_6_a
でも近くで見て確信がいったわ
巨人たちは木の幹を執拗に探ってる
世界樹の若木を探してるんだわ
400901001_5_a
ううっ、すんごくドキドキする……
リーファ
400901001_4_a
400901001_3_a
リーファ
400901001_2_a
bg_04_field_flower_snow
か、かなり接近してますけど……
大丈夫でしょうか?
シリカ
400901001_1_a
うん!
ユウキ
400900901_19_a
ついにアリシャ達と戦った
主力部隊に追いついたか……
みんな十分注意してくれ!
キリト
400900901_18_a
あっ……
巨人たちの呻くような声がする……!
あの崖の先からだよ!
リーファ
400900901_17_a
よし……今はそれを信じて
俺たちは巨人たちの足取りを
追いかけよう!
キリト
400900901_16_a
はい!
アリシャさんは
これくらいじゃへこたれないはずです!
シリカ
400900901_15_a
うちの領主だからって褒めるわけじゃ
ないけど、転んでもただでは起きない
根性の持ち主だし
シノン
400900901_14_a
まだ戦えそうなメンツを揃えて、
あとから追いかけるって言ってたし、
平気じゃないかしら
シノン
400900901_13_a
そういえばアリシャさん達、
あそこに置いてきちゃったけど、
大丈夫かしら?
400900901_12_a
そうだな
キリト
400900901_11_a
だから木の実を物色してたんですね……
シリカ
400900901_10_a
戦力的に十分じゃないんでしょうね
シノン
400900901_9_a
そう考えるのが妥当ね
向こうもトップのスリュムはもういない
わけだし、
シノン
400900901_8_a
巨人たちは世界樹を直接狙うのを諦め、
そっちを狙ってきたってこと
なんですかね?
リーファ
400900901_7_a
この先のケットシー領の
山岳地帯のどこかで
育っている……ってことだったわね
400900901_6_a
アリシャさんの話によると……
大昔、世界樹イグドラシルの小さな
枝から作り上げ植林された若木が……
400900901_5_a
はい、
ケットシー領でそんな話があったなんて
あたし全然知りませんでした
シリカ
400900901_4_a
400900901_3_a
シリカ
400900901_2_a
bg_18_mountain_snow
やっぱり関係してたのね……
黄金林檎……
シノン
400900901_1_a
えっ?
アリシャ
400900801_25_a
あーっ!　そうでした!
アリシャさん、聞きたいことが!
リーファ
400900801_24_a
ああ、忘れてたわ!
400900801_23_a
……あっ!
キリト
400900801_22_a
敵の目的がわかれば、
もう少し攻略方法も練られると
思うんだが
キリト
400900801_21_a
その可能性もあるわけだし、
どちらにしろ今は敵を追いかける
必要があるな……
キリト
400900801_20_a
敵将討ち取ったり～ってやつですよね
リーファ
400900801_19_a
よくあるパターンだと、少数パーティで
敵軍に忍び込んで、敵の中枢を叩いて
撤退させるとかよね
シノン
400900801_18_a
ああ……
キリト
400900801_17_a
つまりクリアするための条件が、
何か他にあるってことね
シノン
400900801_16_a
強引にぶつかっていっても、
無駄にデスペナ増やすだけだと思う
キリト
400900801_15_a
ああ、ユウキの言うとおり、
今回のクエストは恐らく巨人の軍勢を
全滅させることがクリア条件じゃない
キリト
400900801_14_a
えっ……?
400900801_13_a
巨人を倒すだけなら、ね
ユウキ
400900801_12_a
種族混合の熟練プレイヤーで
レイド組むくらいじゃないと
無理じゃないかな
ユウキ
400900801_11_a
そうだね
話を聞くだけでも
ユウキ
400900801_10_a
こんな少数パーティで
相手になるはずないわ
シノン
400900801_9_a
たとえ熟練度が高いプレイヤーが
複数いたとしても、
シノン
400900801_8_a
ケットシーの最強を誇る
竜騎士隊を投入してもこうなったのよ
シノン
400900801_7_a
だよな……
キリト
400900801_6_a
うん、それはちょっと無理だと思うわ
キリト……
400900801_5_a
さすがにそれは無謀と言うしかないヨ!
アリシャ

キリト

bg_18_mountain_snow
キリト君?
まさかその人数で巨人と戦う気なノ?
アリシャ
400900801_1_a
あの山の向こう側……か
キリト
400900701_29_a
まるで竜騎士隊なんて、
眼中にないとばかりに……ネ
アリシャ
400900701_28_a
こっちを蹴散らしたかと思ったら、
一目散にあの山の向こう側に消えて
行ったヨ
アリシャ
400900701_27_a
アリシャ、
それで巨人たちはどこに行ったの?
シノン
400900701_26_a
大勢で襲われたら
ひとたまりもなかったのかもね……
リーファ
400900701_25_a
前にエクスキャリバーのクエストを
やったときは、相手がスリュム一人
だったから、なんとかなったけど、
リーファ
400900701_24_a
北欧神話でも巨人の勢力って、
恐ろしいって言われてるから……
リーファ
400900701_23_a
まさか竜騎士隊の力でも
敵わないなんて……
シリカ
400900701_22_a
負けたというか混戦で
両者犠牲者多数……って感じカナ
善戦はしたと思うケド……
アリシャ
400900701_21_a
ってことは……
負けたの?
巨人たちに?
シノン
400900701_20_a
あはは……いやぁ……
竜騎士隊の実力を以ってしても、
ダメだったヨ……
アリシャ
400900701_19_a
な、何があったんだ?
キリト
400900701_18_a
お、おい!
軽口言ってる場合じゃないだろ?
キリト
400900701_17_a
や、やあやあ、キリト君……
我らの……りょ、領地へ……
ヨウコソ……
アリシャ
400900701_16_a
大丈夫か!?
キリト
400900701_15_a
ぐっ……!
アリシャ
400900701_14_a
何!?
キリト
400900701_13_a
アリシャ
400900701_12_a
キリト!
こっち!
アリシャを蘇生できたわ!!
シノン
400900701_11_a
キリト
400900701_10_a
よし……
手分けしてケットシーの竜騎士隊を
助けるんだ!
キリト
400900701_9_a
そ、そうだね!
蘇生魔法か世界樹の雫を使えば
まだ間に合うプレイヤーもいるかも!
リーファ
400900701_8_a
み、みんなボーっとしないで!
まだいくつもリメインライトが
残ってるよ!
ユウキ
400900701_7_a
既に戦争が終わっちゃったって
こと……?
400900701_6_a
更地に誰の姿もない……
ケットシーも巨人も……!

あっ……鬨の声が……!
すごく大勢が戦ってる音……!
リーファ
400900601_16_a
あの峠を越えた先のはずです!
シリカ
400900601_15_a
みんなそろそろ戦場の前線に着くわよ!
周囲の様子には十分気を配って!
シノン
400900601_14_a
別に褒められるわけじゃないと
思うが……
キリト
400900601_13_a
そ、そうかな……えへへ
リーファ
400900601_12_a
ふふふっ、さすが兄妹だね
漫才みてるみたいだったよ
ユウキ
400900601_11_a
あはは、言ったそばからそれだよ
というか最近全然鍛えてないでしょ、
現実だと
リーファ
400900601_10_a
っ……えっくしょい!
キリト
400900601_9_a
お、俺は普段から鍛えてるから
平気なんだ……
キリト
400900601_8_a
気づかないなんて鈍感なんだから!
リーファ
400900601_7_a
ほら、お兄ちゃん
あたし達の言ったとおりでしょ?
リーファ
400900601_6_a
竜騎士隊と巨人の主力同士が
ぶつかってる場所が近づくにつれて、
そうなってる気がするわ……
400900601_5_a
やっぱりそうよね

リーファ

確かにどんどん気温が
下がってる気がする……
キリト
400900601_1_a
そうかもしれないな……
キリト
400900501_27_a
霜の巨人の力が気候にも影響を
与え始めてるってこと……?
シノン
400900501_26_a
このイベントのこともあるし、
ちょっと気になるね
ユウキ
400900501_25_a
大陸北部に比べれば大した寒さじゃない
と思うけど、
ユウキ
400900501_24_a
はい、そのはずです
シリカ
400900501_23_a
この辺って年中温暖なエリアだった
気がするわ
シノン
400900501_22_a
確かに気温が下がってるかも……
でも……変ね
シノン
400900501_21_a
ぐしゅん!
ちょっと冷えてきたわね……
400900501_20_a
うおっ!
スグかよ!
キリト
400900501_19_a
あくしょん!
リーファ
400900501_18_a
リズ……?
キリト
400900501_17_a
そうねぇ……
ううっ……はっ、はっ……
400900501_16_a
ケットシーの主力部隊と合流、ついでに
アリシャさんにその話もしてみよう
ユウキ
400900501_15_a
そうだね
早くここを突破して
ユウキ
400900501_14_a
そうか……いや大丈夫だ
どちらにしろアリシャさん達を
助けに行くつもりだったからな
キリト
400900501_13_a
でもアリシャさんなら
何か知ってるかもしれませんね……
シリカ
400900501_12_a
すみません、
あたしも聞いたことないです
シリカ
400900501_11_a
私は何も……
シリカはどう?
シノン
400900501_10_a
そうなんだよな……シノンにシリカ
この森と世界樹について、何か
関連ありそうな話を聞いたことないか?
キリト
400900501_9_a
ケットシー領の森だと
見つからないんじゃ……
400900501_8_a
でも確か黄金林檎って、
世界樹イグドラシルになる実
だったわね?
400900501_7_a
キリト
400900501_6_a
つまり霜の巨人たちが
最終的に地上に出て奪おうとしてる
やつだよね

これはただの思いつきなんだが……
キリト
400900401_18_a
キリト、どうしたの?
400900401_17_a
いや……そうなのか?
キリト
400900401_16_a
おいおい、いくら巨人がデカいからって
わざわざ木の実を食べるために
地上まで上がってくるわけ……
キリト
400900401_15_a
木の実でも食べたいのかなぁ?
リーファ
400900401_14_a
森の中を進みながら、
木の幹を物色してる……?
ユウキ
400900401_13_
でも……うん
確かに何か探してるみたいだね……
ユウキ
400900401_12_a
おおっ、
さすがは視力のいいケットシーだな
助かるぜ
キリト
400900401_11_a
足元や自分の近くばかりを
ウロウロと見回してる感じです
シリカ
400900401_10_a
はい、こっちから見てると
そんな様子ですね
シリカ
400900401_9_a
この距離なら気づかれないはず
シノン
400900401_8_a
大丈夫よ
霜の巨人たちはそこまで視力が
良くないみたい
シノン
400900401_7_a
これくらいじゃないと、奴らが
何をしようとしてるのか
見えないからな……
キリト
400900401_6_a
た、確かにギリギリの距離だが……
キリト

そう……何かを探してる感じだった
リーファ
400900301_18_a
なんか戦うわけでも
暴れるわけでもなく……
辺りをジッと窺う感じで……
リーファ
400900301_17_a
変って……具体的にどんな感じなんだ?
キリト
400900301_16_a
それに……敵の様子が……
ちょっと変だったんだよ
リーファ
400900301_15_a
そ、そうですよね……
シリカ
400900301_14_a
さすがに戦力に差があったとしても、
この短時間でケットシーの竜騎士隊が
全滅するなんてことはないと思うよ
ユウキ
400900301_13_a
どういうことでしょう?
アリシャさん達……まさかもう……!
シリカ
400900301_12_a
えっ……?
そうなの……?
シノン
400900301_11_a
今上空から周囲の様子を見てたけど、
あっちの方角にも敵が結構いるよ!
リーファ
400900301_10_a
リーファ、どうしたんだ?
キリト

お兄ちゃん!　みんな!

400900301_7_a
は、はい
そこできっとアリシャさん達が
今も戦ってるはずです……!
シリカ
400900301_6_a

もちろんアリシャさん達は助ける……

い、いや、そういうつもりじゃない
ただ無謀に突っ込むのは
短絡的だってことだよ
キリト
400900201_17_a
お兄ちゃん、やる前から諦めるの!?
リーファ

この人数で助勢したところで、
たかが知れてるだろ?
戦況がそこまで変わるとは思えない
キリト
400900201_15_a
いや安心するのは早いぞ
それだけの軍勢の巨人が
押し寄せてきたんだ
キリト
400900201_14_a
ユ、ユウキさん……
皆さん……ありがとうございます!
シリカ
400900201_13_a
種族として助けは出せなくても、
仲の良いプレイヤー同士なら
協力し合えるもん!

うん、でもだからこそ、
ボク達の出番ってわけだよね!

400900201_11_a
どこもケットシー領内で起きてる
種族限定のイベントっていう認識が
強いみたいで……
リーファ
400900201_10_a
でも残念ながら……今の所、
まだ静観してる種族が大半みたいですよ
リーファ
400900201_9_a
こうして他の種族にも助けを呼ぶように
ことづかってきたわけ
シノン
400900201_8_a
やっぱりケットシーの勢力だけじゃ
限界があって……
シノン
400900201_7_a
今アリシャが竜騎士隊を全員出動させて
迎撃に当たってるけど、
シノン
400900201_6_a
確かに大ごとって感じね
どうしてケットシー領を狙ったのかは、
わからないけど……
400900201_5_a
は、はい
シリカ
400900201_4_a
400900201_3_a
シリカ
400900201_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
なるほど……
あの巨人族がついに攻めてきたってか
キリト
400900201_1_a
よし……竜騎士隊!
全軍出撃!
アリシャ
400900101_28_a
もちろんだヨ!
アリシャ
400900101_27_a
わ、わかりました!
アリシャさんも気をつけてくださいね!
シリカ
400900101_26_a
そういうことだヨ
これはかなり大規模なイベントクエスト
の予感がするヨ……!
アリシャ
400900101_25_a
確かにケットシーだけの
問題じゃなさそう
だものね……
シノン
400900101_24_a
えっ!?
シリカ
400900101_23_a
シリカちゃん、シノンちゃん!
作戦変更だヨ!
二人はキリト君たちに援軍を頼んデ!
アリシャ
400900101_22_a
ムムムッ……そっちにも出たカ……!
アリシャ
400900101_21_a
シノンさん!
シリカ
400900101_20_a
アリシャ!　シリカ!
大変よ!　巨人たちがケットシー領の
山岳地帯にも出現したって!
シノン
400900101_19_a
ど、どうなんでしょう……?
シリカ
400900101_18_a
ナルホド……じゃあ今回のは
シナリオ的に継続してるわけ
じゃないのカ?
アリシャ
400900101_17_a
地上が襲われるなんて心配も
無くなったって思ってたんですけど……
シリカ
400900101_16_a
一応敵の王スリュムは倒しましたし、
事態も解決したはずですよ
シリカ
400900101_15_a
その時は……
アリシャ
400900101_14_a
あっ、はい
シリカ
400900101_13_a
確かシリカって、
あのエクスキャリバーのクエストを
キリト君たちとやったんだったよネ?
アリシャ
400900101_12_a
そ、それはどうなんでしょう……?
シリカ
400900101_11_a
最初にケットシー領を襲ってくるなんて
奴らケットシーに何か恨みでも、
あるのカナ?
アリシャ
400900101_10_a
ヨツンヘイムよりも更に下の
地下世界から、霜の巨人たちが
攻めてくるなんて……
シリカ
400900101_9_a
ですね
ニブルヘイム……
シリカ
400900101_8_a
それにしても……
まさかこんなイベントが
起きるなんてネ……
アリシャ
400900101_7_a
わ、わかりました……!
シリカ
400900101_6_a
とりあえず今はここで
待機しててくれるカナ?
アリシャ
400900101_5_a
うーん、そうだネ……
シリカは強いけど、いざというときの
ための戦力も温存しておきたいシ……
アリシャ
400900101_4_a
アリシャさん!
あたしもお手伝いします!
どうすればいいですか!?
シリカ
400900101_3_a
ハッ!
了解です!
ケットシーのプレイヤー
400900101_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
竜騎士隊、五つの小隊に編成し直すヨ!
今から現地に急行する!
アリシャ
400900101_1_a
Give me a break!!
Kirito
400801201_33_a
Noooooope!
Leafa
400801201_32_a
C-Can't we work this out some
other way?
Kirito
400801201_31_a
Leafa, normal people can't handle
that kind of speed!
Kirito
400801201_30_a
Aww, c'mon!
I just want to lend you my really
rare piece of equipment!
Leafa
400801201_29_a
What the hell kind of rule
is that?!
Kirito
400801201_28_a
AT FULL SPEED!
Extra laps if you slow down even
one bit!
Leafa
400801201_27_a
I-Is that it...?
Kirito
400801201_26_a
Ooh, I've got an idea!
Why don't you take a little trip
on the broom!
Leafa
400801201_25_a
What the hell?!
I thought we were cool!
Kirito
400801201_24_a
You are SO GROSS, Kazuto!
Leafa
400801201_23_a
Now I'm grossed out all over
again!
Leafa
400801201_22_a
Hm? Oh... OH GEEZ!
Yeah, thanks for the reminder!
Leafa
400801201_21_a
Gah! Why'd you have to bring that
up again, Yui?!
Kirito
400801201_20_a
Say what?
Leafa
400801201_19_a
Isn't it great that Leafa's not
mad at you anymore, Daddy?
Yui
400801201_18_a
Ehehe...
Yui
400801201_17_a
Yes! I just said so!
Kirito
400801201_16_a
Is that what you REALLY think?
Leafa
400801201_15_a
I mean, it's yours, so you should
enjoy it! Y'know?
Kirito
400801201_14_a
N-No, I'm not scared, it's just-
Kirito
400801201_13_a
Hehehe, aww, are you scared?
Leafa
400801201_12_a
Uh, no... I'll pass.
It looks WAY too fast for me.
Kirito
400801201_11_a
Do you wanna give it a shot?
Leafa
400801201_10_a
Yeah, I think so.
It's a different feel compared to
flying with your wings. I like it!
Leafa
400801201_9_a
Looks like you've already gotten
used to it!
Kirito
400801201_8_a
Phew! And I'm back!
Leafa
400801201_7_a
She sure does, doesn't she?
Kirito
400801201_6_a
Haha, Leafa looks like a real
witch up on that broom!
Yui
400801201_5_a
Yui
400801201_4_a
Oh yeah?
I'm glad to hear it!
Kirito
400801201_3_a
Do you see how fast
this thing is, Kirito?
It's so much fun!!
Leafa
400801201_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
Whoa, geez!
Too fast, too fast!
Leafa
400801201_1_a
What! Really?! Are you sure?
Leafa
400801101_25_a
It has to be Leafa!
Silica
400801101_24_a
Hehehe... Yep!
Liz
400801101_23_a
Yep. There's only one choice here.
Kirito
400801101_22_a
Indeed. But any item with a speed
boost should obviously go to...
Asuna
400801101_21_a
And in the end, it does exactly
what you'd expect a witch's broom
to do.
Sinon
400801101_20_a
A flight speed boost, eh?
Kirito
400801101_19_a
The Witch's Broom appears to
increase the flight speed of
whoever equips it.
Yui
400801101_18_a
Obviously we won't be able to
shapeshift, but it can't hurt to
see what it actually does.
Leafa
400801101_17_a
Good idea.
Leafa
400801101_16_a
Maybe we should see what it does
before we give it away.
Asuna
400801101_15_a
Does anybody want it?
Liz
400801101_14_a
It says that each party that took
part in the candy collection
gets one broom.
Kirito
400801101_13_a
I suppose there's no reason we'd
all get one.
Silica
400801101_12_a
Oh...
It actually shows up as the
"Witch's Broom."
Silica
400801101_11_a
Yeah, barely.
So what do we do with this reward?
Sinon
400801101_10_a
Yeah...remember when this was just
a candy collection quest?
Liz
400801101_9_a
And now-finally-the Halloween
event is over.
Leafa
400801101_8_a
It must have been allowed as a
special battle or something.
Kirito
400801101_7_a
Phew.
I'm still a little shocked that
we just fought in a safe zone.
Sinon
400801101_6_a
Yes! We beat him!
Asuna
400801101_5_a
Kirito
400801101_4_a
Sinon
400801101_3_a
Asuna
400801101_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Guaaaagh!
Kobold
400801101_1_a
Seriously, though!
Can we talk about why he
had to turn into me again?!
Leafa
400801001_49_a
Can't win as a Kobold, eh?
Okay, gang, this'll be confusing,
but we can handle it!
Kirito
400801001_48_a
He turned into Leafa!
Asuna
400801001_47_a
Kirito
400801001_46_a
Asuna
400801001_45_a
Me again! For real?!
Leafa
400801001_44_a
Like this!
Leafa(Kobold)
400801001_43_a
Liz
400801001_42_a
Sinon
400801001_41_a
Kirito
400801001_40_a
Tch!
I'll just turn into someone
really strong!
Kobold
400801001_39_a
Hah! You really think you can win?
Sinon
400801001_38_a
Argh, enough with the yammering!
I'll put an end to all of you!
Kobold
400801001_37_a
It's just like a crime drama,
right? You don't want any
witnesses.
Kirito
400801001_36_a
I just put myself in his shoes,
and I figured he couldn't leave
me alone. I was a loose end.
Kirito
400801001_35_a
Yeah, for real!
How'd you figure it out, Kirito?
Liz
400801001_34_a
Staying in town and trying to make
contact again was the right call.
Nice job, Kirito.
Sinon
400801001_33_a
Yui
400801001_32_a
Phew! Nice timing, guys!
Kirito
400801001_31_a
Leafa
400801001_30_a
Yeah! There's nowhere to run!
Silica
400801001_29_a
We've got you surrounded!
Leafa
400801001_28_a
Silica
400801001_27_a
Leafa
400801001_26_a
Not this time!
Asuna
400801001_25_a
He's getting away again, Daddy!
Yui
400801001_24_a
Damn it...!
Kobold
400801001_23_a
But the biggest red flag was the
reprisal of those awful seduction
techniques.
Kirito
400801001_22_a
A friendly avatar with no visible
stats, poor acting...
There were a ton of clues.
Kirito
400801001_21_a
You slipped up the second you came
onto me like that.
Kirito
400801001_20_a
Grrr!
Kobold
400801001_19_a
Wha-!
Asuna(???)
400801001_18_a
Nah, we should wait. The more the
merrier, right? You sneaky
Kobold thief!
Kirito
400801001_17_a
B-But Kirito!
What happened to "just us"?
Asuna(???)
400801001_16_a
There. I just sent a message to
everyone. They'll be here any
moment.
Kirito
400801001_15_a
Well, I was thinking maybe we...
That it'd be nice to go
together. Just the two of us.
Asuna(???)
400801001_14_a
Okay. Give me a sec to tell the
others.
Kirito
400801001_13_a
Let's get out of town and see if
he turns up.
Asuna(???)
400801001_12_a
Yeah, I'm starting to think that
myself.
Kirito
400801001_11_a
Maybe he's not in town anymore.
Asuna(???)
400801001_10_a
Huh. Hey, maybe...
Asuna(???)
400801001_9_a
Hey, Asuna. No, not yet.
Kirito
400801001_8_a
Kirito! Have you found him?
Asuna(???)
400801001_7_a
Well, uh, I-
Kirito
400801001_6_a
What do you mean, Daddy?
Yui
400801001_5_a
Still, if he targets any of us,
it'll be me he comes for.
Kirito
400801001_4_a
Not yet. But he's seen my face,
and he's probably on the lookout
for me.
Kirito
400801001_3_a
Kirito
400801001_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
We haven't found him yet, have we?
Yui
400801001_1_a
Yeah. Hang in there!
Kirito
400800901_28_a
Well, it's a tall order, but I
guess that's the only way we'll
smoke him out.
Sinon
400800901_27_a
We're gonna have to do that with
every NPC in this town, aren't we?
Sinon
400800901_26_a
He'll probably reveal himself if
you start to question him.
Leafa
400800901_25_a
It's pretty straightforward.
Kirito
400800901_24_a
and talking to any NPCs that show
up when they're not supposed to.
Kirito
400800901_23_a
Taking notes of where and how many
NPCs spawn, figuring out their
spawning patterns,
Kirito
400800901_22_a
What kind of legwork?
Asuna
400800901_21_a
We'll just have to do some good,
old-fashioned legwork.
Kirito
400800901_20_a
That could be.
As for how to catch him...
Kirito
400800901_19_a
Fair point.
Sinon
400800901_18_a
He's probably not very strong to
begin with. Kobolds and goblins
aren't the most imposing enemies.
Silica
400800901_17_a
Why even shapeshift in the first
place? Is he trying to avoid a
fight for some reason?
Sinon
400800901_16_a
He's probably hiding out in plain
sight, disguised as another fairy
by now.
Liz
400800901_15_a
But how do we even find him?
Even assuming he's still in town.
Liz
400800901_14_a
I should hope so.
Kirito
400800901_13_a
It's probably something that only
evil NPCs can use.
Asuna
400800901_12_a
I wouldn't think so.
That sounds like a recipe for a
VRMMO crime wave.
Kirito
400800901_11_a
And could players still use its
powers if they do get to keep it?
Sinon
400800901_10_a
If we complete the quest, I mean.
Sinon
400800901_9_a
Out of curiosity...
do we get to, you know,
keep the broom?
Sinon
400800901_8_a
So he can take the form of
different players...
That's pretty scary!
Silica
400800901_7_a
Who knows what he looks like now!
We all need to be on high alert.
Kirito
400800901_6_a
We can't say that for sure,
but he definitely morphed into a
perfect copy of Leafa.
Kirito
400800901_5_a
So you're saying he's still around
here somewhere?
Liz
400800901_4_a
I know! That Kobold used the
broom's power to shapeshift
and blend in with the crowd.
Leafa
400800901_3_a
Leafa
400800901_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
That's unbelievable...
Asuna
400800901_1_a
She's right. Let's go!
Kirito
400800801_25_a
We should meet back up with Mommy
and everybody else!
Yui
400800801_24_a
Okay, good! Now that you've
made up, let's get back to looking
for that Kobold!
Yui
400800801_23_a
Well...yeah.
Leafa
400800801_22_a
It was my fault, though.
Kirito
400800801_21_a
I overreacted back there.
Leafa
400800801_20_a
No, I owe you an apology.
Leafa
400800801_19_a
I'm sorry, Sugu...
He was right up against me too.
Kirito
400800801_18_a
Ugh, but now we have to go looking
for him all over again. Just when
I thought we had him...!
Leafa
400800801_17_a
I've gotta hand it to him. That's
actually pretty clever.
Kirito
400800801_16_a
Yeah. He spread a rumor that he'd
escaped, so he could hide out
here in town.
Leafa
400800801_15_a
No wonder he was using the
language that only Cait Sith can
hear. He was a monster all along!
Kirito
400800801_14_a
He turned into a fairy NPC and
spread false information about
himself.
Kirito
400800801_13_a
Got it.
So that's how it is.
Kirito
400800801_12_a
Oh, and I think the broom lets
people shapeshift. Sorry, I
should've led with that.
Leafa
400800801_11_a
Uh huh.
I think the transformation wears
off after a while.
Leafa
400800801_10_a
Seriously?
Kirito
400800801_9_a
So I kept pressing him for more
info, and that's when he up and
turned into a Kobold!
Leafa
400800801_8_a
This NPC didn't look like the
one Sinon and Silica had talked
to, which bugged me slightly.
Leafa
400800801_7_a
Then another NPC told me that
the NPC we were looking for didn't
exist.
Leafa
400800801_6_a
Right. I went looking for that NPC
after I told you off.
Leafa
400800801_5_a
What the hell happened, Sugu?
Kirito
400800801_4_a
pant
Just a little bit faster
and we could've cornered him...
Leafa
400800801_3_a
Leafa
400800801_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Damn... We lost him.
Kirito
400800801_1_a
Pah! Like I'd wait for YOU idiots!
I'm outta here!
Kobold
400800701_31_a
I KNEW something was off!
Kirito
400800701_30_a
That's him, Kazuto!
That's the Kobold we're after!
Leafa
400800701_29_a
Wait, where'd you get that broom?
Is that-?!
Kirito
400800701_28_a
But now she's running toward
us again!
Yui
400800701_27_a
Kirito
400800701_26_a
Daddy, I don't know what's going
on! I think Leafa turned evil...
Yui
400800701_25_a
HEY!
Get back here!!!
Leafa
400800701_24_a
Yui
400800701_23_a
I don't-I can't-?
What just happened?!
Kirito
400800701_22_a
Today is NOT my day...
???
400800701_21_a
Hmph. So, then.
She's a "friend" of yours?
Leafa(???)
400800701_20_a
Um... Leafa?
Yui
400800701_19_a
Whoa! What're you snuggling up
to me for?!
Kirito
400800701_18_a
Geez! Leafa, what the hell are
you doing?!
Kirito
400800701_17_a
If you help me, I'll make it worth
your while...
Leafa(???)
400800701_16_a
What the hell...?
Kirito
400800701_15_a
Hey! Hey, you over there!
Please help me!
Leafa(???)
400800701_14_a
Huh?
Kirito
400800701_13_a
Uh oh...
Is that Leafa coming this way?
Yui
400800701_12_a
Y-Yeah, okay...
Kirito
400800701_11_a
Let's spend our energy searching
instead of complaining!
Yui
400800701_10_a
We have to do our part to find
out where that NPC is!
Yui
400800701_9_a
Hehe, cheer up, Daddy!
Yui
400800701_8_a
I thought they were gonna kill me.
I can still feel the heat of
their stares...
Kirito
400800701_7_a
If you can call staring daggers
into my very soul while forcing
me to sit on my knees forgiving...
Kirito
400800701_6_a
They forgave you, though,
didn't they?
Yui
400800701_5_a
I'm feeling down, Yui.
Kirito
400800701_4_a
Are you okay, Daddy?
Yui
400800701_3_a
Yui
400800701_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
sigh
Kirito
400800701_1_a
gulp
Okay...
Kirito
400800601_32_a
Don't make me.
Now, are you gonna tell us what's
up?
Asuna
400800601_31_a
Wha-!
I mean, let's not do anything
crazy!
Kirito
400800601_30_a
Call it a hunch...
Fine. I'll let it go for now, but
I'm asking Leafa about this later.
Asuna
400800601_29_a
Whaaaat?
I mean, no! Nothing's up, Asuna.
Why would anything be up?
Kirito
400800601_28_a
Nope. Something's up.
Asuna
400800601_27_a
Let's just stick to the...y'know,
the plan! We've got an NPC to
find!
Kirito
400800601_26_a
Oh. Really?
Silica
400800601_25_a
Sh-She'll be back...uh, soon
I think!
Kirito
400800601_24_a
Ahhh!
Not a word! I told you!
Kirito
400800601_23_a
Actually, Leafa is-
Yui
400800601_22_a
Wasn't she with you, Kirito?
Liz
400800601_21_a
What happened to Leafa?
Silica
400800601_20_a
Okay, that's everyo-wait...
Sinon
400800601_19_a
Sinon
400800601_18_a
Hey Kirito! Sorry I'm late!
Asuna
400800601_17_a
I know...
Wait, why is my own daughter
giving me life lessons?
Kirito
400800601_16_a
You two may be related, but she's
at a difficult age.
Yui
400800601_15_a
Hehe, just kidding!
But you should be more careful!
Yui
400800601_14_a
Hey, hey, WHOA!
No, Yui! Don't-!
Kirito
400800601_13_a
I-I'm sorry, Daddy.
I have to report this to Mommy.
Yui
400800601_12_a
At least, I THOUGHT she was done.
So I went to the bathroom...
And walked in on her getting out.
Kirito
400800601_11_a
She and I agreed to log out and
take baths, so I logged off when
Sugu was done.
Kirito
400800601_10_a
We all took turns logging out
earlier, right? Well, I was up
after Sugu.
Kirito
400800601_9_a
O-Okay...
Yui
400800601_8_a
Well, um... Look, don't tell Mommy
about this, okay?
Kirito
400800601_7_a
What happened, Daddy?
Yui
400800601_6_a
...
Kirito
400800601_5_a
Just stop! Get out of my face!
Leafa
400800601_4_a
Wait up, Sugu! I said I'm sorry!
It was an accident!
Kirito
400800601_3_a
Kirito
400800601_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
ARGH! You are DISGUSTING, Kazuto!
How dare you?!
Leafa
400800601_1_a
That'd be great.
Let's head back to town and have
a look.
Kirito
400800501_14_a
That's possible.
I remember what the NPC looked
like. I can describe them to you.
Sinon
400800501_13_a
If the NPC can talk with a Kobold,
maybe it was fed incorrect info.
Kirito
400800501_12_a
Right...
Silica
400800501_11_a
The thing I keep turning over in
my head is why the NPC would be
muttering.
Kirito
400800501_10_a
Sure, whatever.
Sinon
400800501_9_a
Haha, easy, Sinon! It's just an
NPC. Let's not get too crazy.
Kirito
400800501_8_a
Smart move. If the NPC was lying,
then we can grill it 'n' find out
why.
Sinon
400800501_7_a
Let's head back to the village
and talk to that NPC one more
time.
Asuna
400800501_6_a
You might be right about that...
Asuna
400800501_5_a
Was the NPC's info a lie?
Maybe that player was telling
the truth.
Kirito
400800501_4_a
I'm with Liz!
If we haven't found it by now,
there's not much hope...
Leafa
400800501_3_a
Leafa
400800501_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Phew...
Yeah...I don't think...
gasp
it's here...
Liz
400800501_1_a
Agreed. Carrying on.
Sinon
400800401_17_a
And we've come this far.
We should search this whole
area for ourselves.
Kirito
400800401_16_a
Hmm... There's always the chance
that they're lying.
Kirito
400800401_15_a
Wh-What should we do, Kirito?
Asuna
400800401_14_a
Yes. They said they've been out
here for almost an hour.
Silica
400800401_13_a
Have they been looking around
here the whole time, Silica?
Liz
400800401_12_a
No way...
Kirito
400800401_11_a
And they, uh...
They said they haven't seen it
either...
Silica
400800401_10_a
It seems they're looking for the
Kobold too...
Silica
400800401_9_a
I went over there to see what I
could find, and I ran into another
party...
Silica
400800401_8_a
What is it, Silica?
Kirito
400800401_7_a
H-Hey, guys?
Silica
400800401_6_a
We won't find it if we don't have
a look around.
Leafa
400800401_5_a
I've got a pretty good feeling
about this. We should find it in
no time.
Asuna
400800401_4_a
I do not know if it is here at the
moment, but I have heard that
it headed in this direction.
Yui
400800401_3_a
Yui
400800401_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Our Kobold should be somewhere
around here, huh?
Kirito
400800401_1_a
Good idea!
Leafa
400800301_29_a
I think we should ask that NPC
if they know where that Kobold
got off to.
Kirito
400800301_28_a
Let's put that aside for now.
Kirito
400800301_27_a
Me neither...
Silica
400800301_26_a
I'm not sure.
If it was, I certainly didn't
notice.
Sinon
400800301_25_a
But then why was this NPC speaking
so quietly? Is it some sort of
secret?
Asuna
400800301_24_a
There is a specific language that
only Cait Sith players can hear,
I think.
Yui
400800301_23_a
Cait Siths have the ability to
understand monsters.
Yui
400800301_22_a
Though, now that I think about it,
I did notice someone who was
using some strange words.
Kirito
400800301_21_a
Which means that only you two
Cait Sith could hear it. Or Leafa,
being a Sylph and all.
Kirito
400800301_20_a
Same.
Sinon
400800301_19_a
I just happened to hear it from
a fairy NPC who was muttering
quietly.
Silica
400800301_18_a
Wait, you heard that too, Silica?
How'd they figure that out
so easily?
Liz
400800301_17_a
I heard that too!
Maybe we talked to the same
person.
Silica
400800301_16_a
Yeah, pretty much.
Sinon
400800301_15_a
So that Kobold snatched up the
broom before we could collect it?
Leafa
400800301_14_a
The culprit appears to be one of
the witch's Kobold minions.
Sinon
400800301_13_a
But-and there's always a but-the
broom alone disappeared before
we noticed.
Sinon
400800301_12_a
We were supposed to gather up all
of the witch's equipment once
we defeated her. Or so it says.
Sinon
400800301_11_a
Ahem... As I was saying...
Sinon
400800301_10_a
Y-You're right. Sorry.
Kirito
400800301_9_a
Are you patronizing me?!
I'm not some recluse like you,
y'know.
Sinon
400800301_8_a
You're usually so reserved!
But I guess it's different when
it comes to NPCs.
Kirito
400800301_7_a
What's great?
Sinon
400800301_6_a
Whoa, that's great!
Kirito
400800301_5_a
Well, that didn't take long.
I got some info from an NPC.
Sinon
400800301_4_a
Yeah, it looks like everyone had
the same idea we did,
given the lack of hints.
Asuna
400800301_3_a
Asuna
400800301_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
Wow, there really are a lot of
players here.
Kirito
400800301_1_a
That's enough for me.
Let's go.
Kirito
400800201_13_a
It's part of the special Halloween
event area, so there should be
lots of players and NPCs around.
Yui
400800201_12_a
I think that's a good idea.
Yui
400800201_11_a
Right. Well, should we start by
going back to the candy shop?
Sinon
400800201_10_a
We just don't know what that
power is yet.
Leafa
400800201_9_a
But it's not just any broom we're
looking for. This one has some
serious magic power, apparently.
Leafa
400800201_8_a
Mm-hm...
Leafa
400800201_7_a
A broom... A broom...
Well, witches use their brooms to
fly, right?
Silica
400800201_6_a
I think some intelligence
gathering is in order.
Yui
400800201_5_a
That IS really vague.
We don't even get any hints!
Liz
400800201_4_a
Yep.
Kirito
400800201_3_a
Kirito
400800201_2_a
bg_21_alne
We have to find the witch's broom?
Asuna
400800201_1_a
Of course not.
Put the word out to everyone!
Kirito
400800101_22_a
Hehe. That's not gonna stop you,
though, is it?
Leafa
400800101_21_a
Now it's a detective game all of
a sudden.
Kirito
400800101_20_a
Yeah, I thought there'd be a
clearer objective. "Defeat boss X"
or "Get the candy back again."
Kirito
400800101_19_a
Okay, good, I'm not the only one
who thought that!
Leafa
400800101_18_a
That's a bit anticlimactic.
Kirito
400800101_17_a
That appears to be the case.
I've just found the information
for this quest.
Yui
400800101_16_a
So the second half of this quest
is the hunt for her broom?
Kirito
400800101_15_a
I've heard it's her powerful
magic broom!
Leafa
400800101_14_a
What do you mean by "gear"?
Kirito
400800101_13_a
Well, she was the boss of all
those thieving monsters, and her
gear is still out there somewhere!
Leafa
400800101_12_a
Remember how we defeated that
witch mob at the end?
Leafa
400800101_11_a
What's that?
Kirito
400800101_10_a
There's one last thing we haven't
done!
Leafa
400800101_9_a
So we've returned all the candy,
which put the candy shop back in
business. But...
Leafa
400800101_8_a
Yeah, the one where we had to
get all that stolen candy back.
Kirito
400800101_7_a
That's the one!
Leafa
400800101_6_a
You mean the continuation of the
Halloween quest we completed
earlier?
Yui
400800101_5_a
The second half of the Halloween
event is live!
Leafa
400800101_4_a
Yui
400800101_3_a
What's up, Leafa?
Kirito
400800101_2_a
bg_21_alne
Kirito! Yui!
Leafa
400800101_1_a
Kirito
400701201_25_a
Asuna
400701201_24_a
Trick or treat!
Hehehe, I love Halloween!
Yui
400701201_23_a
We sure can!
Leafa
400701201_22_a
Same here! Now we can approach
the second half with the same
enthusiasm!
Silica
400701201_21_a
For now, I'm just glad we finished
the first part.
Leafa
400701201_20_a
Y-You bet I can.
And I will.
Sinon
400701201_19_a
Hehe, well, you can leave that to
the rest of us if need be, Sinon.
Liz
400701201_18_a
I hope it's one we can do without
all the crowd sourcing crap.
Sinon
400701201_17_a
At least, that's what the
announcement said.
Silica
400701201_16_a
I heard that too!
It sounds like there's more to it.
Silica
400701201_15_a
I know, right?
I've heard that's not the end of
the Halloween event, though.
Yuuki
400701201_14_a
I just can't believe we went from
last place to the first to finish
that quest.
Sinon
400701201_13_a
Hahaha. Yui wouldn't have a cute
costume without you, though.
They look pretty thrilled!
Leafa
400701201_12_a
There they go again, being the
most insufferable parents ever...
Liz
400701201_9_a
Sinon
400701201_11_a
Leafa
400701201_10_a
Oh, okay!
Here, have all you want! And you
can STILL play tricks on me!
Kirito
400701201_8_a
You should give me candy too,
Daddy!
Yui
400701201_7_a
Look over here, Yui!
This'll make a great screenshot!
Kirito
400701201_6_a
Yui is so cute!
TOO cute!
Asuna
400701201_5_a
Give me something good to eat!
If you don't, I'll play a trick on
you!
Yui
400701201_4_a
Kirito
400701201_3_a
Asuna
400701201_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
Trick or treat, trick or treat!
Yui
400701201_1_a
I'm with you there!
Asuna
400701101_24_a
Now let's not keep Yui waiting.
We've got 10 more pieces of candy
to collect!
Kirito
400701101_23_a
Yeah, Kirito's right!
Silica
400701101_22_a
I doubt it. The beauty of VRMMOs
is that any number of strategies
could work.
Kirito
400701101_21_a
Maybe...
Asuna
400701101_20_a
Maybe the admins designed that
boss so you'd need an army to
kill it.
Leafa
400701101_19_a
So our strategy paid off, then!
Leafa
400701101_18_a
Hehe, you're probably right!
Silica
400701101_17_a
Haha, yeah, but I'll bet the
admins didn't count on such a huge
army taking down that boss!
Yuuki
400701101_16_a
And it turns out recruiting all
those people wasn't a waste
of time either.
Kirito
400701101_15_a
It must. Looks like this quest
requires brute strength after all.
Kirito
400701101_14_a
Does that mean no one else
has defeated that witch yet?
Asuna
400701101_13_a
Wait, this is weird.
All the parties in the lead are
stuck at 90...
Leafa
400701101_12_a
someone would've finished by now
if this were any other Event
Quest.
Kirito
400701101_11_a
I can't shake the feeling that
although we're making great
progress,
Kirito
400701101_10_a
Why's that?
Silica
400701101_9_a
Really? That's exciting,
but it also makes me nervous...
Kirito
400701101_8_a
We've still got a shot at being
number one!
Leafa
400701101_7_a
Woohoo!
Nobody's finished it yet!
Leafa
400701101_6_a
Let me just see how everyone else
is doing one more time...
Leafa
400701101_5_a
Great job, team!
Now all we've gotta do is collect
10 more candies, yeah?
Liz
400701101_4_a
Leafa
400701101_3_a
Liz
400701101_2_a
bg_event_halloween_castle
Aw yeah! That boss is doooown!
Kirito
400701101_1_a
Now you're talking!
Leafa
400701001_24_a
And if we beat this thing,
we'll be even closer to finishing
the quest! Let's do this!
Asuna
400701001_23_a
Hats off to the admins here!
Kirito
400701001_22_a
Yeah, I never expected to see a
boss at the end of a collection
quest like this!
Kirito
400701001_21_a
Hehe, finally! This is more my
speed.
Sinon
400701001_20_a
I think that's a pretty safe bet!
Leafa
400701001_19_a
Is this some sort of plot twist
that happens just before you get
100 candies?
Silica
400701001_18_a
Is this the big, bad Halloween
monster or something?
Kirito
400701001_17_a
You might think Halloween is all
fun and games, fairies...
But you're wrong!
???
400701001_16_a
Pests...
Come to "take back what's been
stolen," have you!
???
400701001_15_a
What the hell is that thing?!
Kirito
400701001_14_a
What's the matter, Yuu-whoa!
Silica
400701001_13_a
Huh?
Yuuki
400701001_12_a
Right!
Yuuki
400701001_11_a
Thanks for all your help, Yuuki.
We've got 10 more to go.
We can't get complacent now!
Asuna
400701001_10_a
I'm glad I was able to help too!
Yuuki
400701001_9_a
Are you kidding? I'm impressed
with all the candy we've collected
with such a small group!
Liz
400701001_8_a
And it's all thanks to Liz and
the gang's crowd sourcing.
Sinon
400701001_7_a
Wow. If you'd told me we'd end up
on top back when we started,
I wouldn't have believed you!
Kirito
400701001_6_a
Are you kidding?
Kirito
400701001_5_a
Just a sec, I'll double-check...
Nope! None of the other
parties have made it to 100!
Leafa
400701001_4_a
Perfect! Just 10 more to go!
Asuna
400701001_3_a
Asuna
400701001_2_a
bg_event_halloween_castle
Another one dropped!
That's number 90!
Kirito
400701001_1_a
Yeah!
Silica
400700901_19_a
Look at it this way-we can see
the light at the end of the
tunnel! We're so close!
Leafa
400700901_18_a
Ah, ha ha...
Leafa
400700901_17_a
Getting lumped in with Kirito is
small comfort...
Sinon
400700901_16_a
Sure...
Kirito
400700901_15_a
You're both the muscle! You really
carried us through those fights.
Asuna
400700901_14_a
Ah, um, hehe...
Kirito, Sinon, cheer up!
You guys, um...you helped! Yeah...
Asuna
400700901_13_a
...
Kirito
400700901_12_a
...
Sinon
400700901_11_a
As you'd expect from the former
vice commander of the most
powerful guild ever!
Liz
400700901_10_a
Don't sell yourself short!
You really know how to break
things down for people.
Leafa
400700901_9_a
We're pulling people in like
crazy thanks to Liz, Silica, and
Leafa's expert negotiating skills.
Asuna
400700901_8_a
And the tough guild guys I brought
on agreed to add their 12 pieces.
They were falling behind.
Liz
400700901_7_a
Yes! That last party that joined
us added their 10 candies to the
pot!
Silica
400700901_6_a
Looks like we're up to...
Whoa, 85! We're almost there!
Kirito
400700901_5_a
Yeah, especially now that we have
a few more players giving us their
candy.
Asuna
400700901_4_a
Kirito
400700901_3_a
Asuna
400700901_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
We should have a fair amount now,
no?
Sinon
400700901_1_a
And let you have all the fun?
Hah! We'll ALL negotiate!
Leafa
400700801_18_a
Leave all the negotiating to me!
Kirito
400700801_17_a
But once we do, we should be able
to convince them to give us
their candy!
Leafa
400700801_16_a
It's just a matter of finding
them.
Leafa
400700801_15_a
Yeah! We can't be the only ones
with our backs up against the wall
who don't want to give up!
Leafa
400700801_14_a
Let's keep an eye out for anyone
else who might want to join us
while we're out collecting candy.
Asuna
400700801_13_a
We'll have to attack this head-on.
Asuna
400700801_12_a
Right. Halloween doesn't last
forever! We've gotta hustle.
Kirito
400700801_11_a
But now that we're back on track,
it's time to turn on the jets.
Sinon
400700801_10_a
Looks like a total of...57!
Wow, we're over halfway already!
Leafa
400700801_9_a
Alright! How many do we have now
that Yuuki's crew added their
candy?
Liz
400700801_8_a
You got it.
Kirito
400700801_7_a
It's all good.
Besides, I've got the time.
So put me in your party already!
Yuuki
400700801_6_a
Thanks, Yuuki.
Asuna
400700801_5_a
When we all talked about it,
we all agreed that opening the
shop back up is all that matters.
Yuuki
400700801_4_a
Not at all!
The rest of the Sleeping Knights
are busy with other stuff...
Yuuki
400700801_3_a
Yuuki
400700801_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
You're sure you don't mind, Yuuki?
Kirito
400700801_1_a
Still a ways to go, eh?
Liz
400700701_18_a
22...
Kirito
400700701_17_a
By the way, how many do we have
now?
Leafa
400700701_16_a
I think we'll just have to collect
all the candies ourselves.
Silica
400700701_15_a
It isn't that easy to team up
with total strangers for a
quest.
Asuna
400700701_14_a
This isn't like SAO, where we
had to put together a party for
a boss raid.
Asuna
400700701_13_a
Seems that way.
Asuna
400700701_12_a
Everyone wants to complete the
quest on their own merits.
Sinon
400700701_11_a
Whatever the circumstances,
chasing these temporary alliances
isn't getting us anywhere.
Sinon
400700701_10_a
I've never seen you so dejected
before. This is new territory.
Liz
400700701_9_a
Haha, sorry. I can't help myself.
Liz
400700701_8_a
Could you NOT narrate everything
I do like we're in some sort of
novel?
Kirito
400700701_7_a
Kirito's shoulders slumped as
another player refused his offer.
Would he be a solo player forever?
Liz
400700701_6_a
...
Kirito
400700701_5_a
I mean, it's not really cheating.
But okay, yeah, I get it...
Kirito
400700701_4_a
Do it yourselves if you're having
so much fun. I'm not gonna help
you cheat!
Player A
400700701_3_a
Kirito
400700701_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
What? No way!
Player A
400700701_1_a
This just might work.
Let me think for a second.
Leafa
400700601_35_a
So all we have to do is find some
players who want to check out the
event or shop at that shop?
Leafa
400700601_34_a
Luckily we don't have any
of those! Do we...?
Kirito
400700601_33_a
That's totally unfair, though!
What about all the introverts who
hate large groups?
Liz
400700601_32_a
Yeah. As long as players don't
mind large groups, it shouldn't
be a big deal.
Kirito
400700601_31_a
I see what you mean.
A bunch of parties could merge
and complete the quest faster.
Asuna
400700601_30_a
So why wouldn't you be able to
pool your resources?
Kirito
400700601_29_a
This event is open to anyone,
right?
Kirito
400700601_28_a
Think about it. This isn't a
ranked quest, and it's on a
temporary map.
Kirito
400700601_27_a
But...why would they do that?
Silica
400700601_26_a
So it's all based on an honor
system. Which means nobody HAS to
fight. We can just exchange candy.
Kirito
400700601_25_a
Otherwise, they can just run away
if they lose and leave the
winning players in a lurch!
Asuna
400700601_24_a
This is a problem, though!
The system should be patched so
they have to honor the bet.
Asuna
400700601_23_a
They came after us, though.
I guess we got too caught up in
fighting them off.
Leafa
400700601_22_a
Argh. Joke's on us, then.
Leafa
400700601_21_a
They broke their promise while we
were distracted!
Liz
400700601_20_a
Ahh! They got away!
Liz
400700601_19_a
Oh crap! I forgot!
Kirito
400700601_18_a
Wait, didn't we just get some from
the players we beat in that PvP
fight?
Leafa
400700601_17_a
We've got 17.
That's way more than we had
earlier.
Kirito
400700601_16_a
We're collecting candy much faster
thanks to you guys! Let's see how
many we have now...
Asuna
400700601_15_a
That's not true at all!
Asuna
400700601_14_a
Well, adding more people to our
party certainly hasn't moved
the needle on our candy stash.
Sinon
400700601_13_a
Not personally, no. But players
who value efficiency might think
otherwise, given the drop rate.
Leafa
400700601_12_a
Are you saying stealing from other
players is fun?
Silica
400700601_11_a
Combine that with a low drop rate
and you've got a recipe for some
serious theft.
Leafa
400700601_10_a
Well, how else are people supposed
to play? ALO encourages PvP stuff.
Leafa
400700601_9_a
I think you're exaggerating a
little, Asuna.
Liz
400700601_8_a
Me neither! What's worse is that
I hear it's a frequent occurrence.
Asuna
400700601_7_a
Hmph... I can't believe people
are actually trying to steal
other players' candy.
Kirito
400700601_6_a
Alright.
Kirito
400700601_5_a
Liz
400700601_4_a
Asuna
400700601_3_a
Kirito
400700601_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Oh man, we're in trouble now!
Okay, you win!
Give us a break, will ya?
Salamander A
400700601_1_a
Yeah!
Silica
400700501_24_a
Alright then, let's get back to
giving Yui the best Halloween
EVER!
Leafa
400700501_23_a
See? Sinon gets it.
Kirito
400700501_22_a
He's got a point.
I'm always willing to see how far
I can push myself.
Sinon
400700501_21_a
I know that, but we might as well
aim high anyway!
Kirito
400700501_20_a
Yeah, there's no need to rush.
Liz
400700501_19_a
But this isn't a ranked quest,
my love.
Asuna
400700501_18_a
Oh Kirito! Ever the optimist!
Hahaha!
Asuna
400700501_17_a
But if that's the score to beat,
then nobody's completed it yet.
We can still turn this around!
Kirito
400700501_16_a
You mean they've already got 50
or more?! That's crazy.
Leafa
400700501_15_a
Every party's in a different spot,
but I've heard some are already
halfway done.
Sinon
400700501_14_a
Man, only four pieces...
We've got our work cut out for us!
Liz
400700501_13_a
Here, let me add you now...
Lisbeth, Sinon, and Silica...
And...invite sent!
Kirito
400700501_12_a
Yeah. I really appreciate that!
Kirito
400700501_11_a
We can join your party even
after the quest's started, right?
Sinon
400700501_10_a
Isn't that why you called?
Sinon
400700501_9_a
You really do need a big group
for this quest...
Leafa
400700501_8_a
Hahaha! Wow...
Leafa
400700501_7_a
Oh man, that's nothing!
Liz
400700501_6_a
We, uh, only have four pieces...
Asuna
400700501_5_a
How much candy have you
collected, Kirito?
Silica
400700501_4_a
Hope you weren't waiting long.
Sinon
400700501_3_a
Hey, it's Liz and the others.
Kirito
400700501_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Kiritoooo! Asunaaaa!
Liz
400700501_1_a
Don't mention it.
Yuuki
400700401_23_a
Yeah, of course.
Thanks for the tip!
Kirito
400700401_22_a
But you've got good instincts.
We're not gonna steal from you,
but others might try.
Yuuki
400700401_21_a
Hehe, my bad.
Yuuki
400700401_20_a
Phew...
Don't scare us like that, Yuuki!
Asuna
400700401_19_a
We're just doing this event for
kicks!
Yuuki
400700401_18_a
Hah! Oh relax, I'm not gonna fight
you!
Yuuki
400700401_17_a
Wait...!
Kirito
400700401_16_a
Of course, it helps to set some
ground rules. Like betting candy
on a duel, or something.
Yuuki
400700401_15_a
Hehe, yep...
You can steal candy from other
players! It's a free-for-all!
Yuuki
400700401_14_a
So you're saying...
Leafa
400700401_13_a
so I've heard that parties can
share the candy they pick up.
Yuuki
400700401_12_a
Part of the scenario for this
quest takes place on an instance
map,
Yuuki
400700401_11_a
Oh, and by the way...
Yuuki
400700401_10_a
Maybe we should've gotten a few
more people together first...
Kirito
400700401_9_a
Yeah, there's definitely strength
in numbers...
Asuna
400700401_8_a
so the more the merrier!
Yuuki
400700401_7_a
Parties can tackle this quest,
Yuuki
400700401_6_a
Yeah! The rest of the Sleeping
Knights are right behind me.
Yuuki
400700401_5_a
Yuuki, are you trying to complete
the Halloween quest too?
Kirito
400700401_4_a
Kirito
400700401_3_a
Oh, hey, Yuuki!
Asuna
400700401_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Yoooo, Asuna!
Yuuki
400700401_1_a
Yeah, the only way out of this is
through all those monsters!
Leafa
400700301_19_a
You're right.
Well, we'd better get busy!
Asuna
400700301_18_a
Tell me about it. But we've got to
do the best we can.
For Yui's sake.
Kirito
400700301_17_a
Just getting one was hard enough!
Hahaha, looks like we've got a
ways to go, then!
Asuna
400700301_16_a
Geez! Why do we need so many?!
Leafa
400700301_15_a
It says we need...100 pieces...
Kirito
400700301_14_a
How many are there?
Leafa
400700301_13_a
What is it, Kirito?!
Asuna
400700301_12_a
Hang on, WHAT?!
Kirito
400700301_11_a
But to complete the quest,
you've got to collect them all...
Kirito
400700301_10_a
It says, "You've taken one piece
of candy back..."
Kirito
400700301_9_a
Let's see here...
Kirito
400700301_8_a
Uh...
I got some more information when
I put the candy in my inventory.
Kirito
400700301_7_a
Do we get more candy if we keep
fighting the monsters?
Asuna
400700301_6_a
Are you sure that's enough?
The monsters are still spawning...
Leafa
400700301_5_a
Now all we have to do is give some
to one of the NPC children, right?
Asuna
400700301_4_a
Leafa
400700301_3_a
Asuna
400700301_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Alright, we got the shop's candy
back!
Kirito
400700301_1_a
Leave everything to us, Yui!
Asuna
400700201_25_a
Let's go, everybody!
Yui
400700201_24_a
No problem!
Leafa
400700201_23_a
You're right about that.
Care to give us a hand, Leafa?
Kirito
400700201_22_a
Yui won't get to experience
Halloween if we don't!
Asuna
400700201_21_a
Well then, we'd better take care
of this quest!
Asuna
400700201_20_a
That seems to be the case.
Asuna
400700201_19_a
It sounds like the premise is that
the monsters stole all the candy
from this shop.
Kirito
400700201_18_a
And it looks like the candy you
have to give them was what this
shop sold.
Kirito
400700201_17_a
And you get a reward if you give
candy to the NPC children.
Yui
400700201_16_a
You get candy if you defeat the
event-exclusive monster that's
on the special Halloween map!
Yui
400700201_15_a
Aha! It must be this event,
Mommy. I looked it up.
Yui
400700201_14_a
Wait, really?! But why...?
Asuna
400700201_13_a
I heard that shop stopped selling
candy now that this event's been
triggered...
Leafa
400700201_12_a
Oh, actually...
Leafa
400700201_11_a
Kirito, we told Yui we'd get
Halloween candy. Remember?
Asuna
400700201_10_a
Oh yeah?
What kind of quest is it?
Kirito
400700201_9_a
But there's a new quest that
just got unlocked. That's really
why I'm here.
Leafa
400700201_8_a
Oh, come on, you know me better
than that! I actually wanted to
try dressing up for Halloween...
Leafa
400700201_7_a
They're selling Halloween candy at
this shop, aren't they? Or have
you just come to play a trick?
Kirito
400700201_6_a
Hello, Leafa!
Yui
400700201_5_a
Oh, you've got Asuna and Yui with
you! Hey guys!
Leafa
400700201_4_a
Hi, Leafa!
Asuna
400700201_3_a
What's up, Sugu?
What're you doing here?
Kirito
400700201_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
Hey, big bro!
Leafa
400700201_1_a
Yay! Thank you, Mommy!
Yui
400700101_14_a
Sounds like a plan!
Kirito
400700101_13_a
Of course we can do Halloween
stuff, sweetie! We'll go shopping
for Halloween candy later.
Asuna
400700101_12_a
Now that I think about it, we've
never celebrated Halloween with
Yui before.
Kirito
400700101_11_a
I wanna do Halloween stuff too!
Yui
400700101_10_a
Fairy children asking for candy!
They're really going all-out for
this Halloween event.
Asuna
400700101_9_a
It really is!
Asuna
400700101_8_a
Hahaha, that's adorable.
Kirito
400700101_7_a
Gimme something good to eat!
NPC Child
400700101_6_a
Trick or treat, trick or treat!
NPC Child
400700101_5_a
Yui
400700101_4_a
Asuna
400700101_3_a
Kirito
400700101_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
Halloween! It's Halloween! Yay!
NPC Child
400700101_1_a
Well, duh!
Leafa
400601301_24_a
Okay, Mommy!
Yui
400601301_23_a
Oh, I know.
Kirito
400601301_22_a
That goes for you guys as well,
Kirito, Leafa, and Yui.
Asuna
400601301_21_a
Thank you. I hope you'll all
continue to show me the ropes.
Asuna
400601301_20_a
That sounds like the Asuna I know.
Kirito
400601301_19_a
Going forward, I want to create
a style that makes use of all my
skills.
Asuna
400601301_18_a
And I'm speaking for myself as
a swordswoman and SAO survivor,
not just an Undine.
Asuna
400601301_17_a
Thank you all for saying so.
I think I'm getting the hang of
things, little by little.
Asuna
400601301_16_a
Yeah! Mommy did a great job in
that battle!
Yui
400601301_15_a
Not only that, but Asuna proved
that she's really getting used to
ALO!
Leafa
400601301_14_a
Oh yeah, we did!
Kirito
400601301_13_a
We all agreed we'd pitch in for
a little celebration dinner once
we crushed the Guardians, no?
Alicia
400601301_12_a
Okay, so now that the formalities
are out of the way...
Alicia
400601301_11_a
Hehe, you're being far too kind,
Asuna. We're just glad we could
help.
Sakuya
400601301_10_a
I've put a lot on your shoulders,
and I thank you from the bottom of
my heart for bearing the load.
Asuna
400601301_9_a
You've really shown me how many
friends I've got, ready to help me
through thick and thin.
Asuna
400601301_8_a
Hey, that's MY line!
Asuna
400601301_7_a
Haha, yeah... Sorry about that.
Kirito
400601301_6_a
It sure does! Last time was a real
mess once we'd seen Kirito off!
Leafa
400601301_5_a
Oh man, it feels so good to have
finally defeated all the
Guardians!
Alicia
400601301_4_a
Leafa
400601301_3_a
Alicia
400601301_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Thank you all for your valiant
efforts!
Sakuya
400601301_1_a
sniff
Hehe...
Thanks for letting me put all that
out there. It felt good.
Asuna
400601201_23_a
You're very welcome.
Kirito
400601201_22_a
Thank you...
Every last one of you.
Asuna
400601201_21_a
Oh, Asuna...
Leafa
400601201_20_a
I'm just so thankful...
Asuna
400601201_19_a
And you did it all so I could
log out of ALO...
Asuna
400601201_18_a
N-No, Yui, that's not it...
I've just realized the incredible
lengths you've all gone to...
Asuna
400601201_17_a
Are you that happy to have cleared
this quest, Mommy?
Yui
400601201_16_a
Hey now, there's no reason to cry.
Kirito
400601201_15_a
sniff
... 
sob
Asuna
400601201_14_a
Asuna?
Leafa
400601201_13_a
sniff
Asuna
400601201_12_a
You all went through this tough
battle in order to help me, didn't
you?
Asuna
400601201_11_a
Everything okay, Asuna?
You're staring off into space.
Kirito
400601201_10_a
...
Asuna
400601201_9_a
All's well that ends well, though!
Nice job, everybody!
Alicia
400601201_8_a
Well, would you look at that...
It was exactly as difficult as I
imagined it would be.
Sakuya
400601201_7_a
A summary of the quest appeared
too! You've completed it!
Yui
400601201_6_a
Yay!
Yui
400601201_5_a
Wow... We did it!
Finally!
Leafa
400601201_4_a
Yeah, I think that's all of them.
Kirito
400601201_3_a
Kirito
400601201_2_a
bg_22_grand_quest
Did we... Did we get them all?
Asuna
400601201_1_a
Yeah, we've got a score to settle
with these Guardians. Here goes
nothing!
Leafa
400601101_25_a
Alright then, let's get to it!
Kirito
400601101_24_a
Thank you so much!
Asuna
400601101_23_a
so I think she's earned a spot on
the front lines.
Alicia
400601101_22_a
Asuna showed us how tough Undines
can be by helping us get this far,
Alicia
400601101_21_a
Me too!
Alicia
400601101_20_a
I concur with that.
Sakuya
400601101_19_a
Aw, Asuna...
Leafa
400601101_18_a
I can't stand the idea of just
standing here and being support.
Asuna
400601101_17_a
Not to mention you've all done so
much to get us to this point...
Asuna
400601101_16_a
But as an Undine, I think I have
the means to hold my own in
combat too.
Asuna
400601101_15_a
Of course, I can provide healing
and buff support, and maybe that's
the best use of my abilities.
Asuna
400601101_14_a
Are you sure about that, Asuna?
Kirito
400601101_13_a
but I'd like to be on the front
lines if possible.
Asuna
400601101_12_a
Forgive me if this sounds selfish,
Asuna
400601101_11_a
Ah, may I...?
Asuna
400601101_10_a
Yes, I think that would be wise.
Sakuya
400601101_9_a
Maybe we should have Asuna on rear
guard support?
Alicia
400601101_8_a
Well, we do have a lot of melee
fighters in our party, that's for
sure.
Alicia
400601101_7_a
Well, it would collapse into a
giant free-for-all.
Sakuya
400601101_6_a
But against their numbers,
I have to think that any strategy
we come up with will just...
Sakuya
400601101_5_a
I think it'd be best to split them
up and take them out in groups.
Kirito
400601101_4_a
Assuming they haven't changed,
they'll be easy to distinguish.
Kirito
400601101_3_a
Kirito
400601101_2_a
bg_22_grand_quest_door
You should know that there are two
types of Guardians, though.
Short and long-range.
Leafa
400601101_1_a
Y-Yeah, okay. That makes me feel
a little bit better.
Asuna
400601001_18_a
Yeah, we should just be able to
play normally this time-no crazy
strategies required.
Alicia
400601001_17_a
She's right. It shouldn't be
anywhere near as difficult this
time around.
Sakuya
400601001_16_a
But Daddy, the admins had
intentionally made it impossible
to complete back then.
Yui
400601001_15_a
I don't think I was SUPPOSED to do
it that way, but it worked.
Kirito
400601001_14_a
I let Leafa and the others handle
the endlessly spawning Guardians
and forced my way to the top.
Kirito
400601001_13_a
So, what did you do last time?
Asuna
400601001_12_a
I would've run out of HP before
they stopped spawning.
Kirito
400601001_11_a
There probably IS a limit, but I
couldn't hold out long enough to
find it last time.
Kirito
400601001_10_a
Infinitely?!
Asuna
400601001_9_a
They're pretty strong, but what's
scarier to me is how they just
keep spawning infinitely.
Leafa
400601001_8_a
I think I'm the only one in this
party who hasn't seen one before,
so...
Asuna
400601001_7_a
Do you, um, have any tips on how
to defeat the Guardians? Is there
a strategy to it?
Asuna
400601001_6_a
...
Asuna
400601001_5_a
Youuuu got it!
We've gotta defeat the Guardians
inside the World Tree.
Alicia
400601001_4_a
Which means the next objective is-
Kirito
400601001_3_a
Kirito
400601001_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Okay, that should be the last of
them.
Sakuya
400601001_1_a
Kirito
400600901_27_a
Yui
400600901_26_a
Coming!
Asuna
400600901_25_a
Over here!
Alicia
400600901_24_a
We're almost to the next trigger!
Leafa
400600901_23_a
Alicia
400600901_22_a
Leafa
400600901_21_a
Look, everybody!
Sakuya
400600901_20_a
Thank you, Yui.
Asuna
400600901_19_a
Then I'm gonna do my best to show
you around, so Mommy can enjoy
herself!
Yui
400600901_18_a
Good!
Asuna
400600901_17_a
Well then, that's what we'll do.
Kirito
400600901_16_a
Aw, Asuna...
Kirito
400600901_15_a
I just want to enjoy it all with
you by my side.
Asuna
400600901_14_a
I'm not going to let that stop me
from enjoying a game world this
gorgeous.
Asuna
400600901_13_a
Sometimes I definitely get
flashbacks, but...
Asuna
400600901_12_a
No, I'm fine. It's just a VRMMO.
Just a game that we're playing
for fun.
Asuna
400600901_11_a
Are you sure you're okay?
We don't have to keep going if-
Kirito
400600901_10_a
Kirito...
Asuna
400600901_9_a
We certainly take that more
personally than most,
being SAO survivors.
Kirito
400600901_8_a
I thought so...
Kirito
400600901_7_a
Mm-hm...
Yui
400600901_6_a
Are you upset because she talked
about the Salamanders wanting
to kill us?
Kirito
400600901_5_a
Yeah, I'm fine, Yui. What's wrong?
Asuna
400600901_4_a
Kirito
400600901_3_a
Asuna
400600901_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Are you okay, Mommy?
Yui
400600901_1_a
...
Kirito
400600801_23_a
I-I guess so...
Asuna
400600801_22_a
Hehehe, you're a sensitive one,
aren't you, Asuna?
Alicia
400600801_21_a
have a gigantic target painted
on their back.
Sakuya
400600801_20_a
From their perspective, a rival
leader lost deep in enemy
territory might as well
Sakuya
400600801_19_a
She's not wrong, though.
ALO is a PvP game, after all.
Sakuya
400600801_18_a
Asuna... It's okay.
Kirito
400600801_17_a
They didn't even try to hide it.
That's pretty terrifying.
Asuna
400600801_16_a
I mean, they really looked ready
to kill us...
Asuna
400600801_15_a
Scary? In what way?
Leafa
400600801_14_a
They were a little scary though...
Asuna
400600801_13_a
Indeed.
Sakuya
400600801_12_a
So we'll just treat that as a
hiccup then.
Leafa
400600801_11_a
Haha, yeah, you're probably right.
Kirito
400600801_10_a
Seriously. Either that or they
grossly underestimated the army
they'd need to take us down!
Alicia
400600801_9_a
If they had heard of our plans,
they would have sent more men.
Sakuya
400600801_8_a
No, it didn't seem like it.
We just happened to cross paths.
Sakuya
400600801_7_a
Did they know we were coming?
Kirito
400600801_6_a
Yeah, it was a bit disappointing
really.
Alicia
400600801_5_a
That we did. They didn't even
give us much of a fight to
speak of.
Sakuya
400600801_4_a
Alicia
400600801_3_a
Sakuya
400600801_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
We took care of them.
Asuna
400600801_1_a
Got it!
Asuna
400600701_35_a
Right there with you!
Kirito
400600701_34_a
Asuna, back us up, okay?
Here goes, Kirito!
Leafa
400600701_33_a
Asuna
400600701_32_a
Kirito
400600701_31_a
Sakuya and Alicia, just keep an
eye on your HP!
Leafa
400600701_30_a
Hell yeah! Let's go!
Salamander A
400600701_29_a
Alicia
400600701_28_a
Sakuya
400600701_27_a
Kirito
400600701_26_a
Aw man, we'll be heroes if we kill
those leaders!
Salamander B
400600701_25_a
Yeah, we prepared for a little bit
of danger.
Alicia
400600701_24_a
It's an assumed risk.
Sakuya
400600701_23_a
Alicia
400600701_22_a
Sakuya
400600701_21_a
Fancy meeting them here...
Kirito
400600701_20_a
Hey, hold up...
I think I see some leaders!
Salamander A
400600701_19_a
Sakuya
400600701_18_a
Oh...
Asuna
400600701_17_a
Sylphs have the best hearing
of all the races, Mommy.
That's probably why.
Yui
400600701_16_a
What?! I can't hear a thing...
Asuna
400600701_15_a
Yeah...
Leafa
400600701_14_a
Wait. Someone's coming.
Sakuya
400600701_13_a
I see...
Asuna
400600701_12_a
I can vouch for that. As long as
you only told him, word won't
get out.
Kirito
400600701_11_a
Eugene, at the very least, doesn't
engage in underhanded tactics.
Alicia
400600701_10_a
Besides, most Salamanders are
pretty gross, but I'll say this...
Alicia
400600701_9_a
Yeah, but we didn't tell him what
day this was happening, so he's
not going to be ready for us.
Alicia
400600701_8_a
But didn't you say you invited
the Salamander general?
Asuna
400600701_7_a
We needn't be on high alert.
Nobody knows about this,
and there isn't a guard in sight.
Sakuya
400600701_6_a
She's right.
Don't let your guard down.
Leafa
400600701_5_a
Yes. We're approaching
Salamander territory.
Yui
400600701_4_a
Leafa
400600701_3_a
Yui
400600701_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
I think this is the area.
Kirito
400600701_1_a
Hehe, I suppose so.
Asuna
400600601_25_a
Spoken like a true fairy.
Sometimes you've just gotta
stretch your wings, right?
Alicia
400600601_24_a
Is that how you see us? Personally
the fairy tale princess life would
get me down, so I take excursions.
Sakuya
400600601_23_a
They lock themselves away like
so many fairy tale princesses
locked in towers.
Leafa
400600601_22_a
Which is why most leaders tend
not to leave their territories.
Leafa
400600601_21_a
I see... From your perspective,
that's a pretty massive loss.
Asuna
400600601_20_a
You get to take a third of their
money and change the territory's
taxes at will for 10 days.
Leafa
400600601_19_a
Not to mention you get all sorts
of bonuses when you kill a leader.
Leafa
400600601_18_a
Indeed it was.
Sakuya
400600601_17_a
This was the leader before Sakuya.
It was a hotly contested
territory, even then.
Alicia
400600601_16_a
For what? It had nothing to do
with you.
Sakuya
400600601_15_a
Really? Oh my gosh, I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
Asuna
400600601_14_a
that is now controlled by the
Sylphs was killed by the
Salamanders.
Yui
400600601_13_a
No, Mommy. It seems that once
in the past, the leader of the
territory
Yui
400600601_12_a
Does another race get to take
their territory?
Asuna
400600601_11_a
What happens if a leader does
get killed?
Asuna
400600601_10_a
I'm sorry, Sakuya.
Alicia
400600601_9_a
The risk of getting killed is too
great.
Sakuya
400600601_8_a
Indeed. There's no rule saying we
can't leave, but most don't.
Sakuya
400600601_7_a
Am I correct in remembering that
leaders tend not to leave their
territory?
Asuna
400600601_6_a
I'm just glad I could help.
Asuna
400600601_5_a
I know. And Asuna's healing
magic saved me.
Sakuya
400600601_4_a
Just be careful, Sakuya.
You're a leader, you know.
Leafa
400600601_3_a
Leafa
400600601_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Phew... That got a bit too close
for comfort. What a powerful
enemy.
Sakuya
400600601_1_a
Ahaha! Classic Eugene.
Leafa
400600501_14_a
I heard Eugene is also top-ranked,
but of course he refused
to join us.
Sakuya
400600501_13_a
Well, that was NEVER going to work.
The other races are always
fighting each other.
Alicia
400600501_12_a
I mentioned this to the other
leaders at a meeting, but got
no response.
Sakuya
400600501_11_a
Uh, no, I didn't...
Leafa
400600501_10_a
Did you reach out to anyone else?
Kirito
400600501_9_a
But if I'm being totally honest,
I wish we had a few more
people.
Leafa
400600501_8_a
That's comforting to hear.
Thank you.
Asuna
400600501_7_a
Me too.
Kirito
400600501_6_a
Yeah. I keep forgetting you've
only played for a few days!
Alicia
400600501_5_a
Nonsense, Asuna.
You're doing just fine.
Sakuya
400600501_4_a
I-I'm going to be dead weight,
aren't I?
Asuna
400600501_3_a
Asuna
400600501_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Well, if players have to be
selected, the enemy must be pretty
tough.
Leafa
400600501_1_a
Good point.
Asuna
400600401_24_a
Yeah, that makes sense.
Kirito
400600401_23_a
Cardinal may have also
automatically made some selections.
Yui
400600401_22_a
Huh. Okay...
Kirito
400600401_21_a
and a dash of subjectivity.
Probably whoever made the biggest
impression on the admins.
Alicia
400600401_20_a
Sure does! Which is why I bet this
time, ranks were assigned based on
raw power...
Alicia
400600401_19_a
Does that make sense?
Yui
400600401_18_a
It's hard to assign a rank that
takes all of those into account.
Yui
400600401_17_a
There are so many factors:
skill level, achievements,
number of items...
Yui
400600401_16_a
ALO's lack of a level system makes
it difficult to accurately gauge
player ability.
Yui
400600401_15_a
I haven't played THAT much...
Kirito
400600401_14_a
Not to mention a Spriggan with an
almost legendary amount of play
time logged, so he's a shoo-in.
Alicia
400600401_13_a
So let's see. We've got two
leaders, and Leafa's one of the
Top 5 Sylphs...
Alicia
400600401_12_a
To some extent, it's got to be
based on the player's skill.
Alicia
400600401_11_a
Is it random?
Kirito
400600401_10_a
Yeah, I got that. But who gets
that little wing, and how?
Kirito
400600401_9_a
I'm sorry, were we talking to
a different Kirito? We told you,
there's a little wing-
Leafa
400600401_8_a
Hang on a second. How do they
determine which players are
top-ranked?
Kirito
400600401_7_a
Got it.
Asuna
400600401_6_a
To do that, we'll have to trigger
a couple of different things.
Sakuya
400600401_5_a
we'll have to break its seal.
Sakuya
400600401_4_a
Correct. In order to get inside
The World Tree,
Sakuya
400600401_3_a
Sakuya
400600401_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
But we need a plan.
We can't just charge in through
the front door, as it were.
Asuna
400600401_1_a
So it is.
Kirito
400600301_24_a
Well then, the crew's assembled!
Alicia
400600301_23_a
Of course!
Sakuya
400600301_22_a
That you're okay with me going
on this quest.
Asuna
400600301_21_a
But before we go, I just want to
be absolutely sure...
Asuna
400600301_20_a
That's really sweet of you.
Thank you. I'm so glad you
thought of me.
Asuna
400600301_19_a
Oh, Leafa...
Asuna
400600301_18_a
So we invited you along.
Leafa
400600301_17_a
And that you might want to face
down some demons in the process.
Leafa
400600301_16_a
We...also thought you might be
able to show us the way, even if
you couldn't help us fight...
Leafa
400600301_15_a
We didn't think it would be right
to do this mission without at
least telling you.
Leafa
400600301_14_a
Yes.
Leafa
400600301_13_a
The inner route that goes to the
top of the tree...?
Asuna
400600301_12_a
You've gotta be kidding me!
Kirito
400600301_11_a
Which means we need to retrace
the path you took when we helped
you escape.
Leafa
400600301_10_a
Our objective is to defeat the
Guardians of The World Tree.
Leafa
400600301_9_a
You...what?
Asuna
400600301_8_a
This one's on me. I suggested that
you be invited on this quest.
Leafa
400600301_7_a
I haven't spent that long in ALO.
Are you sure I should accept a
quest like this?
Asuna
400600301_6_a
Which is another way of saying
this quest is really difficult,
right?
Asuna
400600301_5_a
We needed AT LEAST four top-ranked
players. We're allowed to have
more.
Alicia
400600301_4_a
Asuna
400600301_3_a
Alicia
400600301_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
But I still don't see the big
picture. Why invite Asuna too if
you only needed me?
Kirito
400600301_1_a
Huh... Okay, I follow so far...
Kirito
400600201_14_a
Leafa told us you had the same
icon, so we decided to approach
you.
Sakuya
400600201_13_a
That's what you need to have in
order to go on this quest.
Alicia
400600201_12_a
Yeah... What about it?
Kirito
400600201_11_a
Very perceptive. Do you see the
little wing icon in the bottom-
right of your status window?
Sakuya
400600201_10_a
They're usually pretty precise
when it comes to rankings.
Kirito
400600201_9_a
Points? Quest completion rankings?
Kirito
400600201_8_a
Wait a minute.
What kind of ranking are we
using here?
Kirito
400600201_7_a
Alicia, Leafa, myself, and you,
Kirito.
Sakuya
400600201_6_a
And now that you're here,
our search is complete.
This makes four.
Sakuya
400600201_5_a
Yep yep!
Alicia
400600201_4_a
Sakuya
400600201_3_a
Alicia
400600201_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
So you need people above a
certain ranking?
Kirito
400600201_1_a
but it turns out we need at least
four top-ranked players.
Sakuya
400600101_13_a
I'll field this one. We were
gathering some people together
for a quest,
Sakuya
400600101_12_a
What kind of quest...?
Kirito
400600101_11_a
We just want to talk about a
quest, that's all.
Leafa
400600101_10_a
Haha, it's okay, Yui! Relax.
Leafa
400600101_9_a
Both leaders are here... What in
the world's going to happen?
Yui
400600101_8_a
H-Hi. How are you?
Asuna
400600101_7_a
Whoa! Er, hey, Sakuya.
Hi Alicia.
Kirito
400600101_6_a
Heya, Kirito!
Long time no see.
Alicia
400600101_5_a
Alicia
400600101_4_a
Hello, Kirito.
Sakuya
400600101_3_a
Hi Leafa. So...why'd you want to
meet in a place like this?
Kirito
400600101_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Hey, Kirito! Asuna!
Leafa
400600101_1_a
Exactly.
Kirito
400501201_23_a
Got it. We don't want history to
repeat itself.
Leafa
400501201_22_a
Good. I'll leave that to you two.
And nobody breathe a word
of this to anyone else.
Kirito
400501201_21_a
Okay. I'll go tell Alicia what
happened.
Silica
400501201_20_a
Yeah. We should report back to
Sakuya.
Leafa
400501201_19_a
Well then, that takes care of this
quest.
Asuna
400501201_18_a
Yeah, you're probably right.
Yuuki
400501201_17_a
We should leave them be.
Kirito
400501201_16_a
Me three, but all the disruptions
to their lifestyle are what caused
this in the first place.
Kirito
400501201_15_a
Me too...
Liz
400501201_14_a
Man, I would've liked to see the
valley exploding with flowers.
Yuuki
400501201_13_a
Exactly.
Leafa
400501201_12_a
But the Butterfly Valley name
stuck. That makes a lot of sense!
Asuna
400501201_11_a
So they decided to only use the
jewel to keep the fog out of the
valley and reduced its power.
Leafa
400501201_10_a
All of whom wanted nothing more
than to be left alone.
They came to resent the crowds.
Silica
400501201_9_a
And as you'll recall, this area
was settled by Sylph and Cait Sith
splinter groups...
Silica
400501201_8_a
...
Kirito
400501201_7_a
But then word of the garden's
beauty got out and tons of
fairies descended upon the valley.
Leafa
400501201_6_a
In time, the valley became a
beautiful flower garden.
Silica
400501201_5_a
They did in fact use the true
power of the Jewel of Serenity to
turn the arid land lush.
Silica
400501201_4_a
And? What did you learn?
Kirito
400501201_3_a
Kirito
400501201_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_sunset
Silica and I talked to the
wind tribe.
Leafa
400501201_1_a
Leafa's got a point.
That'll be much faster.
Asuna
400501101_20_a
Well, let's ask about all that
when we hand over the jewel!
Leafa
400501101_19_a
Well, like I said, this is just a
guess. It might also just be an
internal setting.
Kirito
400501101_18_a
Do you think they used it at full
power in order to make the desert
fertile?
Silica
400501101_17_a
got the name Butterfly Valley.
Kirito
400501101_16_a
I think the jewel's power is the
reason the valley where the wind
tribe settled...
Kirito
400501101_15_a
forcing the jewel to use its
power like that.
Kirito
400501101_14_a
I figured this out once the goblin
leader used it to protect himself
from us,
Kirito
400501101_13_a
How is that possible?
Leafa
400501101_12_a
That's got to be a side effect
of using the jewel at full power.
Kirito
400501101_11_a
Yeah, the lone flower in an
endless desert. It was so
strange...
Asuna
400501101_10_a
Oh yeah, that. Remember the flower
that started growing after the
sandstorm?
Kirito
400501101_9_a
Okay, Kirito. What were you trying
to tell Leafa earlier?
Yuuki
400501101_8_a
You've got that right.
Kirito
400501101_7_a
That was far from an easy fight.
Liz
400501101_6_a
Yay! Now we can take the
Jewel of Serenity back!
Silica
400501101_5_a
Goblin leader down! We did it!
Asuna
400501101_4_a
Silica
400501101_3_a
Asuna
400501101_2_a
bg_event_desert
Blgyaaaaah!
Goblin
400501101_1_a
Okay, let's do this!
Leafa
400501001_15_a
Yeah, good call!
Kirito
400501001_14_a
Hey, guys! Maybe we can talk
about this later!
Yuuki
400501001_13_a
GRAAAAAR!
Goblin
400501001_12_a
And I think I've finally figured
out why.
Kirito
400501001_11_a
but even if they did clear up the
fog, the desert ravine they're in
isn't exactly a butterfly habitat.
Kirito
400501001_10_a
Well, I've been trying to figure
out why they call it Butterfly
Valley. This is just a theory,
Kirito
400501001_9_a
Wait, what makes you say that?
Leafa
400501001_8_a
You're right. They shouldn't be
abusing it, but I'm glad they
tested its limits.
Kirito
400501001_7_a
Stop abusing it!
Silica
400501001_6_a
Y-Yeah! But the Jewel of Serenity
belongs to the wind tribe!
Silica
400501001_5_a
Nice try, tripping us up with
that jewel you stole!
Leafa
400501001_4_a
Grblgraaah!
Goblin
400501001_3_a
Leafa
400501001_2_a
bg_event_desert
Finally, we caught up to them!
Asuna
400501001_1_a
She's right!
Kirito
400500901_15_a
Um, yeah, flowers are great and
all, but we've gotta get after the
thieves before they get too far!
Leafa
400500901_14_a
How did this happen?
Yuuki
400500901_13_a
What the hell...?
Kirito
400500901_12_a
That wasn't here before, right?
I'm not crazy? I mean, it's just
sand as far as the eye can see.
Liz
400500901_11_a
What is it, Liz?
Oh, wow, there's a flower growing
here!
Asuna
400500901_10_a
Hm...? Check this out, guys.
Liz
400500901_9_a
That storm was probably what the
jewel is capable of producing
at full power.
Kirito
400500901_8_a
Ha...ha ha ha...
Silica
400500901_7_a
I-I hope not! That kind of wind
would blow the houses away with
the fog!
Silica
400500901_6_a
Is that the kind of wind they used
to clear up Butterfly Valley too?
Yuuki
400500901_5_a
But even if we do, we'll have to
contend with the powerful winds
the Jewel of Serenity conjures up.
Asuna
400500901_4_a
Still, they couldn't have gone too
far. We'll catch up to them soon
enough.
Kirito
400500901_3_a
Kirito
400500901_2_a
bg_event_desert
Forget a head start. They got away
while we were worried about our
feet!
Leafa
400500901_1_a
And they've got a huge head start
now!
Kirito
400500801_25_a
We'll never catch them at this
rate!
Asuna
400500801_24_a
But the wind is strong enough to
kick up the sand right under our
feet.
Leafa
400500801_23_a
No way, there aren't any traps
like that around here.
Leafa
400500801_22_a
Is it quicksand?!
Kirito
400500801_21_a
The sand's wrapping around
my foot!
Yuuki
400500801_20_a
Geez, now what!
Liz
400500801_19_a
Yikes!
Yuuki
400500801_18_a
So I guess we've gotta hoof it.
Yuuki
400500801_17_a
Wow, she's right. All that sand
the wind kicked up is blocking out
the sun!
Asuna
400500801_16_a
Er... I would, but-are you telling
me we can't fly here either?!
Yuuki
400500801_15_a
I'll take the lead!
Yuuki
400500801_14_a
Okay, okay! Less talk,
more chasing!
Leafa
400500801_13_a
That's pretty much how thieves
operate. They'd rather steal than
fight!
Kirito
400500801_12_a
What the-?! They're getting away!
Silica
400500801_11_a
Gragyaaah!
Goblin
400500801_10_a
Alright, let's get that jewel
back!
Kirito
400500801_9_a
That must be their leader.
Liz
400500801_8_a
The goblin holding it doesn't look
much like a goblin, though...
It's huge!
Silica
400500801_7_a
That looks like the Jewel of
Serenity to me!
Yuuki
400500801_6_a
Hey, that goblin in the middle is
holding a big crystal!
Asuna
400500801_5_a
I don't think they can understand
you.
Leafa
400500801_4_a
Grgyah!
Goblin
400500801_3_a
Leafa
400500801_2_a
bg_event_desert_sandstorm
So, you guys are the roving band
of thieves!
Kirito
400500801_1_a
Y-Yeah!
Kirito
400500701_22_a
Way to stay sharp, Yuuki!
We've got 'em, guys! Let's go!
Leafa
400500701_21_a
Guys, look over there!
We found the goblins!
Yuuki
400500701_20_a
She didn't-er, I didn't-wait,
were you not paying attention
just now?!
Kirito
400500701_19_a
What did Silica try to show you?
Asuna
400500701_18_a
Phew. At least YOU'RE on my side...
Kirito
400500701_17_a
Hahaha! It's pretty hard to see
ANYTHING in a storm like this!
Asuna
400500701_16_a
Seriously, you men are ridiculous!
Liz
400500701_15_a
Ugh! Could you quit being gross
for, like, five seconds? Come on!
Leafa
400500701_14_a
Uh huh... Suuuuure you didn't.
Yuuki
400500701_13_a
Saw what? I didn't see anything!
Kirito
400500701_12_a
H-Hey, Kirito!
You... You saw that, didn't you!
Silica
400500701_11_a
N-Nothing. I'm good.
Kirito
400500701_10_a
What's wrong, Kirito?
Asuna
400500701_9_a
Whoa!
Kirito
400500701_8_a
Yeah, good idea.
Kirito
400500701_7_a
We should be able to keep her
grounded if we all hold hands!
Asuna
400500701_6_a
See? It's 'cause she's so tiny.
Liz
400500701_5_a
Y-You say that, but I'm already
being blown away!
Silica
400500701_4_a
Careful, Silica! Don't blow away
on us!
Leafa
400500701_3_a
Leafa
400500701_2_a
bg_event_desert_sandstorm
Wha-! Ahhhhhhh!
Silica
400500701_1_a
Let's go check it out!
Kirito
400500601_15_a
They must be using the Jewel of
Serenity to kick up some wind and
create that sandstorm.
Leafa
400500601_14_a
Both the storm and whoever's in
there controlling it...
Kirito
400500601_13_a
It's moving really strangely for
a sandstorm, isn't it? I've had
my eye on them for a while.
Kirito
400500601_12_a
Wait, was that...
Did I just see a goblin in that
sandstorm?!
Liz
400500601_11_a
You're right. It's only covering
one part of that little sand dune.
Like it's hiding something...!
Silica
400500601_10_a
And that sandstorm is a little...
weird-looking, don't you think?
Leafa
400500601_9_a
Desert weather can turn on a dime,
but you don't see sandstorms like
THAT every day.
Leafa
400500601_8_a
Whoa, that's incredible...
Is this what it's always like
around here?
Liz
400500601_7_a
Liz, look!
See that sandstorm over there?
Leafa
400500601_6_a
Say what? Did you find something,
Asuna?
Liz
400500601_5_a
Hmm... Interesting. Clearly asking
Klein was the right move.
Asuna
400500601_4_a
That's what I heard from Klein.
Kirito
400500601_3_a
Asuna
400500601_2_a
bg_event_desert
The goblin thieves are crossing
the desert in Salamander
territory.
Kirito
400500601_1_a
You got it!
Leafa
400500501_19_a
Let's start gathering some intel.
Kirito
400500501_18_a
But we can't let them off easy
once we do find them. They ruined
an entire village's way of life.
Kirito
400500501_17_a
Moving targets, eh? Finding them
might be harder than actually
beating them.
Leafa
400500501_16_a
They look like a roving band of
thieves, so it's not as simple as
finding their settlement.
Asuna
400500501_15_a
Alright then-time to go
goblin hunting!
Kirito
400500501_14_a
Aaaand there's the quest!
A window just popped up for me.
Liz
400500501_13_a
Well, they're the only two races
in the village, so I guess that's
just the way it is.
Yuuki
400500501_12_a
I never would've guessed we'd need
a Sylph and a Cait Sith just to
talk to the villagers.
Asuna
400500501_11_a
Thank you both so much.
Asuna
400500501_10_a
It seems a band of goblins
stole it.
Silica
400500501_9_a
Yes, that's more or less what
I heard from the NPCs in the
wind tribe.
Silica
400500501_8_a
I'm guessing that's the same
Jewel of Serenity that got stolen
by a gang of thieving monsters.
Kirito
400500501_7_a
And get this-the wind tribe
helped the settlers create the
fog-clearing Jewel of Serenity.
Leafa
400500501_6_a
Contrary to its lovely name,
Butterfly Valley is really just a
gloomy, foggy place year-round.
Silica
400500501_5_a
They were given this land to
settle on, but it doesn't have
much in the way of resources.
Leafa
400500501_4_a
Kirito
400500501_3_a
Silica
400500501_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_fog
It seems a war never got
totally resolved, leaving some
splinter groups behind.
Leafa
400500501_1_a
Interesting. Let's see what we can
find out.
Kirito
400500401_16_a
Based on the system info, it looks
like runaways from both races
formed it, I guess?
Leafa
400500401_15_a
Which one holds sway in that
village, I wonder?
Yuuki
400500401_14_a
But wait. We're near the border
between Sylph and Cait Sith
territory, aren't we?
Yuuki
400500401_13_a
That looks like one of the wind
tribe's villages. I think they're
all NPCs.
Silica
400500401_12_a
Hey, guys, check it out!
There's a fairy village over
there!
Yuuki
400500401_11_a
Yeah, like what if-
Leafa
400500401_10_a
You think there's more to it?
Kirito
400500401_9_a
Yeah, no doubt. But are we sure
it's just a problem with the
weather?
Leafa
400500401_8_a
This fog is so thick it's blocking
out the sun, and it goes all the
way down to the ground!
Asuna
400500401_7_a
No wonder people can't fly through
here...
Asuna
400500401_6_a
Alicia told me the weather in
Butterfly Valley had been bad
recently, but I had no idea!
Silica
400500401_5_a
Man, this is some serious fog!
Liz
400500401_4_a
Silica
400500401_3_a
Liz
400500401_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_fog
What in the world is this? Fog?
Kirito
400500401_1_a
I can't ever let my other friends
know that we had an argument
about this.
Leafa
400500301_25_a
Ugh, you guys are so weird!
Leafa
400500301_24_a
Hehe, of course you wouldn't!
You're a VRMMO fanatic.
Asuna
400500301_23_a
I didn't really have that much
trouble either, though.
Yuuki
400500301_22_a
HEY! Care to put that a little
more delicately?! Geez.
Liz
400500301_21_a
I mean, let's face it-it's not
like you spent two years in SAO
because you were addicted to it.
Kirito
400500301_20_a
Hahaha!
Spoken like true SAO survivors.
Kirito
400500301_19_a
Oh, be QUIET, Liz!
Silica
400500301_18_a
Yeah, I guess it's hard to feel
stable in the air since you're so
tiny...
Liz
400500301_17_a
It took me forever!
I'm still not 100% confident...
Silica
400500301_16_a
Some people have to keep using
the controller even after, like,
a whole year!
Leafa
400500301_15_a
But STILL. Even compared to
most people, you got the hang
of it REALLY fast.
Leafa
400500301_14_a
It's not that hard once you get
the hang of it, but I definitely
had some trouble!
Liz
400500301_13_a
She's not wrong. Liz and Silica
both got the hang of it really
quickly.
Kirito
400500301_12_a
I'd given Asuna a bunch of flying
lessons, so I knew she was doing
well, but...
Leafa
400500301_11_a
All three of you imported your
avatars into ALO recently, right?
Leafa
400500301_10_a
I mean, seriously, Liz.
You too, Silica and Yuuki...
Leafa
400500301_9_a
I-It's nothing weird! I was just
thinking about how well you've
all mastered flying already.
Leafa
400500301_8_a
And you were eyeing me up too,
weren't you?
Yuuki
400500301_7_a
Y-Yeah! I feel like she's been
staring at me too...
Silica
400500301_6_a
What's BEEN up with you, Leafa?
It feels like you've been watching
our every move this whole time.
Liz
400500301_5_a
Oh, um-
Leafa
400500301_4_a
What's up, Leafa?
Kirito
400500301_3_a
Kirito
400500301_2_a
bg_18_sky_morning
Hmm...
Leafa
400500301_1_a
Silica's right. We'll just have to
uncover the truth for ourselves.
To Butterfly Valley!
Leafa
400500201_21_a
Either way, if the rumor is true
and we can't fly out there, that
could be a death sentence for us!
Silica
400500201_20_a
Don't we?
Or are you saying the rumors could
be fabricated?
Liz
400500201_19_a
On the other hand, WE don't even
know if this is gonna be a quest
or not, do we?
Kirito
400500201_18_a
But you know how adults are.
It's hard for them to fit stuff
into their old people schedules.
Leafa
400500201_17_a
Hahaha! This is great, but just
so you know, I did invite Klein
and Agil too.
Leafa
400500201_16_a
Aw, c'mon, Asuna.
Not you, too!
Kirito
400500201_15_a
Too late...
I've already got it.
Asuna
400500201_14_a
Hey, don't say it like that!
People will get the wrong idea!
Kirito
400500201_13_a
Well, yeah, 'cause SOMEONE we know
is a real lady-killer!
Liz
400500201_12_a
I-It is?
Kirito
400500201_11_a
And as usual, it's almost all
girls!
Yuuki
400500201_10_a
That makes six of us for today.
Kirito
400500201_9_a
Absolutely!
Leafa
400500201_8_a
Hehe, Asuna invited me along,
so here I am. Can I join you guys?
Yuuki
400500201_7_a
Oh, hey!
Silica
400500201_6_a
Sorry I'm late!
Silica
400500201_5_a
Hope you weren't waiting long!
Liz
400500201_4_a
Hey, Kirito! Hey, Leafa!
Asuna
400500201_3_a
Leafa
400500201_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Oh, everybody's here!
Kirito
400500201_1_a
Got it.
Kirito
400500101_25_a
Hm, I see. Well, if you hear
anything at all-even rumors-let
me know right away.
Sakuya
400500101_24_a
No... I haven't heard anything
about this.
Leafa
400500101_23_a
Yes. I've been talking to Alicia's
crew about forming a survey unit.
Do you have any insight, Leafa?
Sakuya
400500101_22_a
Are you serious?
Even though they're outside?
Kirito
400500101_21_a
Indeed. And apparently fairies who
enter its airspace are losing the
ability to fly.
Sakuya
400500101_20_a
That's a spot in the mountain
range on the border of Sylph
and Cait Sith territory, right?
Leafa
400500101_19_a
Butterfly Valley, huh...
Kirito
400500101_18_a
That's okay. Anyway, I've heard
reports of strange occurrences
in Butterfly Valley recently.
Sakuya
400500101_17_a
O-Oh... I'm, um, sorry for butting
in like that...
Leafa
400500101_16_a
But that's not what I was going
to mention in the first place.
Sakuya
400500101_15_a
Would you now? Thank you.
I'll let you know.
Sakuya
400500101_14_a
I would be happy to help.
Kirito
400500101_13_a
Hahaha! If you're looking for an
escort to the talks or need me for
another short-term assignment...
Kirito
400500101_12_a
I was just... You know! Geez...
Leafa
400500101_11_a
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you
were his manager.
Sakuya
400500101_10_a
He doesn't want to fight with the
Sylphs OR be their leader's
bodyguard!
Leafa
400500101_9_a
Sakuya!
What have I told you about
goading Kirito?
Leafa
400500101_8_a
Ah, one last thing...
Sakuya
400500101_7_a
Sure.
Kirito
400500101_6_a
Alright then, should we log out
soon?
Leafa
400500101_5_a
Oh no, the pleasure's all mine.
Sakuya
400500101_4_a
Leafa
400500101_3_a
Sakuya
400500101_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
I'm glad we got to talk like this
Sakuya.
Kirito
400500101_1_a
Wh-What's the deal, guys?
It was so hot a minute ago, but
now all I feel are cold stares...
Kirito
400400901_24_a
...
Asuna
400400901_23_a
...
Silica
400400901_22_a
...
Sinon
400400901_21_a
...
Liz
400400901_20_a
Hahaha! Look, Sinon's turning red!
She went from "smokin' hot" to
"burning up"!
Kirito
400400901_19_a
...
Sinon
400400901_18_a
Let's keep being the best of
friends, okay, Sinonon?
Asuna
400400901_17_a
I... I guess...
Sinon
400400901_16_a
Things got pretty heated back
there, but I think we both got to
know each other much better.
Asuna
400400901_15_a
What...?
Sinon
400400901_14_a
Hehehe...
I'm just glad that you and I could
get closer, Sinonon.
Asuna
400400901_13_a
Oh come on, can we please stop?!
Your burns are way hotter than
that dungeon ever was!
Kirito
400400901_12_a
In this case, it's more like
"Where there's fire, there's
smokin' hot babes." Right, Kirito?
Liz
400400901_11_a
Was it now?
"Where there's smoke,
there's fire."
Sinon
400400901_10_a
What?!
I thought we cleared that up!
Misunderstanding!!
Kirito
400400901_9_a
It wasn't without its bumps
though. We had to deal with
Kirito's lechery. Ick.
Liz
400400901_8_a
That wraps up this little
adventure!
Silica
400400901_7_a
It's a fine weapon, if I do say so
myself! I put all my considerable
talent into making it, after all!
Liz
400400901_6_a
I'm so happy for you, Sinonon!
Asuna
400400901_5_a
I owe all of you for this...
Thank you...
Sinon
400400901_4_a
Asuna
400400901_3_a
Sinon
400400901_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Congrats on your new bow, Sinon!
Kirito
400400901_1_a
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Right away, ma'am!
Kirito
400400801_17_a
No excuses! Turn around!
Face the wall and think about
what you've done!
Sinon
400400801_16_a
I didn't mean to look!
I was just so happy we won and
got the ore and...and-
Kirito
400400801_15_a
H-Hey!
Don't get the wrong idea here!
Kirito
400400801_14_a
Eeeeeek!
Kirito, you pervert!
Silica
400400801_13_a
Ah! I almost forgot!
Our clothes are still wet!
Liz
400400801_12_a
H-Hey! Don't look at me, Kirito!
I never said you could look at me!
Sinon
400400801_11_a
Kirito...
Asuna
400400801_10_a
It's thanks to all of your
passion and hard work.
You really worked for it...
Kirito
400400801_9_a
It was tough, but we came through.
Kirito
400400801_8_a
That was a lot of fun!
And I might as well snatch some
of this for myself!
Liz
400400801_7_a
We did it!
It was all worth it!
Silica
400400801_6_a
item_event_84003_ingot
It sure is....
Infernal Ore. Super rare...
And I finally got some...
Sinon
400400801_5_a
Sinonon! Over there!
That must be the ore!
Asuna
400400801_4_a
Sinon
400400801_3_a
Asuna
400400801_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave_boss
Alright!
Another boss bites the dust!
Kirito
400400801_1_a
Coming right up, Silica!
Asuna
400400701_23_a
Uh...okay?
In that case... Asuna!
I want some water on me too!
Silica
400400701_22_a
Oh, fine!
I give up!
Hose me down!
Liz
400400701_21_a
What's gotten into you two...?
Kirito
400400701_20_a
If that's your move, then fine!
Give me some of that dragon water!
Sinon
400400701_19_a
Ah, I get it. "It's just Kirito.
Who cares if he sees a bit of
skin?" Right?
Sinon
400400701_18_a
Asuna...
Sinon
400400701_17_a
Asuna...
Liz
400400701_16_a
We don't have time to worry about
modesty! Winning is everything!
Asuna
400400701_15_a
Kirito's right! Who cares about a
bit of wet clothing! If it helps
us beat this dungeon, I'll do it!
Asuna
400400701_14_a
Asuna?! Are you sure?!
Silica
400400701_13_a
Silica!
Hit me with Pina's best shot!
Asuna
400400701_12_a
You don't mean...
Kirito
400400701_11_a
I have to do whatever it takes to
finish this dungeon!
Asuna
400400701_10_a
You're right...
I don't have room to be picky
about how I beat this, do I...?
Asuna
400400701_9_a
Our friendship aside, this dungeon
is still too hot for Asuna...
Sinon
400400701_8_a
Asuna...?
Kirito
400400701_7_a
Y-Yeah...
Asuna
400400701_6_a
Ahaha! Asuna and Sinon did settle
this nice and neatly. No knight
in a black coat needed!
Silica
400400701_5_a
What?! No! Noooo!
Wh-Why would I think that?
Kirito
400400701_4_a
Is that what you were reaaally
thinking just now? Not
"Aww, I wanted the limelight..."?
Liz
400400701_3_a
Liz
400400701_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
Ha ha...
All's well that ends well, right?
Kirito
400400701_1_a
Liiiiiiz!!!
Asuna
400400602_15_a
Besides, you two are BFFs now!
That's the important thing, right?
Liz
400400602_14_a
Aww, lighten up! I was just
playing with you!
Liz
400400602_13_a
Liar!
You were making fun of me!
Asuna
400400602_12_a
Duh, of course that's a
compliment!
Liz
400400602_11_a
Liz! Was that supposed to be a
compliment?!
Asuna
400400602_10_a
Heh, can't argue there.
Sinon
400400602_9_a
Yeah, girl, Asuna's a tiger!
Growl!
Liz
400400602_8_a
sniff
That was...beautiful!
I think I'm gonna cry...
Silica
400400602_7_a
Yeah!
For sure!
Asuna
400400602_6_a
I admit it, I'm impressed.
...Come on.
Let's go find us some ore.
Sinon
400400602_5_a
Sinon...
Asuna
400400602_4_a
I think I misjudged you, Asuna.
You seem like the soft type,
but you've got steel in you.
Sinon
400400602_3_a
Asuna
400400602_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
Heh...
Thanks, Asuna.
Sinon
400400602_1_a
Asuna...
Sinon
400400601_18_a
Exactly. If I do it, other Undines
will follow in my footsteps! The
impossible will become possible!
Asuna
400400601_17_a
So if Asuna finds some, she'll
probably be the first Undine ever
to get their hands on it.
Kirito
400400601_16_a
Ha ha, I think I see your point.
This ore was just added in, right?
Kirito
400400601_15_a
I want to prove that no matter how
hard something may seem,
there's always a chance!
Asuna
400400601_14_a
But there's no such thing as
"impossible" in a VRMMO!
Asuna
400400601_13_a
Think about it! Normally, there's
no way an Undine could beat this
dungeon, right?
Asuna
400400601_12_a
You are?
Sinon
400400601_11_a
Hehe, besides!
I'm planning on getting something
out of this too!
Asuna
400400601_10_a
Asuna...
Sinon
400400601_9_a
So I want to do everything I can
to help you.
Like everyone did for me.
Asuna
400400601_8_a
So I think I understand what
you're going through. You're in a
new world, lost and confused.
Asuna
400400601_7_a
But Kirito and a whole lot of
other people came together to save
me. Thanks to them, I'm free now.
Asuna
400400601_6_a
I was locked in a cage, tormented
daily by the worst guy on Earth.
I couldn't even log out.
Asuna
400400601_5_a
When I first came to ALO,
it was under the worst possible
circumstances...
Asuna
400400601_4_a
Huh?
Sinon
400400601_3_a
Sinon
400400601_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
Sinonon...
I get it...
Asuna
400400601_1_a
Sinon...
Kirito
400400501_14_a
I should just give up and learn
how to fight like an ALO player.
Sinon
400400501_13_a
I shouldn't be trying to turn my
bow into a sniper rifle.
Sinon
400400501_12_a
I'm a Cait Sith now.
This is ALO.
Sinon
400400501_11_a
You won't get anything out of this
whole dungeon trip. You're just
helping me indulge a selfish whim.
Sinon
400400501_10_a
Hey Asuna... Actually, let me
ask all of you. Why are you
doing all of this for me?
Sinon
400400501_9_a
Asuna...
Kirito
400400501_8_a
No, I'll be fine.
We've come this far. It'd be a
shame to leave empty-handed.
Asuna
400400501_7_a
Asuna, do you want to turn back?
I don't mind returning another
day.
Sinon
400400501_6_a
I suppose fire caves are just too
hot for Undines, huh?
Liz
400400501_5_a
Yeah... I'm fine...
Asuna
400400501_4_a
Asuna, are you okay?
Kirito
400400501_3_a
Kirito
400400501_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
It's...really hot...
Asuna
400400501_1_a
Urk! So you're saying this still
doesn't prove my innocence?!
Kirito
400400401_22_a
That's because his clothes are
black, Silica. Black clothes don't
get transparent...
Asuna
400400401_21_a
Ahaha...
Asuna
400400401_20_a
Aww, but I can't see through
Kirito's clothes at all...
Silica
400400401_19_a
Oh.
Oh yeah...
Kirito
400400401_18_a
We were objecting to the whole
"see-through clothing" part of it.
Sinon
400400401_17_a
You do know we weren't objecting
to the water itself, right?
Sinon
400400401_16_a
So I was right all along!
My idea had merit! Hah!
Kirito
400400401_15_a
Really! I can still feel the heat,
but it's definitely bearable now.
Kirito
400400401_14_a
Really?!
Liz
400400401_13_a
Since then, I've been watching and
waiting...and I feel much cooler!
Kirito
400400401_12_a
Yeah.
I was careful, so it barely hurt.
Kirito
400400401_11_a
Kirito! You didn't!
Are you okay?!
Silica
400400401_10_a
What?!
Asuna
400400401_9_a
I...was hoping to prove my
innocence, so I let those water
attacks hit me during the fight.
Kirito
400400401_8_a
Kirito?
What's the matter?
You've been really quiet.
Sinon
400400401_7_a
...
Kirito
400400401_6_a
Yeah! Pina's bubble breath is
a water attack too, so it kicks
some serious fire monster tail!
Silica
400400401_5_a
Still, I should have expected it,
but water magic works REALLY well
on monsters here, huh?
Asuna
400400401_4_a
No problem!
Asuna
400400401_3_a
Asuna
400400401_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
Thanks, Asuna.
You saved me back there.
Sinon
400400401_1_a
Y-Yeah. Let's hurry up and get out
of this awkward...heat.
Kirito
400400302_24_a
Listening to this is worse than
the heat.
Sinon
400400302_23_a
Ugh. Are we done yet?
Can we please move on?
Sinon
400400302_22_a
N-No, I'm innocent too!
Silica
400400302_21_a
Silica, you traitor!
Sneaking behind our backs to
score points with Kirito!
Liz
400400302_20_a
Ehehe... Of course!
Silica
400400302_19_a
S-Silica, you're on my side...
right?
Kirito
400400302_18_a
Liz! No way!
Are you complimenting Klein?!
That's going too far!
Silica
400400302_17_a
At least Klein just comes out and
says everything he's thinking. No
subtlety. That's nice, in a way.
Liz
400400302_16_a
Asuna?! You too?!
Kirito
400400302_15_a
But it IS true that some fabrics
in VRMMOs get a bit transparent
when they get wet...
Asuna
400400302_14_a
Wh-What is up with you guys
today?! No! I wasn't thinking
that at all! I'm not Klein!!
Kirito
400400302_13_a
You're really rotten to the core,
aren't you?
Sinon
400400302_12_a
K-Kirito...
Silica
400400302_11_a
WHAT?!
Asuna
400400302_10_a
What...?
Kirito
400400302_9_a
You wanted us to get each other
wet so our clothes would get
clingy and see-through, RIGHT?!
Liz
400400302_8_a
I think I've seen through your
diabolical scheme!
Liz
400400302_7_a
AH! What?!
Kirito
400400302_6_a
Kirito!!
Liz
400400302_5_a
About this plan to shoot water
magic in each other's faces...
Liz
400400302_4_a
Liz, what's up?
Something bothering you?
Kirito
400400302_3_a
Kirito
400400302_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
Hmmm...
Liz
400400302_1_a
Well, I'm convinced. Rather than
sit here sweating buckets while we
talk, let's give it a try.
Sinon
400400301_16_a
Maybe there's some other ability
that we're overlooking, though...
Kirito
400400301_15_a
In other words, regular buffs
and passive resistances aren't
enough to cool us down.
Kirito
400400301_14_a
Oh yeah!
I totally forgot!
Silica
400400301_13_a
Remember Silica? I already did
that before we came in.
Asuna
400400301_12_a
Couldn't we just cast anti-fire
buffs on us?
Wouldn't that help?
Silica
400400301_11_a
That is true.
Sinon
400400301_10_a
but ALO's Pain Absorber is set way
higher than the one in GGO.
Kirito
400400301_9_a
It might hurt a little bit,
Kirito
400400301_8_a
Exactly.
Kirito
400400301_7_a
You mean, attack each other?
Sinon
400400301_6_a
How about this? We hit each other
with weak water magic attacks?
Kirito
400400301_5_a
Y-Yeah, you're right...
Asuna
400400301_4_a
Let's return to the issue at hand.
The heat really is a problem.
Kirito
400400301_3_a
Asuna
400400301_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
Okay, jokes aside, can we move
on? Please?
Kirito
400400301_1_a
Explain what, Kirito?
Sinon
400400202_21_a
Sinon... Can you please explain?
Dig me out of this hole?
Kirito
400400202_20_a
LIZ?!
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?!
Asuna
400400202_19_a
Whoa there, Silica! Stop sign!
Red light! Asuna's the only one
he can watch undress!
Liz
400400202_18_a
K-Kirito... I d-didn't know you
had such naughty habits...
But if it's what you like, then...
Silica
400400202_17_a
Oh, you have a habit of that,
do you? Sinonon, details. Now.
Asuna
400400202_16_a
N-No! That was a misunderstanding!
I'm innocent! Innocent!!
Kirito
400400202_15_a
Everyone, be on your guard.
That boy has a habit of staring at
girls as they get undressed.
Sinon
400400202_14_a
N-Nothing...?
Kirito
400400202_13_a
Hold it right there, Kirito! What
do you think you're staring at?!
Liz
400400202_12_a
...
Kirito
400400202_11_a
Besides, from where I'm standing,
you guys already are showing waaay
too much!
Liz
400400202_10_a
What?!
Take any more off and you'll
be breaking the law!
Liz
400400202_9_a
Wait, I have an idea!
It'll lower our defense, but why
not remove some armor?
Asuna
400400202_8_a
It'll be hard to focus on fighting
in this heat...
Liz
400400202_7_a
I think Pina's struggling here.
She is a water dragon after all...
Silica
400400202_6_a
Chirp...
Pina
400400202_5_a
It really is hot...
Sinon
400400202_4_a
Pina
400400202_3_a
Sinon
400400202_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
Ugh, it's like a sauna in here...
Liz
400400202_1_a
Sure thing!
Silica
400400201_16_a
Alright, stop dawdling! Let's go!
Liz
400400201_15_a
Good point. I'll be careful.
Asuna
400400201_14_a
Speaking of elements, Asuna should
be extra careful. Undines are
probably weak to fire.
Sinon
400400201_13_a
Hey guys, now that's just mean...
Kirito
400400201_12_a
I know! He could've been our fire
shield! Just throw him at the
fire monsters and watch him burn!
Liz
400400201_11_a
Well, having a Salamander on our
side for this would be extremely
helpful.
Silica
400400201_10_a
I bet he thought that this was
his chance to show off and try to
look cool.
Liz
400400201_9_a
Ahaha! Too bad, Klein!
We're already on our way to the
fire caves!
Liz
400400201_8_a
DUDE! NO WAY! I was the one who
told you guys about that! You
gotta wait for me! Go tomorrow!
Kirito
400400201_7_a
He responded to my message with:
Kirito
400400201_6_a
Oh yeah, Klein. I sent him an
invite, but he's tied up at a
party with his coworkers.
Kirito
400400201_5_a
Shouldn't we invite Klein?
He was the one that found this
info, after all.
Asuna
400400201_4_a
Forgot what?
Kirito
400400201_3_a
Kirito
400400201_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
You know, I almost forgot...
Asuna
400400201_1_a
Come on, no loitering!
Let's get a move on!
Liz
400400101_37_a
B-But! I! You! Uh...
Th-Thank you, everyone...
Sinon
400400101_36_a
Now that I know what you're after,
I have to help!
Asuna
400400101_35_a
Of course we are!
Kirito
400400101_34_a
You're...helping me?
Sinon
400400101_33_a
Duh! We're going to go find some
of that ore so we can make you a
shiny new bow!
Liz
400400101_32_a
Umm... What?
What's going on?
Why's everyone getting up?
Sinon
400400101_31_a
Sounds like so much fun!
Silica
400400101_30_a
I'm not missing this.
Asuna
400400101_29_a
Count me in.
Kirito
400400101_28_a
Alright, then what are we waiting
for? Let's go!
Liz
400400101_27_a
...
Sinon
400400101_26_a
Fire magic has incredible range,
so I guess an arrow imbued with
fire gets a range buff?
Kirito
400400101_25_a
Why does a fire bow have super
long range?
Asuna
400400101_24_a
The fire bow you can make out of
it has the longest range out of
anything in ALO.
Silica
400400101_23_a
He said that this new ore appeared
in a cave in Salamander territory.
Silica
400400101_22_a
Oh! I almost forgot!
I talked to Klein the other day...
Silica
400400101_21_a
No, it's okay. I'm fine.
Sinon
400400101_20_a
Ah... So that's why...
Sinonon, I'm sorry I made you
uncomfortable.
Asuna
400400101_19_a
I was kind of embarrassed...
Sinon
400400101_18_a
Everyone's having so much fun here
playing ALO, and I'm still
stuck in GGO mode...
Sinon
400400101_17_a
It's... Umm... Well...
Sinon
400400101_16_a
But if that's all you needed,
why were you so hesitant to say
so?
Asuna
400400101_15_a
I'm not that surprised.
In GGO, Sinon could snipe people
two kilometers away...
Kirito
400400101_14_a
No way! That's still not long
enough of a range for you...?
Liz
400400101_13_a
Yeah, you did... But I was hoping
you could make me one that could
shoot even farther.
Sinon
400400101_12_a
A bow?
Didn't I just make you one?
That crazy long-range one?!
Liz
400400101_11_a
Th-That's okay... I'm fine.
I just came to see if Liz could
make me a new bow.
Sinon
400400101_10_a
If you have some business with
Liz, we can leave you two alone.
Asuna
400400101_9_a
N-No...
Not at all...
Sinon
400400101_8_a
Umm...
Is that bad or something?
Kirito
400400101_7_a
Everyone's here, huh...
Sinon
400400101_6_a
Hey, Sinonon!
Asuna
400400101_5_a
Look! It's Sinon!
Silica
400400101_4_a
What's up, Sinon?
Kirito
400400101_3_a
Oh, hey, Sinon.
Fancy seeing you here.
Liz
400400101_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Good afternoon...
Sinon
400400101_1_a
I love you all!
Yui
400301001_32_a
I... Thank you, Mommy and Daddy!
Thank you, everyone!
Yui
400301001_31_a
Me too!
Asuna
400301001_30_a
I'll do my best so that you don't
start feeling sad again, okay?
Kirito
400301001_29_a
Yui, you were right about one
thing. We can only see each other
in VR. But we're still family!
Kirito
400301001_28_a
Umm... Yeah! Sure!
Thank you so much, everyone!
I'm...I'm so happy!
Yui
400301001_27_a
Hehehe... So, Yui! Is it okay if
we celebrate your birthday today?
Asuna
400301001_26_a
Oh, come on, Agil!
You're one to talk!
Klein
400301001_25_a
Klein, you're already pretty long
in the tooth, if you ask me.
Agil
400301001_24_a
But then I'll be the only one
getting older!
Klein
400301001_23_a
Yeah, Klein. You can go have a
birthday every day by yourself.
Have a blast.
Liz
400301001_22_a
But Klein, if she does that,
then her birthday won't be special
anymore!
Silica
400301001_21_a
Yeah! Why not say every day's
your birthday?!
Klein
400301001_20_a
It doesn't have to be today,
if you don't want it to be.
Asuna
400301001_19_a
Don't know your birthday?
In that case, why can't we just
say today's the big day?
Kirito
400301001_18_a
A b-birthday party...?
For me? But I don't-
Yui
400301001_17_a
We all wanted to do something for
you, so here we are!
It's a birthday party!
Kirito
400301001_16_a
So I had a talk with everyone.
Kirito
400301001_15_a
I was thinking about our talk the
other day, about how you were
feeling blue.
Kirito
400301001_14_a
Yeah, sure.
Yui, sorry if we startled you.
Kirito
400301001_13_a
Hey guys? I think our little star
here has no idea what's going on.
C'mon, Daddy, tell her what's up.
Agil
400301001_12_a
Umm...
Yui
400301001_11_a
Over here, Yui! You're the star
today, so you sit in the center!
Klein
400301001_10_a
Yui! Have a very happy birthday!
Silica
400301001_9_a
Happy birthday!
Liz
400301001_8_a
Leafa! And Liz! Silica...
Even Agil and Klein are here?
Yui
400301001_7_a
Congrats, kid!
Leafa
400301001_6_a
Mommy!
Yui
400301001_5_a
Yui... Happy birthday!
Asuna
400301001_4_a
Thank you...
Yui
400301001_3_a
Good job
Kirito
400301001_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Okay then...
Yui
400301001_1_a
Yup, go ahead!
Kirito
400300901_28_a
May I, Daddy?
Yui
400300901_27_a
Yui
400300901_26_a
Yui, can you...turn back into a
human right now?
I think we both need a hug...
Kirito
400300901_25_a
Daddy...
Yui
400300901_24_a
Rather, I'm sorry I didn't notice
earlier. I'm so sorry, Yui...
Kirito
400300901_23_a
No, you didn't upset me...
Don't worry about that...
Kirito
400300901_22_a
I'm sorry, Daddy...
I didn't mean to upset you...
Yui
400300901_21_a
I think that's why I sometimes
feel sad when I'm with all of you.
Yui
400300901_20_a
Yes. I feel a great gap between
me, an AI, and everyone else.
You exist in the real world...
Yui
400300901_19_a
Sad...?
Kirito
400300901_18_a
When I see everyone having fun
together, I feel a little bit sad.
Yui
400300901_17_a
This is...just a theory I have,
but perhaps...
Yui
400300901_16_a
However, my ability to simulate
emotions has remained unchanged
from SAO.
Yui
400300901_15_a
Yui...
Kirito
400300901_14_a
I guarantee you the system won't
delete me. And as long as you're
in VR, I'll be by your side.
Yui
400300901_13_a
And Daddy's private pixie, too!
Yui
400300901_12_a
Hehe... Oh Daddy!
I'm an ALO navigation pixie now!
Yui
400300901_11_a
I'm...scared for you.
Kirito
400300901_10_a
I'm...I'm worried that you'll go
away again. Like when Cardinal
thought you were a foreign object.
Kirito
400300901_9_a
If something's troubling you,
you can tell me. Okay?
Kirito
400300901_8_a
Especially around everyone.
Maybe I'm imagining it,
but you seem really sad.
Kirito
400300901_7_a
Huh...?
Yui
400300901_6_a
I'm probably just worrying too
much, but I'm concerned about you.
You've been acting strange lately.
Kirito
400300901_5_a
Yes! What is it?
Yui
400300901_4_a
Yui, can I ask you something?
Kirito
400300901_3_a
Kirito
400300901_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Hi, Daddy!
Let's have tons of fun today!
Yui
400300901_1_a
Y-Yeah, you're right.
Thanks, Sugu.
I'll ask her myself.
Kirito
400300801_22_a
Yui's your daughter, right?
No way she'd be upset if you told
her you were worried about her.
Leafa
400300801_21_a
Sugu...
Kirito
400300801_20_a
If you think she's acting odd,
you should ask her directly.
Confront her about it.
Leafa
400300801_19_a
But Yui's different, right?
Leafa
400300801_18_a
Kazuto, your everyday AI doesn't
have a shred of emotion in it.
Leafa
400300801_17_a
Maybe I'm worrying over nothing,
but I feel this icy hand gripping
my chest when I look at her...
Kirito
400300801_16_a
Something about her today reminded
me of when...when she went away.
Kirito
400300801_15_a
Then, after we helped her recover
her memories, she disappeared...
Kirito
400300801_14_a
Back in SAO, Yui just kind of
appeared in front of me and Asuna.
Kirito
400300801_13_a
Sarcasm noted. Sorry, I'll try
to be more specific...
Kirito
400300801_12_a
Thank you, that's very helpful.
Yes, of course. "Something."
Leafa
400300801_11_a
Well, kinda. I can't really put
my finger on it, but something
about her felt...off.
Kirito
400300801_10_a
Why? Did something happen?
Leafa
400300801_9_a
O-Oh... Okay...
Kirito
400300801_8_a
Huh?
She seemed the same to me...
Leafa
400300801_7_a
Didn't you think Yui was acting
a bit weird today?
Kirito
400300801_6_a
What is it?
Leafa
400300801_5_a
Yui's asleep now, so we can talk.
Something's been bothering me...
Kirito
400300801_4_a
Yeah? What's up, Kazuto?
Leafa
400300801_3_a
Leafa
400300801_2_a
bg_21_alne_inn
Hey, Sugu?
Kirito
400300801_1_a
R-Right...
Nevermind then...
Kirito
400300702_18_a
Really? I feel completely normal.
Nothing different here.
Yui
400300702_17_a
You're acting kinda...strange...
Kirito
400300702_16_a
What do you mean?
Yui
400300702_15_a
Huh?
Yui
400300702_14_a
What's up?
Kirito
400300702_13_a
Yui...?
Kirito
400300702_12_a
...
Yui
400300702_11_a
Yeah! Of course!
Yui
400300702_10_a
Yui, are you okay with that? Think
you can get along with everyone?
Kirito
400300702_9_a
Yeah, I'd trust every one of them
with my life. I'm sure we'll be
seeing a lot more of them...
Kirito
400300702_8_a
You have a lot of good friends,
don't you?
Yui
400300702_7_a
I'm glad you got to meet everyone.
I'm sure Leafa, Liz, Silica, Agil,
and Klein enjoyed meeting you too.
Kirito
400300702_6_a
So that's what has you smiling.
Come to think of it, you only ever
met me and Asuna in SAO.
Kirito
400300702_5_a
I had so much fun today!
I'm so happy I got to talk so much
with all of Daddy's friends!
Yui
400300702_4_a
Yui, fess up. What is it?
Kirito
400300702_3_a
Kirito
400300702_2_a
bg_21_alne_inn
Hehehe...
Yui
400300702_1_a
U-Uh, nevermind...
Kirito
400300701_21_a
Huh...?
Yui
400300701_20_a
You're acting a bit...odd...
Kirito
400300701_19_a
Yes? What is it?
Yui
400300701_18_a
Yui...?
Kirito
400300701_17_a
...
Yui
400300701_16_a
Pina
400300701_15_a
Hahaha!
Kirito
400300701_14_a
Dude! That last part was totally
unnecessary!
Klein
400300701_13_a
Wow, Klein! You've got girls all
over you!
Every dog has its day, huh?
Agil
400300701_12_a
May I please have it?
Silica
400300701_11_a
Klein! Pina wants that ore too!
Silica
400300701_10_a
Chirp!
Pina
400300701_9_a
H-Hey! Low blow! That's got
nothing to do with this!
Klein
400300701_8_a
Seriously?! You'd charge a friend?
You're the lowest of the low! No
wonder you can't get a girlfriend!
Liz
400300701_7_a
Oh ho, is that so? So, Liz!
How much'll you give me for it?
Klein
400300701_6_a
That's a pretty high-level ore,
isn't it? I'm sure it could fetch
a high price.
Kirito
400300701_5_a
Nuh-uh! This is mine! All mine!
Klein
400300701_4_a
Aw man, I wanted one of those!
Hey Klein, old buddy, old pal!
Help a girl out?
Liz
400300701_3_a
Congrats, Klein.
Agil
400300701_2_a
item_event_84003_ingot
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Whoa! Check this out!
This is crazy rare! Woohoo!
I'm on fire today!
Klein
400300701_1_a
But I want to hurry up and get 
good enough to fight alongside
both of you!
Asuna
400300601_21_a
Hehe, thanks for the compliments.
Asuna
400300601_20_a
That is true...
Yui
400300601_19_a
She was one of the Assault Team's
best in SAO, after all.
Leafa
400300601_18_a
Ahaha, that's where you're wrong,
Yui. I'm pretty sure Asuna's
gunning for the stars!
Leafa
400300601_17_a
There are players
who continue using
the controller...
Yui
400300601_16_a
Actually, Mommy, there are a
number of far more basic skills.
It's hardly the starting line.
Yui
400300601_15_a
That's like the starting line here
in ALO, right? If I can't do that,
I can't do anything!
Asuna
400300601_14_a
I didn't know that...
But anyway...I WILL learn how to
fly without the controller!
Asuna
400300601_13_a
I think all of them required you
to use a controller, too.
Kirito
400300601_12_a
There are, but none give you the
freedom that ALO does.
It's a pioneer in that sense.
Kirito
400300601_11_a
Are there other VRMMOs where you
can fly?
Asuna
400300601_10_a
Yeah, I never played any other
games before that...
Asuna
400300601_9_a
Yeah, that's right. The only
VRMMO you've played before
is SAO, isn't it?
Kirito
400300601_8_a
So I'm honestly not used to it
at all yet.
Asuna
400300601_7_a
R-Really?
There wasn't anything like this in
SAO...
Asuna
400300601_6_a
You're still using the controller,
but you've gotten pretty good at
flying now, huh?
Kirito
400300601_5_a
R-Right...
Asuna
400300601_4_a
Don't force it! Just take it slow!
Concentrate on the spot just
between your shoulder blades!
Leafa
400300601_3_a
Nice, Mommy!
Just like that!
Yui
400300601_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
Ahh! No... Grrrr! Hah!
Asuna
400300601_1_a
Thanks, Leafa! Thanks, Yui!
Asuna
400300501_27_a
Mommy, you can ask me anything
too! I'm a navigation pixie,
so I know lots!
Yui
400300501_26_a
Oof... Double dummy'ed...
Kirito
400300501_25_a
I know I'm a better teacher than
my dummy brother over here!
Leafa
400300501_24_a
Great! So, ask me anything!
I'll whip you into shape!
Leafa
400300501_23_a
Still...your initial point was
valid. It'd be good to go over the
basics again.
Asuna
400300501_22_a
Argh! You big dummy!
Asuna
400300501_21_a
Ahh, ha ha...
O-Of course it is! Probably!
Kirito
400300501_20_a
Kirito... Is that supposed to be
a compliment?!
Asuna
400300501_19_a
and people'll be like "Dude! Look
at that Undine! She's like,
running around stabbing people!"
Kirito
400300501_18_a
I mean, Asuna? Sitting back and
casting spells? No way! I bet
you'll swing around your rapier,
Kirito
400300501_17_a
Um, what are you muttering about?
Asuna
400300501_16_a
Asuna...and magic, huh?
Kirito
400300501_15_a
Undines need to master the use of
magic to be effective.
Yui
400300501_14_a
That's right.
Undines are designed to act as
support characters.
Yui
400300501_13_a
Their playstyle is probably
totally different from anything
in SAO.
Leafa
400300501_12_a
Yeah, that sounds good to me!
Asuna's playing an Undine, too.
Leafa
400300501_11_a
You're still getting used to ALO,
right, Asuna? Why don't we do some
tutorials together instead?
Kirito
400300501_10_a
We don't have to go questing.
Kirito
400300501_9_a
But I guess it's too late to do
a quest, huh?
Asuna
400300501_8_a
No worries!
Kirito
400300501_7_a
No, seriously!
Sorry to keep you all waiting!
Asuna
400300501_6_a
Hi there, Asuna!
Leafa
400300501_5_a
Hey, Asuna, you made it!
Kirito
400300501_4_a
Hello there, Yui!
Asuna
400300501_3_a
Oh! Hi, Mommy!
Yui
400300501_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
Sorry for the wait!
Asuna
400300501_1_a
Hahaha! Oh, you two!
Yui
400300401_23_a
Ahaha, nice flabbergast-back!
Leafa
400300401_22_a
Hold up! Is that a little bit
flabbergasted or flabbergasted
out of your mind flabbergasted?!
Kirito
400300401_21_a
and then I hear her call you
"Daddy." I was juuust a teensy bit
COMPLETELY FLABBERGASTED!!!
Leafa
400300401_20_a
Actually, Kazuto...
So I finally got used to hearing
you called "Kirito" here,
Leafa
400300401_19_a
Of course we get along!
Yui's my baby girl!
Kirito
400300401_18_a
It's hard to believe that you're
an AI...
Leafa
400300401_17_a
I couldn't believe you two got
along so well!
Leafa
400300401_16_a
Actually, I was really surprised
when I first saw you chatting with
Kazuto, Yui!
Leafa
400300401_15_a
Hehehe!
You two get along really well,
don't you?
Yui
400300401_14_a
Ugh, did you really just say that?
Out loud?
Leafa
400300401_13_a
Besides, if you keep laying on the
praise, you'll just keep feeding
my already swollen ego!
Kirito
400300401_12_a
Ha ha, just you wait! I'll be
better than you in no time!
Kirito
400300401_11_a
you'll soon be leaving me
fluttering in your wake.
Leafa
400300401_10_a
Seriously, though, with the rate at
which you're improving,
Leafa
400300401_9_a
Ha ha ha!
Leafa
400300401_8_a
but I guess I can't compete with
Sugu when it comes to advanced
aerial techniques.
Kirito
400300401_7_a
I thought I had mastered flying
at top speed by now,
Kirito
400300401_6_a
Really? I have?
Kirito
400300401_5_a
You've gotten much better at
hovering, Daddy!
Yui
400300401_4_a
Urgh...
Kirito
400300401_3_a
Kirito
400300401_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Yeah! Just like that!
Leafa
400300401_1_a
Hehe... I suppose this is all part
of the job, huh? Navigation pixie
by day, etiquette pixie by night!
Kirito
400300301_22_a
Roger, Captain Yui!
Kirito
400300301_21_a
Y-Yes, ma'am! Sorry!
Leafa
400300301_20_a
The point is, forget real life!
Yui
400300301_19_a
I see...
Leafa
400300301_18_a
There were a few items that let
you hide. People did use them,
but they had limited charges...
Kirito
400300301_17_a
There was, but it was nowhere near
as useful as ALO's magic.
Kirito
400300301_16_a
Wasn't there stealth in SAO too?
Leafa
400300301_15_a
There's always a chance that
someone's out there watching us
right now.
Kirito
400300301_14_a
Well, anyway...you're right, Yui.
There's a lot of stealth and
concealment magic in ALO.
Kirito
400300301_13_a
Ouch...
Kirito
400300301_12_a
Wow...
Was that an attempt at comedy?
Don't quit your day job.
Leafa
400300301_11_a
S-Sorry...
I guess...I need to turn over a
new Leafa here in ALO!
Kirito
400300301_10_a
You should try to avoid doing so.
Yui
400300301_9_a
But please be advised that
bringing up real life in-game
is a serious breach of etiquette.
Yui
400300301_8_a
Excuse me. Daddy, Leafa, as we are
the only ones here, using your
real names is acceptable.
Yui
400300301_7_a
Yup! I did all my exercises
and everything!
Leafa
400300301_6_a
Don't worry about it!
You finished kendo practice?
Kirito
400300301_5_a
Sorry I'm late!
Leafa
400300301_4_a
Leafa!
Yui
400300301_3_a
Hey Sugu!
Kirito
400300301_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Kazuto! Yui!
Leafa
400300301_1_a
Thanks, Yui. I think I will.
Kirito
400300202_20_a
I think you should experiment
and find the style that suits you!
Yui
400300202_19_a
Many players ignore magic and
focus on their physical prowess.
General Eugene, for example.
Yui
400300202_18_a
Besides, there are many different
fighting styles in ALO.
Yui
400300202_17_a
That is true. However, the skills
you picked up in SAO are still
valid. The core game is the same.
Yui
400300202_16_a
I think I've also got to focus on
magic more, or I'll never make it
in ALO.
Kirito
400300202_15_a
I still need to master how to
fight in mid-air.
Kirito
400300202_14_a
But if I let myself get complacent
and never change my playstyle,
I'm sure I'll hit a wall.
Kirito
400300202_13_a
Ha ha, thanks for the compliment.
I do have some confidence
in my reaction speed.
Kirito
400300202_12_a
After all, you're an amazing
gamer, Daddy!
Yui
400300202_11_a
From that perspective, deleting
your data was not that severe
of a setback after all.
Yui
400300202_10_a
Your strength comes more from your
physical and mental abilities,
not from levels.
Yui
400300202_9_a
That's right. However,
this also means that ALO is a
highly skill-based action game.
Yui
400300202_8_a
Instead, each skill has a level.
I'm going to have to go and up all
of them from here on out.
Kirito
400300202_7_a
Yeah. Unlike SAO, ALO doesn't have
any character levels.
Kirito
400300202_6_a
You mean the power of your
attacks?
Yui
400300202_5_a
I was just thinking about how
weak I am right now.
Kirito
400300202_4_a
What's the matter?
Yui
400300202_3_a
Yui
400300202_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Hmm... Right...
Kirito
400300202_1_a
Of course!
Kirito
400300201_18_a
Hehehe.
You're really having fun,
aren't you?
Yui
400300201_17_a
I see. That would make sense.
Yui
400300201_16_a
I was just thinking about how
happy I am to just PLAY a game.
Kirito
400300201_15_a
Ahaha, well, I suppose you can
call that a sigh of contentment?
Kirito
400300201_14_a
Umm...
I understand your reasons for
walking now, but why the sigh?
Yui
400300201_13_a
Ahhh...
Kirito
400300201_12_a
Yeah, that's exactly why I'm
taking my time with it. Games are
about having fun, right?
Kirito
400300201_11_a
so there isn't any time limit.
Yui
400300201_10_a
I see...
I suppose your current quest is
made for new characters,
Yui
400300201_9_a
knowing how to maneuver down here
and knowing what the land was like
would be really helpful.
Kirito
400300201_8_a
If I somehow lost the ability to
fly, or if a special quest made me
fight on the ground,
Kirito
400300201_7_a
but if I flew everywhere, I'd have
no idea what it's like down here.
Kirito
400300201_6_a
Oh, that's what you meant.
I'm sure it would be faster
to fly,
Kirito
400300201_5_a
It would be far faster to simply
fly to your destination.
You can fly now, right, Daddy?
Yui
400300201_4_a
What do you mean?
Kirito
400300201_3_a
Kirito
400300201_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Daddy, why are you walking?
Yui
400300201_1_a
Thanks, Yui!
Kirito
400300101_19_a
I'll do my best to guide my newbie
Daddy around!
Yui
400300101_18_a
So now, as your private navigation
pixie in ALO,
Yui
400300101_17_a
Yup! That's basically it!
Kirito
400300101_16_a
I'm happy you're planning on going
out and having lots of fun here in
ALO!
Yui
400300101_15_a
I don't think I fully understand
your reasons, but...
Yui
400300101_14_a
Daddy...
Yui
400300101_13_a
Now I can put all of that behind
me and go back to enjoying games
for what they're meant to be: fun.
Kirito
400300101_12_a
I did it all to put an end to that
death game. Or at least, I'd
like to believe that.
Kirito
400300101_11_a
I don't want to sound all
self-important or anything, but
the strength I gained in SAO...
Kirito
400300101_10_a
I feel like I've done everything
I had to do, I suppose.
Kirito
400300101_9_a
Now that Aincrad is gone and I've
saved Asuna in ALO...
Kirito
400300101_8_a
Hmm... It's hard to put my finger
on exactly why, but all my stats
and levels were from SAO, right?
Kirito
400300101_7_a
Yeah, Daddy, why did you delete it?
I really want to know.
Yui
400300101_6_a
What possessed me to delete all of
my exported combat data and start
over with a blank slate?
Kirito
400300101_5_a
But seriously, I really went and
did it.
Kirito
400300101_4_a
Yeah!
Yui
400300101_3_a
Yui
400300101_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Come on, Yui, let's have fun today!
Kirito
400300101_1_a
YOU WILL FIGURE NOTHING OUT!
Asuna
400200901_23_a
Figure what out...?
Kirito
400200901_22_a
Aww, don't pout, Kii-boy!
One day I'm sure ya'll figure
it out.
Argo
400200901_21_a
Nehehe!
Argo
400200901_20_a
You! Go away, NOW!
You'll never know! NEVER!
Asuna
400200901_19_a
Hey, no fair!
Let me in here!
What're we talking about?
Kirito
400200901_18_a
Ahh!!!
A-Argo!
N-No! It's not like that!
Asuna
400200901_17_a
Ya got ta spend a nice, looong
time with Kii-boy, huh? Have fun?
Argo
400200901_16_a
Yes? Why are we whispering all of
a sudden...?
Asuna
400200901_15_a
Aww, ya guys! Yer so sweet!
Thanks, kiddos!
'Sides... Ahem, hey, Asu...
Argo
400200901_14_a
Besides, we had to try it. After all,
if Argo says it's worth checking
out, it's worth checking out.
Kirito
400200901_13_a
And there still might be some
sort of important info, item,
or quest lurking around in there.
Asuna
400200901_12_a
Having an excuse to go there and
see it, well, it was fun...
Asuna
400200901_11_a
Yeah, I agree. We found an area in
a previously completed floor that
no one had been to yet.
Asuna
400200901_10_a
Even if it's unrelated to beating
the game, the truth is we still
got to explore somewhere new.
Kirito
400200901_9_a
No, I think your instincts were on
the money. We should check out any
similar quests in the future.
Kirito
400200901_8_a
Maybe I was just worryin' too
much 'bout nothin'?
Argo
400200901_7_a
Hmm, that's pretty lame...
It smelled fishy, so my Argo alert
was blarin' like crazy...
Argo
400200901_6_a
We didn't learn anything valuable
either.
Asuna
400200901_5_a
But despite how tough it was,
the reward wasn't anything special
at all.
Asuna
400200901_4_a
Asuna
400200901_3_a
One campaign quest complete.
Cue the victory fanfare!
Kirito
400200901_2_a
bg_08_calmdead
Hey hey! 'Sup, Kii-boy, Asu!
How'd it go?
Argo
400200901_1_a
Yeah.
Let's give her the full report.
Asuna
400200802_20_a
So, shall we head back?
Oh yeah! I've got to message Argo!
Kirito
400200802_19_a
E-Exactly!
Asuna
400200802_18_a
Be that as it may, it also shows
a complete lack of empathy.
We could've died back there!
Kirito
400200802_17_a
Kirito...
Asuna
400200802_16_a
That's why I kind of get why we
couldn't just equip the dagger
and kill it right off the bat.
Kirito
400200802_15_a
Well, yeah... I guess...
Asuna
400200802_14_a
You'd be really upset, right?
Kirito
400200802_13_a
What if you spent hours making a
nice meal, and then someone just
wolfed it down without tasting it?
Kirito
400200802_12_a
He'd be...sad?
Asuna
400200802_11_a
I bet the designer would be sad we
didn't really enjoy it.
Kirito
400200802_10_a
A lot of effort was put into
designing this quest. If we took
the shortest route to winning,
Kirito
400200802_9_a
Huh? What are you talking about?
Asuna
400200802_8_a
Well, it was likely Kayaba...
But whatever other reasons he had,
he really put his heart into it.
Kirito
400200802_7_a
He's probably laughing at us right
now! Does he think it's funny if
we die?!
Asuna
400200802_6_a
Seriously! What was up with that?!
Kayaba designed this, didn't he?!
Asuna
400200802_5_a
Yeah. I really panicked for a
moment when I couldn't use that
dagger.
Kirito
400200802_4_a
Phew... We did it.
Asuna
400200802_3_a
Asuna
400200802_2_a
bg_02_dungeon_boss_dark
That's the last we'll see of
Illfang. I think the quest's over.
Kirito
400200802_1_a
Kirito
400200801_34_a
After him!
Asuna
400200801_33_a
What?!
He's running!
Kirito
400200801_32_a
That's a howl of pain if I ever
heard one...
Kirito
400200801_31_a
Kirito
400200801_30_a
bg_02_dungeon_boss
You got him!
Asuna
400200801_29_a
bg_black
Kirito
400200801_28_a
Asuna
400200801_27_a
Haaaaaaaah!
Kirito
400200801_26_a
item_event_400200_knife
Alright, it's equipped!
Kirito
400200801_25_a
You're kidding me!
I'm gonna kill the person who
designed that!
Asuna
400200801_24_a
I guess they wanted us to know how
tough this guy was first! It's
pretty common in games like this!
Kirito
400200801_23_a
Why in the world would they
program in something so idiotic!
Asuna
400200801_22_a
I guess it was programmed so
you can't equip it until the
battle starts!
Kirito
400200801_21_a
Wait... WHAT?!
Asuna
400200801_20_a
Wait, what?
Alright! I can equip the dagger!
Kirito
400200801_19_a
Urk! Illfang snuck up on us while
we were messing around with menus!
Kirito
400200801_18_a
Ahhh!
Asuna
400200801_17_a
No! Asuna! Look out!
Kirito
400200801_16_a
B-But why?!
Asuna
400200801_15_a
B-Beats me...
But I can't equip it...
Kirito
400200801_14_a
...Wait, what? What is this?
Why is the Draconic Dagger locked?
Asuna
400200801_13_a
Oh, shut up about your comfort
zone! Move over!
Asuna
400200801_12_a
Ah! Y-You're definitely invading
my comfort zone here...
Kirito
400200801_11_a
Let me see your window!
I'll do it myself!
Asuna
400200801_10_a
What do you mean, "but"?!
We don't have time for this!
Asuna
400200801_9_a
But...
Kirito
400200801_8_a
Stop wasting time!
Here he comes!
Asuna
400200801_7_a
Umm, it's just that... Well...
Kirito
400200801_6_a
H-Hey!
What are you doing?!
Asuna
400200801_5_a
Wait... What?
Kirito
400200801_4_a
I see it!
Kirito
400200801_3_a
Kirito
400200801_2_a
bg_02_dungeon_boss
There it is, Kirito!
The Kobold Lord!
Asuna
400200801_1_a
Huh...?
Kirito
400200701_19_a
L-Liz!
What are you saying?!
Stop it!
Asuna
400200701_18_a
Heh, you two really get along
well, huh? Looks like I got
nothing to worry about.
Liz
400200701_17_a
Yeah!
Asuna
400200701_16_a
Yeah. You're right!
We'll give him an epic smackdown!
And the first hit's for Diavel.
Kirito
400200701_15_a
Our levels are higher now, and
we're stronger. Buffed or not,
we can take him.
Asuna
400200701_14_a
The past won't repeat itself this
time. We've changed.
Asuna
400200701_13_a
Diavel was destined to be the
leader of the Assault Team,
and we lost him...
Kirito
400200701_12_a
We paid a heavy price for that
victory.
Kirito
400200701_11_a
I'm with you there.
That first boss we fought...
A lot happened back then.
Asuna
400200701_10_a
That's right. Illfang the Kobold
Lord. I would've been happy never
to see his ugly face again.
Kirito
400200701_9_a
The boss is a stronger version of
Floor 1's boss, right?
Asuna
400200701_8_a
So we're almost done with the
quest.
Asuna
400200701_7_a
Oh, awesome!
We finally know where the boss is!
Kirito
400200701_6_a
Alright, we've got the Draconic
Dagger! And, as expected, here's
new info on what to do next.
Kirito
400200701_5_a
Thanks, Liz!
Asuna
400200701_4_a
Asuna
400200701_3_a
Kirito
400200701_2_a
item_event_400200_knife
bg_07_lisbeth_smith_work
Here you go!
One dagger, as ordered!
Liz
400200701_1_a
Okay, let me grab my hammer
and give it a go!
Liz
400200601_24_a
Ha ha, yeah! Exactly like that!
Kirito
400200601_23_a
Ah, I get it! Like "Use the Sphere
of Light, young warriors! Only it
can overcome the demon's magic!"
Liz
400200601_22_a
No, actually. But this is a key
item for weakening the monster's
defenses. We don't need the skill.
Kirito
400200601_21_a
So one of you has the throwing
skill, right?
Liz
400200601_20_a
That seems to be the case.
Asuna
400200601_19_a
Yeaaah, this thing. If I recall,
this feather makes a dagger with a
bonus against a specific monster.
Liz
400200601_18_a
Of course, right here.
Asuna
400200601_17_a
Yuppity yup, no problem! You have
everything else I need, right?
Liz
400200601_16_a
So back to the topic at hand,
we need you to make us a throwing
knife out of this feather.
Kirito
400200601_15_a
Yeesh... Fine.
Kirito
400200601_14_a
Yeah! Shoo, go away!
Asuna
400200601_13_a
Hey! None of your business!
Shoo! Go sit in the corner!
Liz
400200601_12_a
Umm, hate to interrupt, but what
are you two whispering about?
Kirito
400200601_11_a
but he somehow keeps meeting all
these other girls.
Where does he find them?
Asuna
400200601_10_a
I mean, this dummy here is a
total introverted blockhead,
Asuna
400200601_9_a
Worried about what?
Liz
400200601_8_a
I know, but...
I'm getting kinda worried here...
Asuna
400200601_7_a
Whoa whoa whoa, Asuna! What's
with the uber sigh attack? I
told you I got your back, right?
Liz
400200601_6_a
O-Oh yeah, that's right...
sigh
Asuna
400200601_5_a
Ah ha ha, yeah!
I had a great time with you back
on good ol' Floor 55!
Liz
400200601_4_a
Asuna
400200601_3_a
Hey, Liz, it's been a while...
Actually, not that long, right?
Kirito
400200601_2_a
bg_07_lisbeth_smith
Well, look who we got here.
Liz
400200601_1_a
Thanks, Asuna.
Kirito
400200502_14_a
I second that.
Let me message her.
Asuna
400200502_13_a
In that case, I think our best bet
is to ask Liz for help.
Kirito
400200502_12_a
If we need to make something,
we'll need an NPC blacksmith or
someone with the smithing skill.
Asuna
400200502_11_a
Heeey, look! We unlocked the next
part of the quest! Let's see... We
use this wing to make an item...
Kirito
400200502_10_a
Hmph, is that so?
Oh, I get it now.
Asuna
400200502_9_a
Oh, that's right. You've never met.
She's my beast tamer friend's pet.
Kirito
400200502_8_a
Huh?
Kirito
400200502_7_a
Wait... Who's Pina?
Asuna
400200502_6_a
It just dropped the feather we
needed the moment we found it.
Asuna
400200502_5_a
I know what you mean.
I'd feel bad if I had to hurt
something so similar to Pina.
Kirito
400200502_4_a
Yeah, and I'm really glad we
didn't have to hurt that little
dragon too.
Asuna
400200502_3_a
Asuna
400200502_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_sao
I'm glad we found the item we
needed.
Kirito
400200502_1_a
H-Hey! Where are you going?!
There are monsters around here!
Kirito
400200501_14_a
I'M NOT UPSET!
Asuna
400200501_13_a
What?
Seriously, what's up?
Why are you so upset?
Kirito
400200501_12_a
So that's your only reason, huh?!
In that case, you should've just
quit and started over!
Asuna
400200501_11_a
We already accepted this quest
together, right? I can't just go
back and do it all over again.
Kirito
400200501_10_a
Hey, what's got your feathers all
ruffled?
Kirito
400200501_9_a
So why didn't you just take your
FRIEND on a fun romp through this
dungeon instead of me, huh?
Asuna
400200501_8_a
Nooo reason. Nope.
I'm not glaring at all... HMPH!
Asuna
400200501_7_a
H-Hey, why are you glaring at me
like that?!
Kirito
400200501_6_a
Hrmm...!
Asuna
400200501_5_a
My friend really came through for
us, didn't she, Asuna?
Kirito
400200501_4_a
that little dragon monster appears
somewhere deep in this dungeon.
Kirito
400200501_3_a
Asuna
400200501_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_sao
According to a beast tamer who's
run into that monster before,
Kirito
400200501_1_a
Sure!
Silica
400200401_17_a
That's a great idea, Silica!
Can you do me a favor and ask
around?
Kirito
400200401_16_a
I just thought that one of the
other beast tamers I met there
might know something.
Silica
400200401_15_a
But the person who organized the
event was saying that they'd like
to make one at some point.
Silica
400200401_14_a
No, we haven't formed one yet.
Silica
400200401_13_a
Wait, what's that? Like a guild?
Kirito
400200401_12_a
I went to a beast tamer meetup the
other day...
Silica
400200401_11_a
Hmm? What is it?
Kirito
400200401_10_a
Oh...now that I think about it...
Silica
400200401_9_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
400200401_8_a
Pina, are you trying to console
me? Thank you...
Silica
400200401_7_a
Chirp...
Pina
400200401_6_a
Compared to someone on the Assault
Team, I mean. I'm nowhere near as
smart or skilled as they are...
Silica
400200401_5_a
Th-That's not true!
I really don't know anything...
Silica
400200401_4_a
I see...
Well, if you've never heard of it,
that must mean it's really rare.
Kirito
400200401_3_a
Kirito
400200401_2_a
bg_04_inn_restaurant
Sorry...
I've never seen a dragon that
looks like this before.
Silica
400200401_1_a
Oh, I almost forgot!
So there's this dragon...
Kirito
400200301_20_a
Ah, nope! Not a word!
So, what was your question?
Silica
400200301_19_a
Huh?
Did you say something?
Kirito
400200301_18_a
(Aww, rats...)
Silica
400200301_17_a
Wh-? O-Oh! Oh...
Th-That makes sense, I guess...
Silica
400200301_16_a
She's on the Assault Team, and
she's pretty famous.
I'm doing the quest with her.
Kirito
400200301_15_a
Anyway, have you heard of a player
named Asuna? She's vice commander
of the Knights of the Blood Oath.
Kirito
400200301_14_a
N-No! Not at all!
Silica
400200301_13_a
Um, yeah.
Is something the matter?
Kirito
400200301_12_a
A p-partner?
You mean, like, just two people?
Alone?!
Silica
400200301_11_a
You can only do it if you have
a partner, and-
Kirito
400200301_10_a
You see, there's this campaign
quest.
Kirito
400200301_9_a
Sure! I don't know if I can help,
but...a-ask away. What's on
your mind, Kirito?
Silica
400200301_8_a
Ha ha, that's good to hear.
So, Silica, there was something
I wanted to ask you.
Kirito
400200301_7_a
I think she's glad to see you!
You did save her life, after all!
Silica
400200301_6_a
Hey, Pina, nice to see you too!
Kirito
400200301_5_a
Chirp!
Pina
400200301_4_a
It has! Sorry for messaging you
out of the blue like that.
Kirito
400200301_3_a
Kirito!
It's been a while!
Silica
400200301_2_a
bg_04_inn_restaurant
Silica, over here!
Kirito
400200301_1_a
Will do!
Kirito
400200202_22_a
She...?
I...see. Sure.
Ask her if she knows anything.
Asuna
400200202_21_a
She's actually got a little dragon
of her own. At the very least,
she knows more about them than me.
Kirito
400200202_20_a
No, not really.
She's a beast tamer.
Kirito
400200202_19_a
An expert...on dragons?
Is he a dragon nerd or something?
Asuna
400200202_18_a
Come to think of it, I have a
friend who's sort of an expert on
the subject. I'll ask about it.
Kirito
400200202_17_a
A tiny dragon... Hmm...
Kirito
400200202_16_a
Hmm... I've never seen anything
like this before...
It looks like a tiny dragon...
Asuna
400200202_15_a
H-Hey, look! This is the monster!
Kirito
400200202_14_a
Really now...
Asuna
400200202_13_a
Nope! No naughtiness here, nuh-uh!
Kirito
400200202_12_a
You weren't thinking of anything
naughty, were you?!
Asuna
400200202_11_a
Hmm... Hey!
Why's your face all red?!
Asuna
400200202_10_a
Ah! You don't have to squeeze in
next to me here! I'll make it
visible, just hold up!
Kirito
400200202_9_a
What sort of mob? Let me see!
Asuna
400200202_8_a
Yeah. The quest's showing me
an image of it in my window.
Kirito
400200202_7_a
Hmm? A mob?
Asuna
400200202_6_a
Next we have to find...this mob.
Then we have to get this item...
Kirito
400200202_5_a
According to the quest info...
Kirito
400200202_4_a
Yeah. On to the next one!
Kirito
400200202_3_a
Kirito
400200202_2_a
bg_event_field
That was an easy one.
Asuna
400200202_1_a
Yeah, let's do it.
Kirito
400200201_22_a
Okay then!
Let's go check it out.
Asuna
400200201_21_a
Hmm, good point... You're right.
It does sound suspicious.
Asuna
400200201_20_a
then I'm sure Argo's dying for
intel about it. Why would he
release new content now?
Kirito
400200201_19_a
If SAO's GM, Kayaba, 
is still tinkering with things,
Kirito
400200201_18_a
having a totally new quest pop up
on a finished floor is almost
unprecedented.
Kirito
400200201_17_a
It's likely that it's a completely
new quest. According to Argo,
Kirito
400200201_16_a
It's not uncommon for quests to
trigger events on other floors,
but this is different.
Kirito
400200201_15_a
Wait, that's it?
A new quest on a finished floor?
Isn't that pretty normal?
Asuna
400200201_14_a
Yeah, about that... Apparently,
this quest just appeared on a
floor we've already beaten.
Kirito
400200201_13_a
Argo wouldn't have us doing some
pointless side quest, right?
There's got to be more to this.
Asuna
400200201_12_a
Okay, sure. But why are we
bothering with this quest at all?
Asuna
400200201_11_a
That'll cause the Floor 66 event
boss to appear.
Kirito
400200201_10_a
We'll have to do a bunch of
smaller events first.
Kirito
400200201_9_a
It's actually pretty similar to
what we have to do to unlock a
floor's boss.
Kirito
400200201_8_a
The quest, right...
It's a multi-stage affair.
Looks to be fairly bulky.
Kirito
400200201_7_a
So anyway, what's this quest you
want me to help out on?
Asuna
400200201_6_a
Well, I am, but... Um, if Argo's
asking, I can't say no!
Asuna
400200201_5_a
Y-Yeah, but I assumed you were
too busy with your guild...
Kirito
400200201_4_a
You invited me!
Asuna
400200201_3_a
Asuna
400200201_2_a
bg_08_calmdead
Whoa... You actually came!
Kirito
400200201_1_a
Kii-boy, yer the best!
I could kiss ya!
Argo
400200101_23_a
But first, give me some more info
on this quest, okay?
Kirito
400200101_22_a
Yeah, now it's making more sense.
Well, I assume Asuna will say no,
but I'll ask anyway.
Kirito
400200101_21_a
Ya get why I asked ya now?
Argo
400200101_20_a
Asu and ya were there when he went
down, so I thought ya'd be perfect
fer this particular quest.
Argo
400200101_19_a
Illfang, huh...?
Kirito
400200101_18_a
Yup, that's right. None other than
an uber-buffed Illfang the Kobold
Lord.
Argo
400200101_17_a
Forget it, clueless. I've got a
better reason fer ya. The quest's
boss is Floor 1's biggest baddie.
Argo
400200101_16_a
No way, where'd you get that idea?
Kirito
400200101_15_a
I'm sayin' that she'll do any
quest or anythin', period. Long as
yer doin' the askin', anyway.
Argo
400200101_14_a
Huh...? What are you getting at?
Kirito
400200101_13_a
Ya really believe that?
Argo
400200101_12_a
She doesn't have time for anything
except beating the game.
Kirito
400200101_11_a
O-Oh, uh...we did party once or
twice, but she's the Knights of the
Blood Oath's vice commander now.
Kirito
400200101_10_a
Wow, lookie here! Yer still tryin'
ta play it cool, huh?
Why not just ask Asu, eh?
Argo
400200101_9_a
You do realize that I'm a solo
player too, right?
Kirito
400200101_8_a
I'd rather not have ta party up.
Ya get me?
Argo
400200101_7_a
And as ya know, I'm an info
broker. I don't play well with
others.
Argo
400200101_6_a
Well the thing is, this quest's
made fer two.
Argo
400200101_5_a
What sort of quest?
Actually, wait.
Why do I have to do it?
Kirito
400200101_4_a
I heard 'bout this weird campaign
quest. Wanna check it out fer me?
Argo
400200101_3_a
Argo? What's up?
Kirito
400200101_2_a
bg_08_calmdead
Kii-boy. Hey, Kii-boy!
Argo
400200101_1_a
Oh yeah? Keep at it, then!
Kirito
1850088_15_a
Of course not! I won't rest until
I'm at least as fast as you!
Leafa
1850088_14_a
Ha ha, I'm glad you haven't lost
your motivation.
Kirito
1850088_13_a
I know! That's why I'm gonna stick
with it. It's definitely worth the
trouble.
Leafa
1850088_12_a
It takes a different set of skills
and reflexes compared to flying.
Kirito
1850088_11_a
Of course it has. You actually
have to account for your body's
weight and balance.
Kirito
1850088_10_a
I know, but all of this acrobatic
stuff has been tougher than I
expected.
Leafa
1850088_9_a
You don't have to apologize.
It was just a show for friends.
Kirito
1850088_8_a
Yeah... I'm sorry.
Leafa
1850088_7_a
So you tried to get away with
a little cheat, huh?
Kirito
1850088_6_a
I lost my balance! I'm still not
used to doing this without my
wings.
Leafa
1850088_5_a
I don't think many people noticed,
but I'm pretty sure I caught a
glimpse of your wings.
Kirito
1850088_4_a
Ehehe... Was it that obvious from
the stands?
Leafa
1850088_3_a
Leafa
1850088_2_a
bg_event_circus
You cheated a little bit,
didn't you, Sugu?
Kirito
1850088_1_a
...
Kirito
1850087_39_a
Did it? I didn't see anything.
Yui
1850087_38_a
Yui
1850087_37_a
Kirito
1850087_36_a
Hrm... That looked a little
awkward...
Asuna
1850087_35_a
Hup!
Leafa
1850087_34_a
Asuna
1850087_33_a
Kirito
1850087_32_a
That's our Leafa!
Yui
1850087_31_a
Yui
1850087_30_a
Kirito
1850087_29_a
That was incredible!
She had perfect form!
Asuna
1850087_28_a
YAH!
Leafa
1850087_27_a
sigh
...Hmph!
Leafa
1850087_26_a
Whenever you're ready, Leafa!
Ringmaster
1850087_25_a
Asuna
1850087_24_a
Yui
1850087_23_a
You think? Let's find out!
Kirito
1850087_22_a
Leafa's really good at flying,
so this should be no problem
for her!
Yui
1850087_21_a
Yeah, I thought the same thing.
Okay, Leafa's up next.
Kirito
1850087_20_a
Hmm, moves like that really could
be useful in a VRMMO.
Asuna
1850087_19_a
Wow, there's more to tightrope
walking than I thought!
Asuna
1850087_18_a
And she stuck the landing!
She's got incredible balance!
Asuna
1850087_17_a
Asuna
1850087_16_a
Kirito
1850087_15_a
Oh my gosh! Sinon's jumping around
on that super-thin wire!
Yui
1850087_14_a
Get balanced on the wire, and...
Jump!
Sinon
1850087_13_a
...
Sinon
1850087_12_a
Kirito
1850087_9_a
Take it away!
Ringmaster
1850087_8_a
Yui
1850087_11_a
Asuna
1850087_10_a
Yeah. Sinon will be on the
tightrope, and Leafa's on
the trapeze.
Kirito
1850087_7_a
Sinonon and Leafa are up next!
Asuna
1850087_6_a
Wow! I can't wait!
Yui
1850087_5_a
Kirito
1850087_4_a
Asuna
1850087_3_a
Yui
1850087_2_a
bg_event_circus
And now, for the main event...
Tightrope walking AND flying
trapeze!
Ringmaster
1850087_1_a
Ooh, a show!
Leafa
1850085_20_a
Know what I mean?
Kirito
1850085_19_a
That, or a private show for
friends or something.
Kirito
1850085_18_a
Like some sort of technique you
unlock at the end?
Sinon
1850085_17_a
What do you mean?
Leafa
1850085_16_a
Really? I just can't help but
think it'd be better if there were
something to work toward.
Kirito
1850085_15_a
All I'm saying is, there's a lot
you could learn here.
Sinon
1850085_14_a
Easy, let's not oversell my
advantage.
Kirito
1850085_13_a
He also mastered ground-based
combat in SAO. Your point?
Sinon
1850085_12_a
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
Kirito
1850085_11_a
But he also mastered all the moves
while I was running to catch up
to you two! Right?!
Leafa
1850085_10_a
He did it with you too!
And he's your brother!
Sinon
1850085_9_a
...Also I didn't want to do this
alone.
Leafa
1850085_8_a
Because we got through that circus
quest TOGETHER, Sinon! Come on!
Leafa
1850085_7_a
She dragged me here against my
will.
Sinon
1850085_6_a
Heh heh, Sinon's joining the
circus with me.
Leafa
1850085_5_a
Sinon? Where'd you come from?
Kirito
1850085_4_a
Leafa
1850085_3_a
Kirito
1850085_2_a
bg_02_fountain
Oh, look who it is.
Sinon
1850085_1_a
The fact that you want to improve
says a lot about you.
Kirito
1850083_19_a
I'm sure you're not the only one.
ALO is all about flying, anyway.
Kirito
1850083_18_a
I think I've been flying too much
lately, and letting my ground
skills slip.
Leafa
1850083_17_a
But then we had to chase the
troupe through that forest, and
I was borderline useless!
Leafa
1850083_16_a
I used to think I was pretty good
with aerial stuff, y'know?
Leafa
1850083_15_a
That's performance art for you.
Kirito
1850083_14_a
It's not just about pulling it
off. It has to look graceful
and showy.
Leafa
1850083_13_a
So Sakuya told you, eh?
It's pretty tough!
Leafa
1850083_12_a
Alright, fine. How's your practice
going?
Kirito
1850083_11_a
Relax, I'm the only other player
in this whole town.
Leafa
1850083_10_a
Hey, easy on the "Kazuto," okay?
Kirito
1850083_9_a
Hey! What's up, Kazuto?
Leafa
1850083_8_a
Leafa
1850083_7_a
Oh, there you are.
Kirito
1850083_6_a
Then again, "just a cartwheel" is
no easy feat in real life, either.
Leafa
1850083_5_a
It's actually pretty tough when
you think of it as a performance
technique.
Leafa
1850083_4_a
Whew... To think that was just
a somersault off a cartwheel.
I'm exhausted!
Leafa
1850083_3_a
Success. That's how it's done.
Circus Woman
1850083_2_a
bg_02_fountain
And now I... HAH!
Leafa
1850083_1_a
Got it. Thank you, Sakuya.
I'll go see what she's up to.
Kirito
1850081_15_a
Ha ha, she says their moves could
prove useful in areas where we
cannot fly.
Sakuya
1850081_14_a
Really? She's that interested?
Kirito
1850081_13_a
She mentioned that she wants to
learn how to move like them.
Sakuya
1850081_12_a
Well, it seems she's befriended
them now.
Sakuya
1850081_11_a
Though they did apologize and
agree to come up with some new
techniques.
Kirito
1850081_10_a
Ah, you mean the circus that
tried to clip the wings of every
fairy in Alfheim?
Kirito
1850081_9_a
She said she was going to meet
with the troupe.
Sakuya
1850081_8_a
Oh, it's an event alright. The
circus has made its way there.
Sakuya
1850081_7_a
Is there some sort of event quest
going on there?
Kirito
1850081_6_a
I'd guess she's at the town
between here and Salamander
territory.
Sakuya
1850081_5_a
Oh, okay. Any idea where she went?
Kirito
1850081_4_a
Hey, Kirito. Sorry, she's not even
in Sylvain right now.
Sakuya
1850081_3_a
Sakuya
1850081_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
Sorry to bother you, Sakuya.
Is Leafa around?
Kirito
1850081_1_a
I'm glad to hear you say that!
Suguha
1850058_31_a
I'm glad I got to try archery and
horseback riding, though.
Shino
1850058_30_a
Heh, be that as it may, all of it
was way harder for me in real
life!
Shino
1850058_29_a
Hahaha, quit exaggerating!
Not everyone can pull off what
you just did in GGO!
Suguha
1850058_28_a
It was nothing, really. It's all
about 100 times easier than
doing the same in real life.
Shino
1850058_27_a
You must be pretty good!
Staff Member
1850058_26_a
Your secret is safe with us.
We're just impressed by your
skills in virtual reality!
Staff Member
1850058_25_a
The staff here are the only ones
who know my real-world identity,
though... Can you keep it quiet?
Shino
1850058_24_a
Yes, that was quite thrilling!
Staff Member
1850058_23_a
Looks like using exploding objects
was the right choice in the end!
Suguha
1850058_22_a
No need to thank us.
We're just glad it went well.
Shino
1850058_21_a
Indeed! You've done us a great
service. Thank you both so much.
Staff Member
1850058_20_a
Suguha
1850058_19_a
bg_event_japan_castle
Whew, that went better than
expected.
Shino
1850058_18_a
Such presence! Such power!
This is incredible!
Worshiper
1850058_17_a
Oh, I'm just getting started!
Sinon
1850058_16_a
Whoa!
Worshiper
1850058_15_a
Next up...!
Sinon
1850058_14_a
Ooh!
Worshiper
1850058_13_a
Hmph!
Sinon
1850058_12_a
What? Is something like that even
possible?
Worshiper
1850058_11_a
We hope you enjoy the show!
Staff Member
1850058_10_a
Targets that she shall shoot out
of the sky with her trusty gun!
Staff Member
1850058_9_a
She will ride through the wastes on
her mechanical steed as countless
targets appear before her!
Staff Member
1850058_8_a
bg_s2_09_ruins
Then it's showtime!
Sinon
1850058_7_a
The targets are ready!
Suguha
1850058_6_a
bg_event_japan_castle
A famed sniper from the virtual
world of GGO will now exhibit her
horseback SHOOTING skills!
Staff Member
1850058_5_a
bg_s2_09_ruins
Okay, I'm ready.
Sinon
1850058_4_a
Nonetheless, we have something
special prepared for you. Please
take a look at the large screen.
Staff Member
1850058_3_a
As today's performer has
fallen ill, we will not be able to
proceed as originally planned.
Staff Member
1850058_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
And now, we move on to the
main event, horseback archery.
Staff Member
1850058_1_a
Exactly. I think I can put this
real-world experience to good use.
Shino
1850057_15_a
I think I see where you're going
with this!
Suguha
1850057_14_a
Yeah, I mean they could probably
rent those, but... Ohhh!
Suguha
1850057_13_a
Uhhh...
Suguha
1850057_12_a
Do you think this shrine could
get a big screen and a projector
set up?
Shino
1850057_11_a
Meaning...what, exactly?
Suguha
1850057_10_a
But in reality, sometimes you have
to change your approach instead
of trying to force things.
Shino
1850057_9_a
Shino...?
Suguha
1850057_8_a
I've been taking that to heart
lately. I don't want to regret
anything, you know?
Shino
1850057_7_a
It's okay. I'm the one who agreed
to try it. Failure's guaranteed if
you don't even try...
Shino
1850057_6_a
I'm sorry I asked you to take
all this on.
Suguha
1850057_5_a
Well, nobody expects you to
master both of them overnight.
Suguha
1850057_4_a
...that horse riding of all things
would be the easier part of this?
Shino
1850057_3_a
Suguha
1850057_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
Who would've thought...
Shino
1850057_1_a
Indeed. Take the reins in your
hand and start off with a slow
walk.
Staff Member
1850055_22_a
Ah, no! Nothing at all. I won't
know how well this will go until
we get moving, though.
Shino
1850055_21_a
I'm sorry, did you say something?
Staff Member
1850055_20_a
Does it like me because I'm a
Cait Sith?
Shino
1850055_19_a
It seems as though you have a
good bond with this horse.
Staff Member
1850055_18_a
You're doing well! This might work
after all.
Staff Member
1850055_17_a
I did it...
Shino
1850055_16_a
Shino
1850055_15_a
snort
Horse
1850055_14_a
Suguha
1850055_13_a
I will.
Shino
1850055_12_a
Allow me to explain the proper
technique. The most important
thing is to remain calm.
Staff Member
1850055_11_a
So that's the horse I have to
ride...
Shino
1850055_10_a
NEIGH!
???
1850055_9_a
Are you sure? You needn't push
yourself...
Staff Member
1850055_8_a
Yes. I'd like to try riding on
horseback, even though I'm still
uneasy about my bow skill.
Shino
1850055_7_a
Are you okay, miss?
Staff Member
1850055_6_a
I'm gonna be so sore tomorrow...
Shino
1850055_5_a
I've only shot off a couple of
arrows, but my whole body
hurts already...
Shino
1850055_4_a
Shino...?
Suguha
1850055_3_a
Suguha
1850055_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
Whew...
Shino
1850055_1_a
You can do it, Shino!
Suguha
1850053_22_a
Here, use a training bow first.
That should make it easier.
Staff Member
1850053_21_a
I... I can't. I had no idea this
was so hard in real life.
Shino
1850053_20_a
Are you all right? Can you draw
the string back?
Staff Member
1850053_19_a
Urf! I-It's so heavy...!
Shino
1850053_18_a
I'd like to start with archery.
Shino
1850053_17_a
Would you be able to do both from
the start? Or would you like to
take it one step at a time?
Staff Member
1850053_16_a
Please withdraw if you feel it
is too much at any point.
Staff Member
1850053_15_a
Of course. We would never put a
beginner in danger.
Staff Member
1850053_14_a
Yes, but on the condition that
practice goes well and it looks
like I can do it.
Shino
1850053_13_a
Shino
1850053_12_a
You'll fill in for our horseback
archery performance? Thank you
so much!
Staff Member
1850053_11_a
I will.
Shino
1850053_9_a
Suguha
1850053_10_a
If you ask the staff and they say
it's okay, then please give it a
try!
Suguha
1850053_8_a
Absolutely!
I'm just the messenger.
Suguha
1850053_7_a
If they let me practice and it
doesn't go well, will you let
me off the hook?
Shino
1850053_6_a
That's what I like to hear!
Suguha
1850053_5_a
But I'll give it a shot.
Shino
1850053_4_a
Oh?
Suguha
1850053_3_a
Suguha
1850053_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
I don't know if I can do it...
Shino
1850053_1_a
...
Shino
1850051_17_a
I just thought I could help the
staff out of a jam.
Suguha
1850051_16_a
Sorry I asked too much of you.
Suguha
1850051_15_a
Hmm... Maybe you're right.
Suguha
1850051_14_a
I'm nowhere near as athletic
as you in real life, either.
I can't do it!
Shino
1850051_13_a
Yeah, but that was all in VR,
which isn't reality, in case
you forgot!
Shino
1850051_12_a
But you're a master archer in ALO!
And GGO has mech horses, right?
Suguha
1850051_11_a
Why me?! I've never done archery
for real! I've never even ridden
a real horse!
Shino
1850051_10_a
What?!
Shino
1850051_9_a
Which got me thinking...
What if you filled in?
Suguha
1850051_8_a
They don't have a backup, either.
Suguha
1850051_7_a
Oof. Yeah, that's been going
around lately.
Shino
1850051_6_a
but the performer got the flu
and had to cancel.
Suguha
1850051_5_a
It sounds like this shrine planned
to have a performance tomorrow
to celebrate the new year,
Suguha
1850051_4_a
I don't think so...
Shino
1850051_3_a
Shino
1850051_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
Hey Shino, have you heard about
the horseback archery?
Suguha
1850051_1_a
Yeah! I'm ready!
Sachi
1850048_15_a
Ha ha, you bet! So on that note,
let's get to training!
Kirito
1850048_14_a
Hehe, maybe! But you'll keep me
safe until I'm a dagger master,
right?
Sachi
1850048_13_a
It'll probably take you a while to
get used to them.
Kirito
1850048_12_a
I... see. Well, just be careful.
Daggers feel totally different
from swords or spears.
Kirito
1850048_11_a
But maybe if I face my fears head
on, I won't be so scared anymore.
Sachi
1850048_10_a
I'm not that brave, and I don't
think I'll ever be...
Sachi
1850048_9_a
During our chat the other day, I
realized something: everyone's
struggling with fear, not just me.
Sachi
1850048_8_a
Well, that's exactly why I want
to use it. I thought I could just
force myself, like you do.
Sachi
1850048_7_a
But weren't you having trouble
fighting in close already? The
dagger's only going to be worse...
Kirito
1850048_6_a
I thought I'd try using something
really close-ranged.
Sachi
1850048_5_a
That's a dagger, not a sword!
Kirito
1850048_4_a
Okay... Hey, hold on a sec!
Kirito
1850048_3_a
Kirito
1850048_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Kirito! I want to try using this
for today's training!
Sachi
1850048_1_a
No... Not at all...
Sachi
1850047_25_a
Sorry... I must've sounded pretty
self-important just now...
Kirito
1850047_24_a
...
Sachi
1850047_23_a
I want to live to see tomorrow
and to do that, I've got to fight.
So, I fight.
Kirito
1850047_22_a
When terror's about to overwhelm
you, you just force yourself to
keep moving, you know?
Kirito
1850047_21_a
Hmm...
It's kind of hard to explain...
Kirito
1850047_20_a
Really? How do you deal with it?
Sachi
1850047_19_a
I know my heart starts pounding
when I see a monster, even if it's
just a weak one.
Kirito
1850047_18_a
but I don't think anyone really
conquers their fears and marches
into battle completely unafraid.
Kirito
1850047_17_a
Nope. Maybe the rest of us have
a little more combat experience
under our belts,
Kirito
1850047_16_a
It... isn't?
Sachi
1850047_15_a
It's not like being frightened is
bad, or even unusual.
Kirito
1850047_14_a
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Kirito
1850047_13_a
Kirito, let's be honest.
I'm hopeless.
Sachi
1850047_12_a
So, Sachi... Now that he's gone,
want to get back to training?
Kirito
1850047_11_a
Thanks...
Sachi
1850047_9_a
Keita
1850047_10_a
No worries! Good luck with your
training!
Keita
1850047_8_a
Sorry I can't join the rest of the
guild this time...
Sachi
1850047_7_a
Sure... But I'll swing by again
when I have a minute.
Keita
1850047_6_a
We'll be fine here, so you can get
back to that quest you're working
on.
Kirito
1850047_5_a
No, it's okay. Thanks for trying
to help out.
Kirito
1850047_4_a
Sachi
1850047_3_a
Kirito
1850047_2_a
bg_03_forest1_sunset
So, uh...
Sorry about that.
Keita
1850047_1_a
...
Kirito
1850045_22_a
B-But it's SCARY!
Sachi
1850045_21_a
What are you doing? You're never
going to hit anything from that
far away!
Keita
1850045_20_a
Fine... T-Take that!
And that...I guess.
Sachi
1850045_19_a
Come on, it'll be a breeze!
Smack it in the face with
your sword!
Keita
1850045_18_a
B-But...
Sachi
1850045_17_a
Sachi, we've got a real weak
monster over here! Come get it!
Keita
1850045_16_a
Grawwwrrr!
Monster
1850045_15_a
Sachi
1850045_14_a
Kirito
1850045_13_a
Keita
1850045_12_a
Well, anyway, I'm hanging around
and you can't stop me! Besides,
it'll help! Promise!
Keita
1850045_11_a
Ouch. That was uncalled for.
Keita
1850045_10_a
Yeah, but he counts as, like,
minus seven people.
Sachi
1850045_9_a
Hmm... That's a good idea.
There's safety in numbers.
Kirito
1850045_8_a
In other words...I can't really
help that much! But I can try
to offer moral support.
Keita
1850045_7_a
but you're fighting super under-
leveled mobs already. We can't
lower the difficulty here.
Keita
1850045_6_a
Yeah! I know you're trying to
conquer your fears by fighting
real monsters,
Keita
1850045_5_a
Really? Are you sure?
Sachi
1850045_4_a
Kirito
1850045_3_a
Sachi
1850045_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Alright, you two, I have an idea!
Let's train together!
Keita
1850045_1_a
Sachi...
Kirito
1850043_22_a
Of course I'm scared! Getting
close to a monster is terrifying!
Sachi
1850043_21_a
She always freezes at the worst
possible moment...
Kirito
1850043_20_a
That fear, subconscious or
otherwise, is probably holding
her back.
Kirito
1850043_19_a
It could just be fear holding her
back. It's scary to get up close
and personal with a monster.
Kirito
1850043_18_a
Then...?
Keita
1850043_17_a
Of course, if it's not that...
Kirito
1850043_16_a
Well, it's uncommon, but some
people with eye problems have
trouble perceiving things in VR.
Kirito
1850043_15_a
Yeah...
Sachi
1850043_14_a
Did you have bad eyesight in
the real world, Sachi?
Kirito
1850043_13_a
Your vision might be part of the
problem too. It could be an FNC:
a FullDive Nonconformity.
Kirito
1850043_12_a
Well, to tell you the truth,
I think she's having trouble
unlearning her old habits.
Kirito
1850043_11_a
Kirito, what do you think?
Keita
1850043_10_a
I'm not angry. Hmph.
Sachi
1850043_9_a
Hey Sachi, chill out.
You don't have to get angry...
Keita
1850043_8_a
I know I'm terrible. I can't even
hit anything! I'm just swinging
my sword around like an idiot.
Sachi
1850043_7_a
What part of this is
"pretty good"?
Sachi
1850043_6_a
Oh, uh...
Pretty good, I guess.
Kirito
1850043_5_a
Hi Keita...
Sachi
1850043_4_a
Kirito
1850043_3_a
Sachi
1850043_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Hey you two, how's Sachi's sword
training going?
Keita
1850043_1_a
Yeah... I guess...
Sachi
1850041_17_a
It takes time to get accustomed
to a new weapon, but you'll get
there.
Kirito
1850041_16_a
Yeah, it is. Feels weird in your
hand, huh?
Kirito
1850041_15_a
This weapon's waaay shorter than
a spear...
Sachi
1850041_14_a
First things first: you need to
get used to the length of your
weapon and work on distancing.
Kirito
1850041_13_a
Don't worry about it, okay? You're
still getting used to the sword.
Kirito
1850041_12_a
Y-Yeah... Thanks, Kirito...
Sachi
1850041_11_a
Are you all right, Sachi?
Kirito
1850041_10_a
Ahh!
Sachi
1850041_9_a
Grrrk!
Monster
1850041_8_a
Kirito
1850041_7_a
Uh oh, this looks bad!
Hraaagh!!
Kirito
1850041_6_a
Grawwwrgh!!
Monster
1850041_5_a
C-Closer?!
But I'm already REALLY close!!
Sachi
1850041_4_a
You need to get a little closer,
Sachi!
Kirito
1850041_3_a
Kirito
1850041_2_a
bg_03_forest1
T-Take this!
Sachi
1850041_1_a
Hehe, I like the way you think!
Asuna
1850038_35_a
I need some serious R&R.
Sinon
1850038_34_a
So, now that we don't have to
worry about any perverts anymore,
let's hit the hot springs.
Sinon
1850038_33_a
He did seem sincere about turning
a new leaf, so I think we're fine.
Asuna
1850038_32_a
In return, we don't turn him in.
Buuut we keep the video as
insurance.
Sinon
1850038_31_a
Asuna
1850038_30_a
Well, at least we got a promise
from him never to do it again.
Sinon
1850038_29_a
Leafa
1850038_28_a
Hey, Sinon deserves the thanks
more than any of us! She
planned this whole thing!
Yuuki
1850038_27_a
Sinon
1850038_26_a
For sure! Good teamwork, girls!
Asuna
1850038_25_a
Yuuki
1850038_24_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Phew. That settles that.
Leafa
1850038_23_a
Fine. You win. Do whatever you
want. I don't care.
Peeping Tom
1850038_22_a
...
Peeping Tom
1850038_21_a
So we made sure our plan to catch
you was foolproof.
Sinon
1850038_20_a
We knew you were relatively
cautious.
Asuna
1850038_19_a
...!
Peeping Tom
1850038_18_a
but they blacklist you from ever
diving into ALO again.
Leafa
1850038_17_a
So reality check. We give the devs
this video, and not only do they
ban your account,
Leafa
1850038_16_a
Trying to log out? Too late. We've
been recording this whooole
conversation.
Leafa
1850038_15_a
Urk...!
Peeping Tom
1850038_14_a
Yup! And now-oh, I always wanted
to say this!-you're under arrest,
scumbag!
Yuuki
1850038_13_a
Yuuki
1850038_12_a
Nice to meet you. We're the creep
patrol, and we've had our eye on
you ever since you entered town.
Leafa
1850038_11_a
Huh?!
Peeping Tom
1850038_10_a
Naaah, I wouldn't say that.
???
1850038_9_a
You'll never be able to catch me
or stop me from doing it again!
Ha ha ha!
Peeping Tom
1850038_8_a
Doesn't matter if you got my
mirror! I'm alone on a remote
mountain! No one can find me here!
Peeping Tom
1850038_7_a
Bah! Whatever!
I don't care!
Peeping Tom
1850038_6_a
We'll just be confiscating this
Crescent Moon Mirror.
Asuna
1850038_5_a
Wh-Wh-What the hell?!
Peeping Tom
1850038_4_a
You fell right into our trap,
moron.
Sinon
1850038_3_a
Sinon
1850038_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Nice Moonlight Mirror.
You've been caught red-handed.
Asuna
1850038_1_a
Wh-What the-?!
???
1850037_19_a
item_20_moonlight_mirror02
I just have to use these dark
magic buffs, link a Moonlight
Mirror to that handy item, and...
???
1850037_18_a
Heh heh heh... Finally, my plans
have reached fruition...
???
1850037_17_a
bg_11_forest_yui
...
???
1850037_16_a
Asuna
1850037_15_a
Race you to the water!
Sinon
1850037_14_a
Meanwhile, Sinon and I will check
the hot spring for that magic
mirror!
Asuna
1850037_13_a
Get him for us, girls.
Sinon
1850037_12_a
Yuuki
1850037_11_a
There aren't many players whose
agility stats can compare to
ours! We'll catch him for sure!
Leafa
1850037_10_a
Leafa
1850037_9_a
So, me and Leafa get to go after
him, right?
Yuuki
1850037_8_a
He must have hidden his Crescent
Moon Mirror in there somewhere.
Sinon
1850037_7_a
Removing the guards watching the
baths was the right move. I knew
he'd take the bait. Idiot.
Sinon
1850037_6_a
Creep sighted.
Asuna
1850037_5_a
...!
???
1850037_4_a
Sinon
1850037_3_a
Asuna
1850037_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
...
???
1850037_1_a
Sure, I can take you over there
now.
Agil
1850035_35_a
Good idea. I want to know what
this jerk looks like.
Asuna
1850035_34_a
Agil! I want to talk to the person
who sold this guy those items.
Sinon
1850035_33_a
That means that maybe he hasn't
had time to put them in yet!
Sinon
1850035_32_a
Someone posted anonymously on an
ALO forum about how they were
planning to peep...
Asuna
1850035_31_a
Asuna... What did those rumors
about the peeping Tom say?
Sinon
1850035_30_a
It might still be in there...
Asuna
1850035_29_a
Ahh, I get it. He hid one of them
somewhere to act as his personal
peeping camera. Gross.
Sinon
1850035_28_a
These Crescent Moon Mirrors cost a
bundle, and the guy who bought the
dark magic buffs bought some too.
Agil
1850035_27_a
If you have one of them, you don't
have to be friends with the caster
for them to open up a Mirror.
Agil
1850035_26_a
It's called the Crescent Moon
Mirror.
Agil
1850035_25_a
Yeah, but there's more. Recently,
someone came up with a handy new
item that uses that spell.
Agil
1850035_24_a
No, it isn't that overpowered of a
spell. It only works for people
on your friend list, I think.
Asuna
1850035_23_a
Can you even open up a Moonlight
Mirror from anywhere, to anywhere?
Sinon
1850035_22_a
Just so they can cast Moonlight
Mirror and peep on the girls'
hot spring?
Sinon
1850035_21_a
Wait... You think our peeper is
using these items to buff their
dark magic level...
Sinon
1850035_20_a
Someone bought a boatload of items
that supercharge your dark magic
skill level temporarily.
Agil
1850035_19_a
Well, not long ago...
Agil
1850035_18_a
What about it? It's really
high-level dark magic
not
many people can cast it.
Asuna
1850035_17_a
Exactly.
Agil
1850035_16_a
It opens up a sort of two-way
mirror that lets you see and talk
to someone, right?
Sinon
1850035_15_a
Yeah. Alicia told me about it.
Sinon
1850035_14_a
You guys heard of the high-level
dark spell, Moonlight Mirror?
Agil
1850035_13_a
What sort of story?
Asuna
1850035_12_a
I'm not finished yet. I heard a
strange little story from a friend
of mine just now.
Agil
1850035_11_a
Then... How is that peeping Tom
spying on us...?
Sinon
1850035_10_a
Yeah, that makes sense...
Asuna
1850035_9_a
Yeah. The devs aren't going to
add an item to the game that could
be misused like that.
Agil
1850035_8_a
You're sure?
Sinon
1850035_7_a
In simple terms, those sorts of
items don't even exist in ALO.
Agil
1850035_6_a
We owe you one. So, what did
you learn?
Sinon
1850035_5_a
Agil, thank you so much!
Asuna
1850035_4_a
Sinon
1850035_3_a
Asuna
1850035_2_a
bg_21_alne
Sorry for the wait. I asked some
merchant friends of mine for the
info you wanted.
Agil
1850035_1_a
Can you tell me if any of the
following items have been made
or sold recently?
Sinon
1850033_20_a
Yeah. I think I said that.
Agil
1850033_19_a
You're here to do some shopping,
right?
Sinon
1850033_18_a
Cool. What do you need?
Agil
1850033_17_a
Perfect timing, Agil. You're just
the person I was looking for.
Sinon
1850033_16_a
Asuna
1850033_15_a
Yo. You guys here to shop too?
Agil
1850033_14_a
Oh, hi Agil!
Asuna
1850033_13_a
Well, look who it is.
???
1850033_12_a
Oh...kay.
Asuna
1850033_11_a
Maybe even the next mountain over.
He'd need a tool, but it's worth
considering.
Sinon
1850033_10_a
So if this creep exists, he has
to be peeping from far away...
Sinon
1850033_9_a
Yeah. I went over every inch of
that mountain a dozen times,
but found no trace of him.
Sinon
1850033_8_a
Hmm... You think the peeper might
be using one?
Asuna
1850033_7_a
I came to see if anyone's selling
telescopes or binoculars.
Sinon
1850033_6_a
I hear that people in this town
deal in all sorts of helpful
player items.
Sinon
1850033_5_a
Then why are you way out here?
The hot springs are nowhere near
here.
Asuna
1850033_4_a
That's right.
Sinon
1850033_3_a
Sinon
1850033_2_a
bg_21_alne
Sinonon... You're trying to catch
that peeping Tom, right?
Asuna
1850033_1_a
...
Sinon
1850031_17_a
If you can't see anyone, then I
doubt there's anyone out there...
Besides, it was just a rumor.
Asuna
1850031_16_a
Sinonon, we've got a full view of
the mountain, and your Cait Sith
eyesight's the best there is.
Asuna
1850031_15_a
Hmm... I don't see anyone...
Sinon
1850031_14_a
That's a secondary concern right
now! If there's a peeper, I'm
going to MURDER him!
Sinon
1850031_13_a
S-Sinonon! Sit down! If someone
is peeking, you're showing it
all off!
Asuna
1850031_12_a
Grrr, if anyone even THINKS
about peeking, I'll-!
Sinon
1850031_11_a
WHAT?!
Sinon
1850031_10_a
Supposedly, someone spotted some
guy players trying to sneak a peek
into this hot spring...
Asuna
1850031_9_a
Right. Lay it on me.
Sinon
1850031_8_a
Ahh, good point. So, random
change of subject, but I heard
a weird rumor recently...
Asuna
1850031_7_a
But here in VR, it's easy to just
find a place and hop in. It's all
about convenience.
Sinon
1850031_6_a
It's not easy to get out and go
to a hot spring resort in the real
world.
Sinon
1850031_5_a
I wouldn't say I'm as obsessed as
you are, but I could definitely do
this every day.
Sinon
1850031_4_a
Hehe, you've become a slave to
the hot spring goodness too,
huh, Sinonon?
Asuna
1850031_3_a
Asuna
1850031_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Mmm, that's some nice hot spring
action right there.
Sinon
1850031_1_a
Aw, you're just saying that.
Leafa
1850018_23_a
You're right, Leafa. We can think
of something!
Liz
1850018_22_a
I just know we can use these shoes
to win, somehow. Let's keep
working on it!
Leafa
1850018_21_a
Well, don't give up yet, Liz!
Leafa
1850018_20_a
...
Leafa
1850018_19_a
Yeah. They've got a pretty unique
look to them, so people are bound
to notice pretty quick.
Liz
1850018_18_a
So if the other players see 'em,
they'll just debuff them and poof!
Enchantment gone?
Leafa
1850018_17_a
Firstly, I can't make that many.
Also, this footgear...can be
debuffed.
Liz
1850018_16_a
What?
Leafa
1850018_15_a
Um, about that...
Liz
1850018_14_a
Awesome! Then let's make a pair
for everyone on our team!
We'll be unstoppable!
Leafa
1850018_13_a
Meaning these rare shoes are
totally NOT in violation!
Liz
1850018_12_a
No, I think the devs knew what
they were doing by leaving out
any mention of footwear.
Liz
1850018_11_a
You're right! I wonder if they
just forgot, or...?
Leafa
1850018_10_a
See? There's nothing in this
rulebook about what kind of
SHOES you can equip!
Liz
1850018_9_a
Alright, alright, I'll read it
again... Hmmm... Oh!
Leafa
1850018_8_a
Mais non, silly Leafa! Take
another look at the rules, and
read veeery carefully this time!
Liz
1850018_7_a
And I'm pretty sure I didn't see
that item name anywhere...
Leafa
1850018_6_a
Wait--we can't use any equipment
not on the list, remember?
Leafa
1850018_5_a
Not only do they look good, they
increase your speed by a ton!
The white team should use these!
Liz
1850018_4_a
Ooh! Look at those gorgeous white
feathers... Those are some nice
shoes!
Leafa
1850018_3_a
Leafa
1850018_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
Check this out! It's a rare item
called "Heaven's Flight."
Liz
1850018_1_a
Uh... Liz?
Leafa
1850017_20_a
Sorry, Leafa! Give me some time
to look into this before I tell
you!
Liz
1850017_19_a
I don't want to get your hopes
up just yet.
Liz
1850017_18_a
What is?
Leafa
1850017_17_a
Wait! That's it!
Liz
1850017_16_a
...
Liz
1850017_15_a
Ah, here we go: "You must select
head, body, and arm equipment
from the types listed below."
Leafa
1850017_14_a
I know, I read that in the
rulebook. What did it say again...
Leafa
1850017_13_a
But the equipment was decided in
advance of the competition. We're
only allowed to use a few types.
Liz
1850017_12_a
There are other ways to buff your
stats without magic though, right?
Leafa
1850017_11_a
Then we're right back where we
started! Grrr...
Liz
1850017_10_a
If you think about it in terms of
the time lost, it's better to just
run like normal.
Leafa
1850017_9_a
Meaning while you're busy casting
the spell, your opponent has
already pulled way ahead.
Liz
1850017_8_a
And you can only cast buffs once
a match has started...
Liz
1850017_7_a
Not during time-sensitive events
like races or tug-o-war.
Leafa
1850017_6_a
It just doesn't seem like there
will be enough time to cast a
buff on yourself.
Leafa
1850017_5_a
I'm out of ideas...
Leafa
1850017_4_a
Now what do we do...
Liz
1850017_3_a
Liz
1850017_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
Y-Yeah...
Leafa
1850017_1_a
Rats... You sure?
Liz
1850015_16_a
sigh
Unfortunately, I don't
think so...
Leafa
1850015_15_a
I don't want an apology! I was
only wondering if we can really
pull this buff strategy off...
Liz
1850015_14_a
S-Sorry, Liz...
Leafa
1850015_13_a
It didn't work, did it?
Liz
1850015_12_a
Grrr... Well, I can't say I'm NOT
glad we gave this a test run
first...
Leafa
1850015_11_a
phew
How was that?
White Team Player
1850015_10_a
I hope I'll be able to catch
up...!
Leafa
1850015_9_a
Hey! I didn't say "go" yet! Ugh,
it's harder than I thought to run
AND cast spells at the same time.
Leafa
1850015_8_a
Catch me if you can!
White Team Player
1850015_7_a
Ready... Set...
Liz
1850015_6_a
Alright--let's do this.
Liz
1850015_5_a
Got it.
White Team Player
1850015_4_a
Yep. I'll cast a spell to buff
myself and chase after you.
Leafa
1850015_3_a
Leafa
1850015_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
So I should just run like normal,
right?
White Team Player
1850015_1_a
Yeah, great idea! That'll help us
be more prepared for the real
deal!
Leafa
1850013_18_a
Hehe, then we better get the white
team together and practice our
buffing spells.
Liz
1850013_17_a
Exactly! Red and white CAN win by
using magic to make up for
athletic ability!
Leafa
1850013_16_a
It won't matter how low your
base stats are if you can buff
them up!
Liz
1850013_15_a
No way, really? That's gonna make
things way easier!
Liz
1850013_14_a
Did you know that we're allowed to
cast buffs on ourselves for this
competition?
Leafa
1850013_13_a
I wouldn't say I'm "skilled," not
compared to you... But we do
have a lot of support players.
Liz
1850013_12_a
Red and white both have a lot of
skilled magic users.
Leafa
1850013_11_a
Yeah, I noticed too--what Asuna,
you, and I share in common.
Leafa
1850013_10_a
You may be right... Wait! Unless
there's something else red and
white have that we're not seeing!
Liz
1850013_9_a
Do red and white even have a
chance at victory here?
Leafa
1850013_8_a
But these teams are definitely
not balanced at all.
Leafa
1850013_7_a
You'd think they'd try and make
the teams as even as possible
for a more exciting contest.
Leafa
1850013_6_a
I knew it... But the devs are the
ones who drew up these teams.
Leafa
1850013_5_a
Like you said earlier, blue and
yellow seem poised to leave red
and white in the dust.
Liz
1850013_4_a
If we're talking pure athletic
ability, we're pretty much done
for.
Liz
1850013_3_a
Leafa
1850013_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
I just checked on all the other
team rosters...
Liz
1850013_1_a
You're right!
Leafa
1850011_20_a
Where there's a will, there's a
way! Let's think of the things
we CAN do.
Liz
1850011_19_a
That'll make coming up with
counter strategies almost
impossible...
Leafa
1850011_18_a
But we don't know which player
the other teams are going to have
compete in which events.
Leafa
1850011_17_a
We better come up with some sort
of strategy if we're gonna have
any hope of winning.
Leafa
1850011_16_a
Yeesh...
Liz
1850011_15_a
They're all kinda...average.
Leafa
1850011_14_a
You're right. I had a peek at
the stats of the other white
team members just now...
Leafa
1850011_13_a
but judging from our split,
it seems like yellow and blue
are the strongest contenders.
Liz
1850011_12_a
Hmm... I'm not sure where the
other veteran players ended up,
Liz
1850011_11_a
...and Silica, Sinon, and Yuuki
are on yellow.
Leafa
1850011_10_a
Asuna and Yui are on red, Kirito
and the boys are on blue...
Liz
1850011_9_a
Yeah... All of our friends, spread
out over four teams.
Liz
1850011_8_a
Hehe, of course we will! But it's
kind of sad everyone got split up.
Leafa
1850011_7_a
Yeah, go white team! I just know
we'll win!
Liz
1850011_6_a
Mind reader! We're on the same
team and all, so let's give it
everything we got!
Leafa
1850011_5_a
Oh, me too! I bet I know what it
is: the ALO sports day, right?
Liz
1850011_4_a
Hey Liz, perfect timing!
There's something I wanted to
talk to you about.
Leafa
1850011_3_a
Leafa
1850011_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
Leafa!
Liz
1850011_1_a
Alright, everybody, prepare to
be blown away!!
Nanairo
1840118_26_a
Nijika
1840118_25_a
Kazuto
1840118_24_a
Great! Now, what to sing...?
Aha, this one!
Nanairo
1840118_23_a
Klein
1840118_22_a
You can pick the track from that
screen there.
Agil
1840118_21_a
Nijika
1840118_20_a
Heh, I'll think about it.
So, what songs you got
loaded up in this gizmo?
Nanairo
1840118_19_a
Oof, really?
Do you accept Yuld...?
Kazuto
1840118_18_a
Nijika
1840118_17_a
Kazuto
1840118_16_a
Ugh, fine! But I demand payment
from all of you for the privilege,
and it isn't going to be cheap!
Nanairo

Agil
1840118_14_a
Come on, Seven! Get up there!
We want to hear your heavenly
voice!
Klein
1840118_13_a
In other words, no excuses!
You can do it!
Nijika
1840118_12_a
You heard how I rearranged the
others, so you'll figure it out.
Nijika
1840118_11_a
It's mostly covers of Christmas
songs, so you should know pretty
much all of them!
Nijika
1840118_10_a
Former pro! Besides, I have no
idea what sort of music you have
queued up...
Nanairo
1840118_9_a
Actually, you know what, that's
not a bad idea! I'm sure everyone
would love to hear a pro tonight!
Nijika
1840118_8_a
What do you mean?
Nanairo
1840118_7_a
Hey, I've got a great idea! While
tonight's star is on break, how
about you sing us a tune, Nanairo?
Kazuto
1840118_6_a
Hey, no pro tips from the
audience, please!
Nijika
1840118_5_a
Boo! No breaks! A real pro doesn't
stop till the night's over!
Nanairo
1840118_4_a
Kazuto
1840118_3_a
Nanairo
1840118_2_a
bg_16_pub
Phew! I think I sung my heart out!
Sorry, everyone, but it's time for
a quick break!
Nijika
1840118_1_a
Ha ha, I'm glad to hear it.
Kazuto
1840117_17_a
So seeing my sister this happy
makes today's concert a huge
success in my eyes.
Nanairo
1840117_16_a
Buuut it looks like she's having
a great time. I haven't seen her
smile this much in forever.
Nanairo
1840117_15_a
Ouch. Brutal.
Kazuto
1840117_14_a
She needs to practice her singing
more, and the sound quality of
the equipment in here sucks.
Nanairo
1840117_13_a
Don't patronize me. I'm a former
pro. But to be brutally honest,
she still has a long way to go.
Nanairo
1840117_12_a
Ha ha, that's our Nanairo.
Sober and precise analysis.
Kazuto
1840117_11_a
I would say it's different from
my recent musical exploits,
but I like it just the same.
Nanairo
1840117_10_a
We were all dignified and holy and
stuff. This is super bouncy pop
music, and way more fun.
Nanairo
1840117_9_a
Completely different from my
Concert of the Carols, that's for
sure.
Nanairo
1840117_8_a
So, how's your sister's concert
so far, Nanairo?
Kazuto
1840117_7_a
Kazuto
1840117_6_a
...
Nanairo
1840117_5_a
NIJIKA! WE LOVE YOU!!
Rika
1840117_4_a
Rika
1840117_3_a
WOOO! ME! ME! I AM!!
Klein
1840117_2_a
bg_16_pub
Who's ready for
the next song?!
Nijika
1840117_1_a
So that's what was going on...
Nanairo
1840115_25_a
Nanairo
1840115_24_a
Kazuto
1840115_23_a
Well, looks like everyone's here!
Sorry, Nanairo! We swore to Nijika
that we'd keep it a secret from you.
Asuna
1840115_22_a
Shut up, Klein.
Agil
1840115_21_a
Yeah! This place is a dump!
Klein
1840115_20_a
Klein
1840115_19_a
Heh, you didn't have to take it so
seriously. This place is a dump,
so just relax and have fun.
Agil
1840115_18_a
Yup! I was rehearsing like crazy!
It IS my first real concert, after
all. I wanted to do it right.
Nijika
1840115_17_a
Kazuto
1840115_16_a
So...you were busy getting ready
for this?
Nanairo
1840115_15_a
Besides, I thought a Christmas
concert would be pretty great,
and better yet, you're here too!
Nijika
1840115_14_a
Yup! Agil said I could use his
place a while back, so I finally
took him up on the offer!
Nijika
1840115_13_a
Kazuto
1840115_12_a
What?! THIS is your first concert?
Here?! Now?!
Nanairo
1840115_11_a
Welcome, Nana, to my first ever
official concert!
Nijika
1840115_10_a
Kazuto
1840115_9_a
Whoa! What's going on?!
Nanairo
1840115_8_a
Nijika set this all up?
But...to do what...?
Nanairo
1840115_7_a
She decided that this was the
perfect opportunity to finally
do it!
Kazuto
1840115_6_a
Yup! When your sister heard the
great Dr. Arshavin was here in
Japan on business...
Kazuto
1840115_5_a
Agil, really? My favorite barista?
Nanairo
1840115_4_a
That makes sense.
It's Agil's cafe, after all.
Kazuto
1840115_3_a
Kazuto
1840115_2_a
bg_16_pub
This place seems familiar,
somehow...
Nanairo
1840115_1_a
You're busted! Now out with it!
Seven
1840113_19_a
Rats... I totally forgot about
that...
Kirito
1840113_18_a
You know I've been researching
how to detect lies in here!
Seven
1840113_17_a
Besides, you think you can fib to
me in VR and get away with it?
Seven
1840113_16_a
Liar! You're panicking, and it's
totally obvious!
Seven
1840113_15_a
I'm not hiding anything!
Cross my heart.
Kirito
1840113_14_a
I, uh, have no idea what you're
talking about.
Kirito
1840113_13_a
That confirms it! You're in on
whatever it is she's trying to
keep secret! Spill! SPILL!!
Seven
1840113_12_a
B-But...why...?
Kirito
1840113_11_a
Hmmm... Yeah, you're hiding
something. What do you know?!
Seven
1840113_10_a
She's training to be a singer.
That's a lot of work.
Kirito
1840113_9_a
Well, Rain's pretty busy in real
life, right?
Kirito
1840113_8_a
Sarcasm detected. What's the deal,
why aren't you agreeing with me?!
Seven
1840113_7_a
R-Right. The fiend.
Kirito
1840113_6_a
That sounded fishy to me, but when
I asked what she was doing, she
said it was a secret! The nerve!
Seven
1840113_5_a
she said she was "busy."
Seven
1840113_4_a
Totally. When I was yelling at her
about how she didn't come to my
concert,
Seven
1840113_3_a
Seven
1840113_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Rain's acting weird?
Kirito
1840113_1_a
Sssh! There are people around!
We're supposed to keep the fact
that we're sisters a secret!
Rain
1840111_19_a
Oh, I am SO angry at you right
now! Spill the beans, or we're
no longer sisters!
Seven
1840111_18_a
...A secret?
Rain
1840111_17_a
Kinda sorta...what?
Seven
1840111_16_a
Umm... Kinda sorta...
Rain
1840111_15_a
Busy? Doing what?
Seven
1840111_14_a
S-Sorry, sheesh... I did send you
a text apologizing, though.
I was busy...
Rain
1840111_13_a
That doesn't count! Ugh! You were
supposed to come see me in person!
I gave you a ticket, didn't I?!
Seven
1840111_12_a
I, uh...
Watched the video afterward?
Rain
1840111_11_a
Kirito and Asuna came!
Where were you?!
Seven
1840111_10_a
Anyway, forget that! I've got
a bone to pick with you! Why
didn't you come to my concert?!
Seven
1840111_9_a
Yeah, yeah. Rub it in.
Rain
1840111_8_a
Well, duh? I've been popular since
way before my caroling exploits.
Honestly? Everyone loves me.
Seven
1840111_7_a
You're certainly popular, Seven.
Rain
1840111_6_a
Hehe, thanks! Spasiba, guys!
Seven
1840111_5_a
Seven! That event you held the
other day, the Concert of the
Carols?! It was amazing!
Player B
1840111_4_a
Rain
1840111_3_a
Seven
1840111_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Hey look! It's Seven!
Seven!! We love you!!
Player A
1840111_1_a
Ha ha ha!
Kirito
1840088_15_a
Aw, man, Rain!
Why are you so mean?
Seven
1840088_14_a
Quiet, you!
Rain
1840088_13_a
Hee hee! That's right!
Seven
1840088_12_a
Kirito...
Rain
1840088_11_a
And we all made it out
in one piece. Why don't we
call it no harm, no foul?
Kirito
1840088_10_a
If she made so many people
happy, it can't have been
all bad...
Kirito
1840088_9_a
On the other hand...Seven
practically made those old
folks' century when she sang.
Kirito
1840088_8_a
L-Look, I said I was sorry!
Seven
1840088_7_a
But she doesn't get it!
You can't just start singing
like that without thinking!
Rain
1840088_6_a
Ha ha! Just let her be.
Kirito
1840088_5_a
What are you so happy about?
Unbelievable!
Rain
1840088_4_a
Kirito
1840088_3_a
Rain
1840088_2_a
bg_event_festival
Phew! All's well that
ends well, huh?
Seven
1840088_1_a
It's fine, you guys.
Just make a break for it!
Kirito
1840087_30_a
Kirito...I'm sorry!
Rain
1840087_29_a
Heh! I got a better idea!
Let's settle our differences
in Ordinal Scale!
Ordinal Scale Player 1
1840087_28_a
Why, you little...!
Ordinal Scale Player 3
1840087_27_a
You want to talk to her,
you need an appointment.
Kirito
1840087_26_a
I'm this young
lady's bodyguard.
Kirito
1840087_25_a
Who do you think you are?!
Ordinal Scale Player 2
1840087_24_a
Oof!
Ordinal Scale Player 1
1840087_23_a
Out of the way!
Kirito
1840087_22_a
Hey!
Where do you think you're--
Ordinal Scale Player 1
1840087_21_a
I guess you're right...
Seven
1840087_20_a
This crowd is just getting
bigger. This is real life,
you know!
Rain
1840087_19_a
Quiet, you!
We're getting out of here
now, while we still can.
Rain
1840087_18_a
Hi, Rain!
Can't I stay a little bit
longer? Pleeease?!
Seven
1840087_17_a
No!
Look, just let me through!
Rain
1840087_16_a
Aw, c'mon! She was just
getting started. Let her stay!
Ordinal Scale Player 3
1840087_15_a
Sh-She's with me!
And we gotta go home!
Rain
1840087_14_a
Yeah!
Wait your turn, lady!
Ordinal Scale Player 2
1840087_13_a
Hey, watch it!
What's the big idea?
Ordinal Scale Player 1
1840087_12_a
Scuse me! Sorry!
Coming through!
Rain
1840087_9_a
Kirito
1840087_11_a
Seven
1840087_10_a
Eeep!
I'm surrounded!
Seven
1840087_8_a
Let's take a selfie!
Ordinal Scale Player 3
1840087_7_a
Can I get an autograph?!
Ordinal Scale Player 2
1840087_6_a
Whoa!
You're Seven! THE Seven!
Ordinal Scale Player 1
1840087_5_a
Aw, thank you, all!
I'm so happy you're
here to listen!
Seven
1840087_4_a
I just hope the angels in
heaven sing half that good!
Old Man
1840087_3_a
Seven
1840087_2_a
bg_event_festival
Bravo!
You were wonderful!
What a little angel!
Old Lady
1840087_1_a
Sure thing!
Let's do this.
Kirito
1840085_17_a
I knew this would happen!
Kirito, can you help me go
get her out of this mess?
Rain
1840085_16_a
Oh, no... Rain!
They're onto her!
Kirito
1840085_15_a
That's it! She's a scientist,
but she also debuted as a
virtual pop star, didn't she?
???
1840085_14_a
Isn't she that girl genius who
won a prize in the States?
???
1840085_13_a
Hey, doesn't that kid look
familiar?
???
1840085_12_a
If they keep praising her like
that, she's bound to get
carried away...
Rain
1840085_11_a
Bravo, bravo!
Bring the house down, kiddo!
Old Man
1840085_10_a
Rain
1840085_9_a
Ha ha! Here comes the encore!
Kirito
1840085_8_a
I'm sooo happy you like my
singing! I'm gonna make this
next song extra special!
Seven
1840085_7_a
Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen!
Seven
1840085_6_a
Kirito
1840085_5_a
Oh, for the love of...
I can't believe it! She never
listens to a word I say!
Rain
1840085_4_a
Seven's taking the AR stage for that talent show.
Kirito
1840085_3_a
Kirito
1840085_2_a
bg_event_festival
Aha!
There she is!
Rain
1840085_1_a
Is that her...?
Rain
1840083_25_a
We didn't expect to see any
young faces like yours
at this here talent show!
Old Man
1840083_24_a
Oh, my!
Young lady, that
was lovely!
Old Lady
1840083_23_a
Hmmm...?
Kirito
1840083_22_a
La la la...
???
1840083_21_a
I gotta go find her!
Rain
1840083_20_a
Ha ha! Sisters sure don't
mince words, huh?
Kirito
1840083_19_a
Not likely! She might be a
genius, but she's still a
ditz!
Rain
1840083_18_a
Ha ha! She's big enough
to find her way back on
her own, don't you think?
Kirito
1840083_17_a
What if she's gotten lost?
Rain
1840083_16_a
What?!
Kirito
1840083_15_a
Nana--I mean, Seven's--gone!
She just disappeared!
Rain
1840083_14_a
What's wrong, Rain?
Kirito
1840083_13_a
...Nana?!
Aaaaagh!
Rain
1840083_12_a
It must be great to see all
your R&D work paying off with
these guys, right, Nana...?
Rain
1840083_11_a
Yeah.
Kirito
1840083_10_a
Yeah! It's great when older
folks can enjoy new tech
without getting intimidated.
Rain
1840083_9_a
that adults can get into
these kinds of gadgets, too.
Kirito
1840083_8_a
Ha ha. That's true! But it's nice
to see
Kirito
1840083_7_a
But isn't the main draw
with this the Augma's
cutting edge AR tech?
Rain
1840083_6_a
Judging from the age range,
I bet we're in for lots of
golden oldies.
Kirito
1840083_5_a
Wow! You guys were right
about the local talent show.
Kirito
1840083_4_a
Rain
1840083_3_a
Kirito
1840083_2_a
bg_event_festival
La la la laaa!
???
1840083_1_a
Heh heh...
There they go again.
Kirito
1840081_23_a
Of course it was!
Rain
1840081_22_a
Heh heh. Was it that obvious?
Seven
1840081_21_a
Your real name is
already out there online...
Rain
1840081_20_a
Not as a singer. I mean your
real name, real face, and
real job as a scientist!
Rain
1840081_19_a
Oh, relax! I'm already
famous as an idol in ALO,
so what's the problem?
Seven
1840081_18_a
Nana, you can't! It's too
risky! You've gotta protect
your identity.
Rain
1840081_17_a
It sounds like fun!
Maybe I'll give it a try!
Seven
1840081_16_a
Ha ha!
It sure seems like it.
Kirito
1840081_15_a
Ha ha! That's awesome! It must
be one of those local talent
shows they have at festivals.
Rain
1840081_14_a
Yeah! That old guy is belting
out some real folk blues!
Rain
1840081_13_a
Hey! I can hear singing!
Seven
1840081_12_a
Wow. Really? Cool!
Rain
1840081_11_a
and give virtual
concerts on them.
Kirito
1840081_10_a
They're not here today,
but Silica and Liz like to
make stages like that too,
Kirito
1840081_9_a
Yeah. Augmas let you
do things like that.
Kirito
1840081_8_a
That little stage over there
was created with AR, don't
you think?
Rain
1840081_7_a
I'm not sure...
Kirito
1840081_6_a
How come there's a crowd in
that corner of the festival
ground?
Seven
1840081_5_a
Rain
1840081_4_a
Kirito
1840081_3_a
Seven
1840081_2_a
bg_event_festival
chatter
???
1840081_1_a
Ha ha, maybe.
Anyway, let's leave it at that.
Kirito
1840068_29_a
Oh yeah... I guess that was just
the adrenaline? Hehehe...
Leafa
1840068_28_a
You whined a LOT about not wanting
to practice, but apparently you can
swim pretty well after all.
Kirito
1840068_27_a
Oh, come on, more?
What is it this time?
Leafa
1840068_26_a
Oh, and one more thing...
Kirito
1840068_25_a
Hehe, thanks. I appreciate it.
Leafa
1840068_24_a
I was scared for you, but that
doesn't change the fact that you
saved a child. You're the best!
Kirito
1840068_23_a
Huh?! Where did that come from?!
Leafa
1840068_22_a
You were amazing!
I'm proud of you, Sugu!
Kirito
1840068_21_a
Good to hear...
And one more thing...
Kirito
1840068_20_a
Okay! I'll make sure to ask you
before I make any hasty decisions.
Leafa
1840068_19_a
Just promise me you won't do
something like that again, okay?
Kirito
1840068_18_a
No, you don't have to apologize.
You made the right choice.
Sorry I snapped at you.
Kirito
1840068_17_a
Y-Yeah... But I'm sorry I made
you worry, Kazuto.
Leafa
1840068_16_a
You wanted to save her as quickly
as possible, is that it?
Kirito
1840068_15_a
I couldn't have done it without
its help. I was only able to pick
my way through because of it...
Leafa
1840068_14_a
The pool supports OS, so it helped
me judge the waves.
Leafa
1840068_13_a
Yeah, I know, but I had the Augma
on my side.
Leafa
1840068_12_a
I know you're athletic, but you're
a terrible swimmer. What you did
was incredibly dangerous.
Kirito
1840068_11_a
Sugu, I'm proud of you, but you
got lucky. That was too reckless.
Kirito
1840068_9_a
Leafa
1840068_10_a
You're right... Thank you again.
Mother
1840068_8_a
No need for that.
Go be with your daughter.
I'm sure she wants to see you.
Leafa
1840068_7_a
There must be something
I can do to thank you!
Mother
1840068_6_a
That's wonderful!
Leafa
1840068_5_a
A doctor's looking her over now.
They said she seems fine and that
there's nothing to worry about.
Mother
1840068_4_a
I'm just glad she's okay.
Leafa
1840068_3_a
Leafa
1840068_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
Thank you so much!
Thank you so, so much!!
Mother
1840068_1_a
But...I won't give up!!
Leafa
1840067_21_a
gasp
...
I should've taken learning how
to swim more seriously!
Leafa
1840067_20_a
I'm coming!!
Hold on!
Leafa
1840067_19_a
Nngh...
Almost...there...!
Leafa
1840067_18_a
Leafa
1840067_17_a
gasp
gulp
splash
Child
1840067_16_a
R-Right, let's go!
Kirito
1840067_15_a
It's too dangerous to try to swim
through those waves! Come on, kid,
we have to get her out of there!
Lifeguard
1840067_14_a
Tell her to come back right this
instant! Quickly!
Lifeguard
1840067_13_a
You know that girl who just jumped
in?
Lifeguard
1840067_12_a
She must have thought we wouldn't
be able to help in time, but even
so, that's too reckless!
Kirito
1840067_11_a
Sugu's really bad at swimming
too...
Kirito
1840067_10_a
I've got to stop her! We can't
have more people getting hurt!
Lifeguard
1840067_9_a
Don't tell me she's trying
to save that little girl?!
Lifeguard
1840067_8_a
What's wrong, kid?
Hold up, did that girl
just jump in?!
Lifeguard
1840067_7_a
Huh..? Is that...SUGU?!
Kirito
1840067_6_a
And while we're standing here
waiting, that girl's drowning!!
Kirito
1840067_5_a
We stopped it, but it takes a
while for the waves to die down!
Lifeguard
1840067_4_a
Hurry up!!
Why is this taking so long?!
Kirito
1840067_3_a
Kirito
1840067_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
We're stopping the waves now!
Hold on just a little longer!
Lifeguard
1840067_1_a
...!
Leafa
1840065_31_a
Someone, help!
Save my daughter!!
Mother
1840065_30_a
G-Good idea!
Leafa
1840065_29_a
Damn, what do we do?! We can't
save her! I'll tell the lifeguard
to stop the waves!
Kirito
1840065_28_a
But there's a good chance the
surfboard would hit her when
you tried to rescue her...!
Kirito
1840065_27_a
You'd have to surf to get all
the way out there.
Kirito
1840065_26_a
Oh...I see what you mean.
She's way out in the deep end...
Kirito
1840065_25_a
B-But... I can't...
Leafa
1840065_24_a
She must have fallen in! Sugu,
come on! We have to help her!
Kirito
1840065_23_a
H-Heeelp!!!
???
1840065_22_a
A little girl's in the water!
Leafa
1840065_21_a
Kazuto, look!
Over on the side of the wave pool!
Leafa
1840065_20_a
What's that lady shouting about?
Kirito
1840065_19_a
What's going on?
Leafa
1840065_18_a
Huh...?
Kirito
1840065_17_a
Hey! Stop right there, missy!
I said don't go in there!
???
1840065_16_a
Fine, fine. I'll stop bugging you.
Kirito
1840065_15_a
I'll do it! Eventually! Probably!
When I feel like it. Not now.
Leafa
1840065_14_a
I guess that's true...but come on!
Why are you so against swimming?!
Kirito
1840065_13_a
If you're serious about it, yeah.
But I'm just playing around in a
practice pool, so who cares?
Leafa
1840065_12_a
So wouldn't it be a good idea to
practice swimming after all?
Kirito
1840065_11_a
But if you surf in the ocean, you
still have to swim before and
after you get on the board.
Kirito
1840065_10_a
Hehe, thanks.
Leafa
1840065_9_a
Yeah, I used it too. But I'm
really impressed you managed to
ride the waves in the first place.
Kirito
1840065_8_a
There's that warning that flashes,
telling you what wave is coming
next, right?
Leafa
1840065_7_a
Oh yeah, I also have to admit that
OS helped a lot. I'm happy this
pool is supported.
Leafa
1840065_6_a
Why are you asking me?
Kirito
1840065_5_a
I guess so. Maybe it's because
I'm not in the water?
Leafa
1840065_4_a
So you suck at swimming,
but rock at surfing?
Kirito
1840065_3_a
Kirito
1840065_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
Hmm... I think I like this!
Surfing's awesome!
Leafa
1840065_1_a
You say that, but I barely lasted
a second out there...
Kirito
1840063_19_a
These waves are artificial, so
they're really easy to read. Once
you know the pattern, it's simple.
Leafa
1840063_18_a
Well, I doubt I'd do so well in
the actual ocean. Real waves are
probably pretty unpredictable.
Leafa
1840063_17_a
I bow to your ultimate athletic
skills, Sugu... I am not worthy...
Kirito
1840063_16_a
It's a piece of cake!
Leafa
1840063_15_a
Yeah! It's all balance, so as long
as you can keep your back
straight...
Leafa
1840063_14_a
I'm in awe...
Is this really your first time?
Kirito
1840063_13_a
Am I riding the waves?
Leafa
1840063_12_a
Focus, fooocuuus...
H-How am I doing?
Leafa
1840063_11_a
Wow...
Kirito
1840063_10_a
Whoa...
Ahhh...!
Leafa
1840063_9_a
Sugu, be careful...
Those waves are evil.
Kirito
1840063_8_a
Well, it's my turn next!
Leafa
1840063_7_a
This is...really hard... I heard
these waves were for practice,
but they're seriously hardcore...
Kirito
1840063_6_a
pant
pant
...
Kirito
1840063_5_a
Ahahaha! Nice epic fail, Kazuto!
Leafa
1840063_4_a
AAAAAAH! 
splash
Kirito
1840063_3_a
Leafa
1840063_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
Wh-Wh-Wh-WHOA!
Kirito
1840063_1_a
Yeah, let's go.
Kirito
1840061_21_a
That's reassuring!
Alright, let's give it a shot!
Leafa
1840061_20_a
So even if you fall in, you won't
have to worry about drowning.
Kirito
1840061_19_a
The waves are high, but the
water's usually pretty shallow.
Kirito
1840061_18_a
Hmm... Nice try. It sounds like
tons of fun, but if I fall in, I'll
have to swim. That's lame.
Leafa
1840061_17_a
Yeah. I hear they made it for
people who want to practice. I also
heard it's Augma compatible.
Kirito
1840061_16_a
Surfing?!
You can surf here?!
Leafa
1840061_15_a
I hear there's a wave
pool for surfing.
Kirito
1840061_14_a
Alright, how about this?
Let's head over thataway.
Kirito
1840061_13_a
Ha ha... Yeah, I'm being pretty
silly, huh?
Leafa
1840061_12_a
So you want to exercise, but you
don't want to swim? Oh, yeah.
That makes tons of sense.
Kirito
1840061_11_a
No, I guess not... I want to get
some exercise while I'm here.
Leafa
1840061_10_a
Well, I won't force you, but are
you sure you want to just paddle
around in the shallow end all day?
Kirito
1840061_9_a
Hmph! I'll have you know I can
get by just fine without stupid
water and stupid swimming!
Leafa
1840061_8_a
Oh, stop moaning and get in. You
won't get better unless you try.
Kirito
1840061_7_a
But I don't waaannnaaa...
Leafa
1840061_6_a
Isn't it about time to, you know,
swim?
Kirito
1840061_5_a
Yeah...?
Leafa
1840061_4_a
Hey, Sugu?
Kirito
1840061_3_a
Kirito
1840061_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
...
Leafa
1840061_1_a
Yup... Hehehe.
Liz
1840058_31_a
Premiere
1840058_30_a
Liz
1840058_29_a
Hehe. Those learning algorithms
are-er, I mean she's really
motivated to learn new things.
Strea
1840058_28_a
Klein
1840058_27_a
I'd be happy to.
Agil
1840058_26_a
Strea
1840058_25_a
Liz
1840058_24_a
That is fascinating, Agil. Could
you educate me more in the ways
of dance?
Premiere
1840058_23_a
Agil
1840058_22_a
Agil. Who the heck knows this
much about Bon dancing?
Klein
1840058_21_a
Premiere
1840058_20_a
Strea
1840058_19_a
Wow, nerd...
Liz
1840058_18_a
And Premiere, you nailed it.
You gave me the feels.
Agil
1840058_17_a
But the dance today was nice and
slow, kind of like the Owara
style.
Agil
1840058_16_a
Styles like the Awa Odori, Soran
Bushi, or Tanko Bushi are really
energetic and fun.
Agil
1840058_15_a
There are a lot of regional
variations, too.
Agil
1840058_14_a
Yeah. Some parts were really
flowy and stuff.
Klein
1840058_13_a
Klein
1840058_12_a
Now that you mention it, today's
Bon dance was similar to the
Kagura.
Agil
1840058_11_a
Yes. Also, the Kagura was a most
efficient way for me to gain
dancing experience.
Premiere
1840058_10_a
That's why you were able to put
your heart and soul into it.
Liz
1840058_9_a
I think it's because you know
what the Bon dance means now.
Liz
1840058_8_a
Liz
1840058_7_a
Strea
1840058_6_a
Thank you. Liz said the same.
Premiere
1840058_5_a
Yeah. You really improved.
Agil
1840058_4_a
Your Bon dancing was legit,
Premiere.
Klein
1840058_3_a
Agil
1840058_2_a
bg_event_festival
Hey guys. I noticed this from the
scaffold, and had to comment...
Klein
1840058_1_a
That is good to hear.
Premiere
1840057_20_a
Acceptable? It was great!
You did even better than the
first time.
Liz
1840057_19_a
Was my dancing acceptable?
Premiere
1840057_18_a
Liz. Strea.
Premiere
1840057_17_a
Hey, the Bon dance is wrapping up.
Strea
1840057_16_a
Hehe, exactly.
Liz
1840057_15_a
Oh! That makes sense! She
might be from a different world,
but she's still a goddess.
Strea
1840057_14_a
I told her that it was because
of who she is in Ainground,
and it seemed like it clicked.
Liz
1840057_13_a
She was just confused because
she didn't know WHY she enjoyed
them so much.
Liz
1840057_12_a
Things like shrines and the Bon
dance let her connect to the great
divine, or something like that.
Liz
1840057_11_a
We thought she was acting weird,
but it turns out that she just
likes holy stuff.
Liz
1840057_10_a
Well, it's not like she was upset
or anything.
Liz
1840057_9_a
Speaking of. Were you able to
help her at all?
Strea
1840057_8_a
And Premiere looks like she's
having fun dancing, too.
Liz
1840057_7_a
Yeah. The really are suited for
this!
Strea
1840057_6_a
Strea
1840057_5_a
Hehe, look at those boys beat
those drums! They're really
into it!
Liz
1840057_4_a
Yah!
Agil
1840057_3_a
Agil
1840057_2_a
bg_event_festival
Here we go!
Klein
1840057_1_a
Any time, Premiere.
Liz
1840055_21_a
You may be correct... This thought
comforts me, somehow. Thank you,
Liz.
Premiere
1840055_20_a
What you've been feeling in
this place is faith. A respect
for the divine, if you will.
Liz
1840055_19_a
Ahh, I think I get it.
You're the goddess of Ainground:
another dimension.
Liz
1840055_18_a
I am connected to something
greater than myself.
It makes me feel...serene.
Premiere
1840055_17_a
The Bon dance makes me feel
the same way I do when I stand
here.
Premiere
1840055_16_a
I see... I think I finally
understand.
Premiere
1840055_15_a
The idea is that with enough
veneration, the gods will bless us
with a bountiful harvest.
Liz
1840055_14_a
It's a summer festival, but get
this: it's kind of like an early
harvest festival.
Liz
1840055_13_a
Yup! It's a pretty ancient
tradition. People dance and offer
tributes to the gods.
Liz
1840055_12_a
It is?
Premiere
1840055_11_a
Yes. Actually, the Bon dance is
an embodiment of faith in itself.
Liz
1840055_10_a
So there are gods enshrined here?
Premiere
1840055_9_a
Well, you're a goddess too, right?
Some of that holy in the air
must be seeping into you.
Liz
1840055_8_a
This is a place where people pay
their respects to deities.
Liz
1840055_7_a
I feel as if I am being protected
by a great and sublime force.
Premiere
1840055_6_a
Perhaps... It is very tranquil.
Premiere
1840055_5_a
Taken a liking to this shrine?
Liz
1840055_4_a
Liz
1840055_3_a
Liz?
Premiere
1840055_2_a
bg_event_festival
Premiere
Liz
1840055_1_a
Thanks, Liz!
Strea
1840053_21_a
Anyway, I'll try to talk to her
about it. You just leave it to me!
Liz
1840053_20_a
Yeah... There ARE a lot of
subtleties that are hard to wrap
my head around.
Strea
1840053_19_a
So you're stuck trying to figure
it out like the rest of us.
Liz
1840053_18_a
The problem is that people-NPCs or
humans-don't know what they're
feeling half the time.
Liz
1840053_17_a
Well, NPCs or not, both of you
experience the same sort of
emotions us humans do.
Liz
1840053_16_a
...
Liz
1840053_15_a
Maybe. Last I saw her, she was
alone with her eyes closed,
just taking it all in.
Strea
1840053_14_a
Huh... I guess she really likes
it there?
Liz
1840053_13_a
Nope. It's just a regular old
shrine right now.
Strea
1840053_12_a
Is there another special event
over there or something?
Liz
1840053_11_a
Ah, over where they held the
Kagura. Got it.
Liz
1840053_10_a
She said she'd be wandering round
the shrine until the next event
starts.
Strea
1840053_9_a
Where is Premiere, anyway?
Liz
1840053_8_a
To be honest, it sounds
complicated. You're not the only
one in the dark, Strea...
Liz
1840053_7_a
So how is it that I can't
even understand what another NPC
is going through?
Strea
1840053_6_a
I was designed to help people work
through their troubles. I'm
supposed to be really good at it!
Strea
1840053_5_a
What? Why?
Liz
1840053_4_a
Yeah... I'm pretty disappointed
in myself.
Strea
1840053_3_a
Strea
1840053_2_a
bg_event_festival
So that's what's been bugging
Premiere, huh?
Liz
1840053_1_a
Hmm...
Strea
1840051_16_a
However... I find it difficult
to adequately articulate my
feelings on this matter.
Premiere
1840051_15_a
I am not sure if I made myself
clear. I also enjoy the simple
pleasures of the dance.
Premiere
1840051_14_a
It sounds like you're reading way
more into it than your casual
festival-goer...
Strea
1840051_13_a
Umm... Cool?
Strea
1840051_12_a
Rather, the slow, rhythmic
movements and the spirit of the
event help me feel at peace.
Premiere
1840051_11_a
It is not the dancing that holds
any particular interest to me.
Premiere
1840051_10_a
Of course! I guess you've really
taken a liking to dancing, huh?
Strea
1840051_9_a
Would it be appropriate for me
to go to another?
Premiere
1840051_8_a
I have already attended one dance
with Liz today.
Premiere
1840051_7_a
Oh yeah. The second Bon dance is
starting soon. Do you want to go?
Strea
1840051_6_a
Aww, I'm glad to hear that.
Strea
1840051_5_a
I should be thanking you, Strea.
I learned a great deal today.
Premiere
1840051_4_a
Premiere
1840051_3_a
Thanks so much for all your help
today!
Strea
1840051_2_a
bg_event_festival
Hey, Premiere!
Strea
1840051_1_a
Okay!
Strea
1840038_26_a
We'll all help you get strong,
Strea! Okay?
Asuna
1840038_25_a
Hehe, don't worry. OS is really
fun, even without superhero
powers.
Asuna
1840038_24_a
Asuna
1840038_23_a
Fiiine. I'll give them up.
sigh
...
Strea
1840038_22_a
Yui
1840038_21_a
It's better if you play without
them.
Kirito
1840038_20_a
Yui
1840038_19_a
Ha ha. Sure, I get that, but
it might be bad for the game,
balance-wise.
Kirito
1840038_18_a
Asuna
1840038_17_a
Come on. If you were me, you'd
want to try out these bad boys
too.
Strea
1840038_16_a
Kirito
1840038_15_a
That's not fair, Strea!
Yui
1840038_14_a
Mm-hmm. Yui didn't get any
bonuses like that, because she
was a kid turning into a kid.
Kirito
1840038_13_a
OS adapted the functionality
of her wings into an in-game
item with comparable stats.
Yui
1840038_12_a
Kirito
1840038_11_a
I see... Since Strea's a gnome,
Yui
1840038_10_a
Strea
1840038_9_a
Uhh... "Your body becomes light
as a fairy, allowing you to freely
move through the air."
Asuna
1840038_8_a
Yui
1840038_7_a
I knew it... What are its effects?
Kirito
1840038_6_a
Asuna
1840038_5_a
...
Strea
1840038_4_a
Strea has something called
"Gnome's Wings" equipped!
Asuna
1840038_3_a
Strea
1840038_2_a
bg_os_cafe
Aha! Is THIS it?!
Asuna
1840038_1_a
Strea
1840037_32_a
Well...
Kirito
1840037_31_a
Yui
1840037_30_a
So, what is it you think you'll
find?
Asuna
1840037_29_a
I can narrow it down if you
could tell me what you're
looking for.
Asuna
1840037_28_a
Yui
1840037_27_a
Kirito. I'll check her inventory
for you.
Asuna
1840037_26_a
Strea
1840037_25_a
F-Fine...
Kirito
1840037_24_a
Yui
1840037_23_a
Ahem. Calm down, kids.
Asuna
1840037_22_a
Strea
1840037_21_a
G-Give me a break here!
Kirito
1840037_20_a
Aaaah! Someone stop Kirito! He's
trying to force himself upon me!
Oh dear! Whatever shall I do?
Strea
1840037_19_a
Come on, give it up! NOW!
Kirito
1840037_18_a
gulp
Strea
1840037_17_a
Aha! I bet you know exactly what
I'm looking for!
Kirito
1840037_16_a
I-I'm not smirking!
Strea
1840037_15_a
And what are YOU smirking
about?
Kirito
1840037_14_a
Hee hee...
Strea
1840037_13_a
Strea
1840037_12_a
N-No! You've got it all wrong!
I just want to test a hypothesis...
Kirito
1840037_11_a
Really, Daddy?
Yui
1840037_9_a
Asuna
1840037_10_a
Yui
1840037_8_a
Kirito...
Asuna
1840037_7_a
Kirito
1840037_6_a
D-Don't, Kirito. M-My, you're quite
the horndog, trying to peek
a look at a girl's belongings.
Strea
1840037_5_a
There's something I want to check!
Kirito
1840037_4_a
Huh? Wh-Why?
Strea
1840037_3_a
Strea
1840037_2_a
bg_os_cafe
Strea! Let me have a look at your
inventory of equipment.
Kirito
1840037_1_a
Strea
1840035_30_a
What are you thinking, Kirito?
Asuna
1840035_29_a
Yui
1840035_28_a
Wait... Fly around?
Kirito
1840035_27_a
Being able to fly around in this
game is not normal...
Kirito
1840035_26_a
So why didn't Strea's avatar get
adjusted in the same way...?
Kirito
1840035_25_a
Yui
1840035_24_a
Yeah... Yui can only do things
that appear physically possible.
Kirito
1840035_23_a
Strea
1840035_22_a
Yui's avatar has movement
restrictions to match her
childlike appearance.
Asuna
1840035_21_a
Yui
1840035_20_a
If the devs find out about her
through news like this, they
might try to fix the issue, though.
Kirito
1840035_19_a
is allowed, but it isn't fully
supported. Something weird
must've happened with Strea.
Kirito
1840035_18_a
Yui
1840035_17_a
I have a feeling something didn't
go right. Yes, the conversion of
avatars from different games
Kirito
1840035_16_a
Asuna
1840035_15_a
So what's the big problem?
I'm not doing anything wrong.
Strea
1840035_14_a
I was converted without any
problems, which means the
system let me in.
Strea
1840035_13_a
Asuna
1840035_12_a
Jeez, why are you guys all
so negative?
Strea
1840035_11_a
I'd be more surprised if people
didn't notice something like that.
Yui
1840035_9_a
Kirito
1840035_10_a
She used flashy, superhuman moves
to take down a huge monster.
Yui
1840035_8_a
I guess someone saw her
and wrote about it...
Kirito
1840035_7_a
Yui
1840035_6_a
Sorry to break it to you, but
yeah... We had her join in a
battle the other day...
Kirito
1840035_5_a
Strea
1840035_4_a
Don't tell me this article's
about Strea...
Asuna
1840035_3_a
Strea
1840035_2_a
bg_os_cafe
Invincible Super Adapt
Spotted in OS!
Asuna
1840035_1_a
That's exactly what I'm saying,
Strea...
Kirito
1840033_26_a
It almost sounds like you're
saying I shouldn't be the real
me in this game!
Strea
1840033_25_a
Aww, guys!
Strea
1840033_24_a
I don't think so. Auto-adjusting
converted avatars is a built-in
feature of this game.
Kirito
1840033_23_a
D-Do you think I made some sort
of mistake?
Yui
1840033_22_a
When I converted Yui's avatar,
OS restricted her automatically...
Kirito
1840033_21_a
That's the problem... I'm
actually surprised you don't
have any movement restrictions.
Kirito
1840033_20_a
What? But I didn't do anything
differently from when I'm in ALO!
Strea
1840033_19_a
Y-Yeah! The other players will
get suspicious if you go around
breaking the rules of physics!
Yui
1840033_18_a
Come on, Strea.
You can't do that!
Kirito
1840033_17_a
Yui
1840033_16_a
Kirito
1840033_15_a
bg_os_town_2
Wow, OS is so much fun!
Strea
1840033_14_a
Strea
1840033_13_a
to climb onto a monster of that
size. I must be seeing things...
Player B
1840033_12_a
R-Right... Not to mention, you'd
have to be able to jump at least
ten feet high
Player B
1840033_11_a
but there's no way you could
physically climb on top of
graphical data.
Player A
1840033_10_a
Ha ha, I'm sure you were just
seeing things. You can feel the
impact of slashing things in OS,
Player A
1840033_9_a
Wasn't she climbing on top of
a monster just now?
Player B
1840033_8_a
Yeah...but...
Player B
1840033_7_a
Strea
1840033_6_a
bg_os_town_1
That chick is tearin' it up...
Player A
1840033_5_a
bg_black
Gyaaargghh!!
Monster
1840033_4_a
bg_os_town_1
Take THAT!
Strea
1840033_3_a
bg_black
Grawwwh!
Monster
1840033_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Yah!
Strea
1840033_1_a
Hehe, you'll be playing OS
in no time!
Yui
1840031_20_a
Wow! That's so cool, Yui!
Strea
1840031_19_a
Sure, no problem.
Kirito
1840031_18_a
I'd like to try converting Strea
myself, if you could supervise
me.
Yui
1840031_17_a
since I watched you convert
me for OS.
Yui
1840031_16_a
Wait, Daddy. I have a pretty
good grasp of conversion,
Yui
1840031_15_a
Okay, gotcha. Let's try it
out, then.
Kirito
1840031_14_a
Of course I do! I've been with you
guys all through SAO and ALO!
I don't want to be left out now!
Strea
1840031_13_a
Do you want to play OS too,
Strea?
Kirito
1840031_12_a
Oh, right...
Kirito
1840031_11_a
I only get to spend time with
you guys in here!
Strea
1840031_10_a
Yui gets to hang out with Kirito
and everyone in that AR game,
Ordinal Scale!
Strea
1840031_9_a
What's not fair?
Yui
1840031_8_a
Wh-What's wrong, Strea?
Kirito
1840031_7_a
Why does Yui always get to
have all the fun?!
Strea
1840031_6_a
IT'S! NOT! FAIR!
Strea
1840031_5_a
Huh?
Kirito
1840031_4_a
Yui
1840031_3_a
Kirito
1840031_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
No fair!
Strea
1840031_1_a
Of course.
Kirito
1840028_19_a
You're both coming with me,
right?
Sinon
1840028_18_a
I am. Now, I'd love to test
out my new treasure.
Sinon
1840028_17_a
Hehe. You seem a lot happier
now.
Yui
1840028_16_a
Even if it was just a story
that ALO made up.
Sinon
1840028_15_a
Yeah. At least, it was enough
to change MY opinion...
Sinon
1840028_14_a
These retellings of old tales
really make you look at them
in a different light.
Kirito
1840028_13_a
Interesting. I guess it's
like you said, Sinon.
Kirito
1840028_12_a
Yeah. The point wasn't to kill
it, but to use certain keywords
to reason with it.
Sinon
1840028_11_a
There was another way, after all.
Just like you said.
Kirito
1840028_10_a
Whoa, that's awesome!
Kirito
1840028_9_a
item_event_leo_hastam
See? It even gave me an item out
of appreciation. It's called the
Treasure of Leo.
Sinon
1840028_8_a
I think I was able to convince
it to leave, for its own safety.
Sinon
1840028_7_a
What did it say to you?
Yui
1840028_6_a
Yeah...
Sinon
1840028_5_a
The lion's going somewhere
with its cub!
Kirito
1840028_4_a
Yui
1840028_3_a
Sinon
1840028_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Oh! Hey, Sinon!
Kirito
1840028_1_a
...
Lion
1840027_28_a
However, they are worthy
of consideration...
Lion
1840027_27_a
Hm...? It is difficult to make
sense of your words.
Lion
1840027_26_a
In fact, I'm ashamed of myself
for judging you based on shallow
assumptions.
Sinon
1840027_25_a
Even though you're supposed to be
my enemy, you're simply living
your own life...
Sinon
1840027_24_a
I realized that you were only
trying to protect the thing that's
most precious to you.
Sinon
1840027_23_a
But...why would you help me?
Lion
1840027_22_a
Indeed. I am not immune to
everything, powerful as I may
be.
Lion
1840027_21_a
...
Lion
1840027_20_a
Strangle...me...?
Lion
1840027_19_a
But there are other ways. They
could strangle you, for instance.
Sinon
1840027_18_a
You're right. It could be difficult
to wound your strong body.
Sinon
1840027_17_a
Not even human steel could
pierce this flesh!
Lion
1840027_16_a
Our lives are in danger?
Ludicrous!
Lion
1840027_15_a
Your lives are in danger if you
stay here.
Sinon
1840027_14_a
Athena and the other gods are
plotting to defeat you right now.
Sinon
1840027_13_a
Why should I stop?
Lion
1840027_12_a
I hunt to survive and provide
for my offspring.
Lion
1840027_11_a
Stop eating people?
Imbecile... I am a beast!
Lion
1840027_10_a
Hey. Could you stop eating
people?
Sinon
1840027_9_a
I guess only Cait Siths who have
used this magic can talk to it.
Sinon
1840027_8_a
Y-Yeah...
I'm a little scared...
Yui
1840027_7_a
I can't hear anything, but I can
see that it's glaring at me...
Kirito
1840027_6_a
It worked!
Sinon
1840027_5_a
Yui
1840027_4_a
Kirito
1840027_3_a
Sinon
1840027_2_a
bg_18_mountain
It seems you fools are eager to
become my dinner.
Lion
1840027_1_a
Yup!
Sinon
1840025_34_a
You gonna try it out?
Kirito
1840025_33_a
Ah, here it is!
Sinon
1840025_32_a
I think it's reserved for special
events like these.
Sinon
1840025_31_a
Not all animals, of course...
Sinon
1840025_30_a
Well, there's this Cait Sith
magic that lets you talk to
animals.
Sinon
1840025_29_a
Sinon... What are you doing
staring at your HoloWindow?
Yui
1840025_28_a
I might have just the thing to
help!
Sinon
1840025_27_a
Yup... There has to be another
way. Which reminds me!
Sinon
1840025_26_a
You're being a little cryptic.
Are you saying defeating the
lion isn't the answer?
Kirito
1840025_25_a
This is all starting to make
sense...
Sinon
1840025_24_a
Sinon...?
Yui
1840025_23_a
Maybe the reason it's been
attacking people is only to
protect its young...
Sinon
1840025_22_a
Wait...! Leo keeps Leo Minor
close to it in the night sky too.
Sinon
1840025_21_a
Hey, you two! The big lion's
coming this way! Hide!
Kirito
1840025_20_a
Yui
1840025_19_a
Sinon
1840025_18_a
Kirito
1840025_17_a
Grrrooowl...
???
1840025_16_a
A cub? Hmm... Leo Minor?
Sinon
1840025_15_a
Hey, wait... Its fur looks a lot
like the lion's... Do you think
it's a cub?
Kirito
1840025_14_a
Kirito
1840025_13_a
How cute!
It looks like a cuddly kitty cat!
Yui
1840025_12_a
Look there, under that tree!
Sinon
1840025_11_a
What's up, Sinon?
Kirito
1840025_10_a
Hmm.
Sinon
1840025_9_a
...
Sinon
1840025_8_a
Not to mention it would probably
swallow you in one bite the
second you got close enough.
Kirito
1840025_7_a
No, that's impossible. Size-wise,
a fairy avatar's arms aren't long
enough to go around its neck.
Yui
1840025_6_a
So, what? I'm supposed to
strangle that thing with my
bare hands?
Sinon
1840025_5_a
Hahaha... Your arrows might
as well have been feathers.
Kirito
1840025_4_a
Yui
1840025_3_a
Kirito
1840025_2_a
bg_18_mountain
sigh
That was nuts...
Sinon
1840025_1_a
Yeah, of course!
Sinon
1840023_28_a
Kirito
1840023_27_a
Sinon
1840023_26_a
Sinon, are you really going to try
to shoot it with your arrows?
Yui
1840023_25_a
When someone tells me I can't
do something, I want to prove
them wrong!
Sinon
1840023_24_a
Still...
Sinon
1840023_23_a
Yeah... My arrows aren't going
to do a thing to him.
Sinon
1840023_22_a
Yep, I see it.
Wow... That is one huge lion.
Kirito
1840023_21_a
Yui
1840023_20_a
Kirito
1840023_19_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
Psst, look over there...
Sinon
1840023_18_a
Then that settles it.
Follow me.
Sinon
1840023_17_a
Sure, that's no problem.
Kirito
1840023_16_a
You can still give me pointers,
though, right?
Sinon
1840023_15_a
Huh... Eh, alright, whatever.
Sinon
1840023_14_a
So if your quest is anything
similar, you might have to go
it alone.
Kirito
1840023_13_a
Well, Asuna had to do her Libra
quest solo too.
Kirito
1840023_12_a
Where'd you get that idea?
Sinon
1840023_11_a
This is your personal quest,
Sinon. I'm not sure if we can
just join in.
Kirito
1840023_10_a
What do you mean?
Sinon
1840023_9_a
Sure, I don't mind.
If we're allowed to, that is.
Kirito
1840023_8_a
You'll help me, right?
Sinon
1840023_7_a
Exactly. It's a good thing I ran
into you guys, 'cause I'm totally
out of ideas.
Sinon
1840023_6_a
Hmm. If it's anything like the
legend, your arrows might not
even scratch it.
Kirito
1840023_5_a
I have to defeat the man-eating
lion living in the fields nearby.
Sinon
1840023_4_a
Yui
1840023_3_a
Sinon
1840023_2_a
bg_event_seashore
What's the quest about, anyway?
Kirito
1840023_1_a
Ha ha...
I know what you mean.
Kirito
1840021_22_a
Ineffective arrows, dead lion...
It's hard not to take the story
a little personally.
Sinon
1840021_21_a
Anyway, Hercules had to strangle
the lion to death since it was
impervious to arrows.
Sinon
1840021_20_a
I guess, but we wouldn't have
heroes if it weren't for their
enemies!
Kirito
1840021_19_a
It's just sad that my astrological
sign exists only to be defeated...
Sinon
1840021_18_a
I think I do remember
something about that...
Kirito
1840021_17_a
Are you familiar with the story?
Leo was based on the man-eating
lion that Hercules killed.
Sinon
1840021_16_a
I came here for the new, Leo
-specific quest.
Sinon
1840021_15_a
About what?
Yui
1840021_14_a
Well...
I was just a bit disappointed.
Sinon
1840021_13_a
Plus, you can't hide your facial
expressions in VR. You can tell us
if there's something bothering you.
Kirito
1840021_12_a
Sinon, Yui is an MHCP. She's a
pro when it comes to sensing
peoples' emotions.
Kirito
1840021_11_a
Huh? O-Oh... Sorry.
It's nothing...
Sinon
1840021_10_a
Sinon, you seem a bit down.
Yui
1840021_9_a
I see...
Sinon
1840021_8_a
You just missed her. She had
some stuff to take care of, so
she logged out.
Kirito
1840021_7_a
So you're here too, huh?
Where's Asuna?
Sinon
1840021_6_a
Yui
1840021_5_a
Sinon
1840021_4_a
Hey! I didn't know you were
here on Thule.
Kirito
1840021_3_a
Kirito
1840021_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Oh, Daddy!
It's Sinon.
Yui
1840021_1_a
Hehe, it's nothing.
Just a little thought.
Asuna
1840018_34_a
What do you mean, Mommy?
Yui
1840018_33_a
Huh...?
Kirito
1840018_32_a
...I'll be able to protect the
both of you.
Asuna
1840018_31_a
Aww, don't worry. Once I get
the hang of using this item...
Asuna
1840018_30_a
Gah, I'm jealous! Isn't there
a quest for Libra guys?
Kirito
1840018_29_a
item_event_libra_spear
Hehe, yeah. It's a treasure
just for us Libras.
Asuna
1840018_28_a
Did you get anything for it?
Kirito
1840018_27_a
Kirito
1840018_26_a
Yui
1840018_25_a
Yeah. I guess so, Athena.
Asuna
1840018_24_a
It seems you've passed
Astraea's test without issue.
Athena
1840018_23_a
I'm fine... Just a little winded
from being sent back here so
suddenly.
Asuna
1840018_22_a
Are you hurt, Mommy?
Yui
1840018_21_a
Oh, Kirito... Yeah...
Asuna
1840018_20_a
Asuna! You okay?
Kirito
1840018_19_a
Kirito
1840018_18_a
Yui
1840018_17_a
bg_23_alne_terrace_sunset
Huh...?
Asuna
1840018_16_a
Whoa!
Asuna
1840018_15_a
I give you this treasure, as a
sign of my approval...
Astraea
1840018_14_a
Huh...?
Asuna
1840018_13_a
What a fine answer.
You are truly worthy of my gift.
Astraea
1840018_12_a
...
Astraea
1840018_11_a
I won't give up. I will
keep searching for
ways to save both!
Asuna
1840018_10_a
I will ask them to help me
protect the ones I love.
Asuna
1840018_9_a
Your friends...?
Astraea
1840018_8_a
I will head to my friends!
Asuna
1840018_7_a
I refuse to choose one
over the other, even if
it's a cop-out. Instead...
Asuna
1840018_6_a
My partner and my child are
equally important.
Asuna
1840018_5_a
Yes...
Asuna
1840018_4_a
You won't take either path?
Is that your answer?
Astraea
1840018_3_a
Hm...?
Astraea
1840018_2_a
bg_04_field_flower_fog
...I wouldn't take either path.
Asuna
1840018_1_a
...
Asuna
1840017_25_a
Now, tell me. Which path will
you take? Show me the justice
within.
Astraea
1840017_24_a
It's...an unanswerable question...
Asuna
1840017_23_a
N-No...
I couldn't possibly choose...
Asuna
1840017_22_a
Which path will you take? Your
answer will show me where your
heart lies.
Astraea
1840017_21_a
...
Asuna
1840017_20_a
Enemy forces are closing in on
both of their villages at once.
Astraea
1840017_19_a
...
Asuna
1840017_18_a
Down one path lives your lover,
and down the other lives your
child.
Astraea
1840017_17_a
Good... Here is the question.
Imagine the road forks past
this flower garden.
Astraea
1840017_16_a
Y-Yes, of course!
Asuna
1840017_15_a
Uh...
I should probably say "Yes" here.
Asuna
1840017_14_a
You've come this far. Am I correct
in assuming you have the courage
to look within?
Astraea
1840017_13_a
Those scales will be the judge...
Astraea
1840017_12_a
Justice, huh...
Asuna
1840017_11_a
Now, show me the justice
in your heart.
Astraea
1840017_10_a
Yes. I am Astraea, the
celestial virgin.
???
1840017_9_a
Astraea?
Asuna
1840017_8_a
So... You must be...
Asuna
1840017_7_a
It is not Athena to whom you speak.
I am only borrowing her visage, as
I am not present in your realm.
???
1840017_6_a
Huh? Athena?
Asuna
1840017_5_a
I see you have strong ties to
me... It must be why the stars
brought you here.
???
1840017_4_a
What is this place?
Asuna
1840017_3_a
...!
Asuna
1840017_2_a
bg_04_field_flower_fog
...
Asuna
1840017_1_a
Waaaaah!
Asuna
1840015_31_a
I just have to touch these
scales, right?
Asuna
1840015_30_a
Sure, why not?
Asuna
1840015_29_a
Why don't you try it, Asuna?
I'm sure something will happen.
Kirito
1840015_28_a
I read that Astraea used those
scales to judge the hearts of
mankind.
Yui
1840015_27_a
...Well, that sucks.
Kirito
1840015_26_a
That certainly clarifies things.
This quest can only be accepted
by Libra women.
Yui
1840015_25_a
Only women can talk to
Astraea...?
Asuna
1840015_24_a
Why don't you try it?
Athena
1840015_23_a
It is said that any woman she
approves of can communicate
with her by touching them.
Athena
1840015_22_a
Astraea is the goddess of
justice. Her scales reflect
her heart like a mirror.
Athena
1840015_21_a
You seem to be curious about
the scales, dear fairies.
Athena
1840015_20_a
Yui
1840015_19_a
Kirito
1840015_18_a
So our signs DO have to do with
it. But why only me...?
Asuna
1840015_17_a
I heard Astraea's scales are
what became known as the
constellation Libra.
Yui
1840015_16_a
Oh! You're right!
Kirito
1840015_15_a
It looks like the statue is
holding a pair of scales!
Asuna
1840015_14_a
What? Is there something on
the statue?
Kirito
1840015_13_a
Mm-hmm. Hey, what is that?
Asuna
1840015_12_a
Yup. You're a Libra like me,
Asuna. There are no Virgos here.
Kirito
1840015_11_a
Ah...
I see where you're going.
Asuna
1840015_10_a
and only Virgo players can
accept it...
Kirito
1840015_9_a
Well, if this statue's related
to the new quest,
Kirito
1840015_8_a
What do you mean, Kirito?
Asuna
1840015_7_a
but I change my mind.
Kirito
1840015_6_a
Hmm... For a moment, I thought
maybe the player's sign had to do
with the quest,
Kirito
1840015_5_a
I believe the story of the
constellation Virgo was
based on her.
Yui
1840015_4_a
Asuna
1840015_3_a
Kirito
1840015_2_a
bg_23_alne_terrace
She's a goddess from
mythology too.
Yui
1840015_1_a
Astraea, huh...
Asuna
1840013_32_a
That statue is in the image of
Astraea, the celestial virgin.
Athena
1840013_31_a
Ah, she is one of our own.
Athena
1840013_30_a
They look a little different
from ours...
Kirito
1840013_29_a
She has wings.
Could she be a fairy?
Yui
1840013_28_a
That statue of the woman?
Hmm, I don't remember...
Kirito
1840013_27_a
Hey, Kirito, Yui. Was that
stone statue there the last
time we were here?
Asuna
1840013_26_a
Nope...
Kirito
1840013_25_a
It doesn't seem like any event
is starting...
Yui
1840013_24_a
Thanks. We appreciate it.
Kirito
1840013_23_a
Please stay and make
yourselves comfortable
for as long as you'd like.
Athena
1840013_22_a
First, I must apologize for the
way I treated you fairies.
I was ignorant.
Athena
1840013_21_a
Hi there. We just thought
we'd stop by for a bit.
Kirito
1840013_20_a
Asuna
1840013_19_a
Kirito
1840013_18_a
Yui
1840013_17_a
bg_23_alne_terrace
I remember you...!
Athena
1840013_16_a
Cool, let's go.
Asuna
1840013_15_a
We should go pay her another
visit.
Kirito
1840013_14_a
Well, Athena has to be involved
in some way, right?
Kirito
1840013_13_a
Where should we start? This
place is pretty big.
Asuna
1840013_12_a
We can still explore the island
together and find that quest.
Asuna
1840013_11_a
Ha ha... It's too early to give
up, Kirito.
Asuna
1840013_10_a
Did I come here for nothing,
then?
Kirito
1840013_9_a
Gah... You might have a point...
Kirito
1840013_8_a
Isn't there a possibility
that you can't accept the
quest?
Yui
1840013_7_a
If Mommy got a notification,
but you didn't...
Yui
1840013_6_a
What is it, Yui?
Kirito
1840013_5_a
Listen, Daddy...
Yui
1840013_4_a
Yui
1840013_3_a
Asuna
1840013_2_a
bg_event_seashore
I'm tagging along, regardless.
Let's see what this new quest's
about.
Kirito
1840013_1_a
...
Kirito
1840011_21_a
Hmm, beats me. What have
I done recently that Kirito
hasn't?
Asuna
1840011_20_a
Maybe it was only sent to
players who met certain
conditions.
Yui
1840011_19_a
You didn't?
Asuna
1840011_18_a
Huh? Weird... I didn't get
anything.
Kirito
1840011_17_a
I just got the announcement
message.
Asuna
1840011_16_a
Yui
1840011_15_a
Kirito
1840011_14_a
Hey, Kirito! Did you hear about
the new quest on Thule?
Asuna
1840011_13_a
Okay!
Yui
1840011_12_a
You're right. Let's grab Asuna
and see if there's anything
new there.
Kirito
1840011_11_a
Isn't there a chance something's
been implemented without
warning?
Yui
1840011_10_a
Yeah...
No announcements yet.
Kirito
1840011_9_a
I see. Is that what you've been
looking into?
Yui
1840011_8_a
but I have a feeling some new
quests are on the horizon.
Kirito
1840011_7_a
I know the main quest's over,
Kirito
1840011_6_a
Uh-huh.
Yui
1840011_5_a
You remember when we fought
Athena on Thule, right?
Kirito
1840011_4_a
What is it, Daddy?
Yui
1840011_3_a
Yui
1840011_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Any day now...
Kirito
1840011_1_a
Heh, yeah. This beats
tightrope walking any day!
Kirito
1650078_26_a
Kirito
1650078_25_a
But Sinon seems happy with how it
all worked out in the end.
Leafa
1650078_24_a
Sinon
1650078_23_a
Ook ook!
Monkey
1650078_22_a
Now! Prepare to be amazed by
our super-simian feats of balance!
Sinon
1650078_21_a
Leafa
1650078_20_a
Yeah.
Kirito
1650078_19_a
They try a bunch of stuff, get
confused, and miss the point...
Leafa
1650078_18_a
Heh heh! I guess nobody else
figured out there was a story
flag.
Leafa
1650078_17_a
Wow! That's actually a pretty easy
fix once you've worked out the
problem!
Kirito
1650078_16_a
The answer is HATS! As long as
our ears are covered, they're okay
with us.
Leafa
1650078_15_a
Hm, I think I get what you're
saying... But how did you get
past a hurdle like that?
Kirito
1650078_14_a
Yeah! Think of it this way.
They're from the human world...
They don't even know what we are!
Leafa
1650078_13_a
Fairies? As in...all of us?
Kirito
1650078_12_a
But in the end, it turned out
they just weren't used to fairies!
Leafa
1650078_11_a
We tried everything! Playing
with them, hanging in there
even when they bit us...
Leafa
1650078_10_a
How'd you manage to pull it off?
Kirito
1650078_9_a
Hehe! What did I tell you? Sinon
really got through to them!
Leafa
1650078_8_a
Leafa
1650078_7_a
Whoa! I can't believe it...
She's got them following her
every command perfectly!
Kirito
1650078_6_a
Sinon
1650078_5_a
RAAAWWWR!
Lion
1650078_4_a
And now for the ring of fire!
Sinon
1650078_3_a
Brrrrooaw!!
Elephant
1650078_2_a
bg_event_circus
Now... Spin!
Sinon
1650078_1_a
I see... And if that's the case,
we'll be a lot closer to finding
a solution.
Sinon
1650077_23_a
Yeah! That's got to be it!
Leafa
1650077_22_a
Are you implying that this could
all have something to do with a
simple story flag?
Sinon
1650077_21_a
Let me try and talk to them!
If they freak out at me too,
then we'll know for sure!
Leafa
1650077_20_a
The animals might be scared,
but...I doubt it's personal,
Sinon.
Leafa
1650077_19_a
Oh! That's right... I even joked
that it must have been because
I'm a Cait Sith.
Sinon
1650077_18_a
Remember how fast you hit it off
with the horse you rode in that
real-world archery performance?
Leafa
1650077_17_a
Yikes! Lucky for us, this is
just VR. But hey, wait a sec...
Leafa
1650077_16_a
One of them tried to bite me and
I slapped them away on instinct...
Sinon
1650077_15_a
What about petting them?
Leafa
1650077_14_a
Yeah, but it didn't work.
Sinon
1650077_13_a
Have you tried giving them treats?
Leafa
1650077_12_a
As soon as I step near them, they
get frightened and start yowling.
Sinon
1650077_11_a
I was hoping to perform with the
trained animals, but...they all
hate me.
Sinon
1650077_10_a
So... What are you having
trouble with, anyway?
Leafa
1650077_9_a
Ha ha ha! Good one! We both know
you're in way too deep to back out
now!
Leafa
1650077_8_a
That's very kind of you, Leafa,
but it's not like I've officially
joined the troupe or anything.
Sinon
1650077_7_a
Heh, yeah. Well, as your fellow
circus artiste, I'll do whatever
I can to help you out!
Leafa
1650077_6_a
Oh... I suppose Kirito told you
about that. He really can't keep
his mouth shut, huh?
Sinon
1650077_5_a
You really wanted to do a
circus animal show, right?
Leafa
1650077_4_a
Uh, what are you talking about?
Sinon
1650077_3_a
Sinon
1650077_2_a
bg_event_circus
Hi, Sinon! I heard you could use
some help!
Leafa
1650077_1_a
Ha ha...
This...could take a while.
Kirito
1650075_19_a
OOK OOK OOK!!
Monkey
1650075_18_a
BRAAAOOOWW!
Elephant
1650075_17_a
GROOOAAAAAHHHH!
Lion
1650075_16_a
Easy there, easy...
S-See? I'm not so scary...!
Sinon
1650075_15_a
Thanks for the talk, Kirito.
Now, back to work...
Sinon
1650075_14_a
Gotcha. Well, it'll be tough to
pull off, but I'm rooting for you.
Kirito
1650075_13_a
Exactly.
Sinon
1650075_12_a
I guess that means you've got
to do this yourself, huh?
Kirito
1650075_11_a
There's no substitute for that,
no matter how long it takes.
Kirito
1650075_10_a
I guess you're right... These acts
need the tamer and the animals
to trust each other.
Kirito
1650075_9_a
But then I'd never be able
to forge a bond with them.
Sinon
1650075_8_a
Sure, it might be easy to bring
someone in as a go-between...
Sinon
1650075_7_a
And at the end of the day,
I'm the one trying to get
through to these animals.
Sinon
1650075_6_a
Is it fair to rely on Silica
every time we need a tamer?
I am a Cait Sith too, after all.
Sinon
1650075_5_a
Huh? Why?
Kirito
1650075_4_a
But I think I'll pass.
Sinon
1650075_3_a
Kirito
1650075_2_a
bg_event_circus
True... Asking Silica might be
a good idea...
Sinon
1650075_1_a
...
Sinon
1650073_20_a
It's a roundabout way, but it
should work.
Kirito
1650073_19_a
She can tame just about anything!
You could ask her to make them
to listen to you.
Kirito
1650073_18_a
Aha! I know! How about asking
Silica?
Kirito
1650073_17_a
Mm-hm...
Sinon
1650073_16_a
That must be pretty frustrating.
Kirito
1650073_15_a
So it's not a question of how
much effort you put into it, huh?
Kirito
1650073_14_a
Yup. That's the problem.
Sinon
1650073_13_a
Ah, I see what you mean. And
unless they warm up to you,
training will be impossible...
Kirito
1650073_12_a
These animals are from the human
world. There's no guarantee that
our skills would work on them.
Sinon
1650073_11_a
Why on earth would that help?
Cait Sith tame monsters. Monsters!
Sinon
1650073_10_a
But...you're a Cait Sith,
aren't you...?
Kirito
1650073_9_a
Unfortunately, animals really
don't seem to like me...
Sinon
1650073_8_a
They... They don't sound happy.
Kirito
1650073_7_a
...
Sinon
1650073_6_a
Oook! Oook! Oook!!
Monkey
1650073_5_a
Brraaaooow!
BRRAAAAOOW!
Elephant
1650073_4_a
Kirito
1650073_3_a
Sinon
1650073_2_a
bg_event_circus
Graaaawr!!!
Lion
1650073_1_a
Hup!
Kirito
1650071_16_a
Umm... Well...
Sinon
1650071_15_a
Right. So I guess the tightrope
act was just a part of your
training?
Kirito
1650071_14_a
That's why I thought it might be
more fun to perform with animals.
Sinon
1650071_13_a
I don't like to be the center
of attention if I can help it.
Sinon
1650071_12_a
Oh yeah... Come to think of it, no
one did that at the show today.
Kirito
1650071_11_a
Have you seen the ones where
trained animals do tricks?
Sinon
1650071_10_a
There's one circus act in
particular I had in mind...
Sinon
1650071_9_a
Really? What did you have in mind?
Kirito
1650071_8_a
Still...I think I'd like to work
on a different act.
Sinon
1650071_7_a
...because I think it'll have
some positive effect on my
ground-based skills...
Sinon
1650071_6_a
It's like I said before. I've only
been doing this training here...
Sinon
1650071_5_a
No, but honestly, you were
incredible up on that tightrope.
Kirito
1650071_4_a
Oh... Thanks, Kirito. It was
nothing special. Just some tricks
among teammates.
Sinon
1650071_3_a
Sinon
1650071_2_a
bg_event_circus
Hey, Sinon! Great performance
out there!
Kirito
1650071_1_a
Will do.
Kirito
1650058_27_a
Ah, I suppose that's fair. Come
back if you change your mind!
Kendo Player
1650058_26_a
She's right. We should probably
see what else this world has
to offer us first.
Kirito
1650058_25_a
I, uh, get enough kendo in real
life, thanks...
Leafa
1650058_24_a
You know, you both can really
handle yourselves. Would you
like to join our guild?
Kendo Player
1650058_23_a
You really saved us there.
Thank you.
Kendo Player
1650058_22_a
Whew...
Kirito
1650058_21_a
This time. I'll keep training,
though. I'll take this dojo over
yet!
Challenger
1650058_20_a
We still won, though!
Leafa
1650058_19_a
Same to you. You Thugs have pretty
high strength and stamina.
Kirito
1650058_18_a
Urgh... You two... You're good...
Challenger
1650058_17_a
Kirito
1650058_16_a
Don't forget about me!
Leafa
1650058_15_a
I hope so!
Kirito
1650058_14_a
I'll be on point for our fight,
though!
Challenger
1650058_13_a
Argh, and I worked so hard to get
in character for this role!
Could've been worse, I guess.
Challenger
1650058_12_a
Hah! You don't sound like any dojo
challenger I've ever heard.
Kirito
1650058_11_a
I'm not totally evil. If you let
me smash up this dojo, there might
be some points in it for you.
Challenger
1650058_10_a
Looks like AE leaves plenty of
room for conflict, just like ALO.
Leafa
1650058_9_a
Yep, this is totally a PvP thing.
Asuna said there's a Noble Thief
job class too.
Leafa
1650058_8_a
Every VRMMO needs thugs, right?
Well, here I am! It's a dirty job,
but someone's gotta do it!
Challenger
1650058_7_a
Yeah, more or less. What do you
get out of smashing up all these
dojos?
Kirito
1650058_6_a
Eh? So you're their security?
You tryin' to keep them from
losing their precious budo smarts?
Challenger
1650058_5_a
No, but I intend to fight for
them just the same.
Kirito
1650058_4_a
Leafa
1650058_3_a
Kirito
1650058_2_a
bg_15_kirigaya_dojo
What's your deal? You belong to
this crappy dojo?
Challenger
1650058_1_a
Are you serious?! Kirito, wait!
Leafa
1650057_20_a
Sounds like we need to step up,
Leafa.
Kirito
1650057_19_a
Wow...
Leafa
1650057_18_a
No, only the players in this guild
have it as far as I know.
Kendo Player
1650057_17_a
Do all players have this stat?
Kirito
1650057_16_a
It influences your luck and
various abilities, which in turn
slightly affects your level.
Kendo Player
1650057_15_a
What effect does that stat have?
Kirito
1650057_14_a
And I've heard there's a hidden
stat for budo knowledge that
decreases each time we do that.
Kendo Player
1650057_13_a
Of course we can fight someone who
kicks in the door of our dojo, but
we still break rules when we do.
Kendo Player
1650057_12_a
It's the same in real life too.
Kirito
1650057_11_a
Even setting aside the experience
gap, budo was never meant to
settle personal squabbles.
Kendo Player
1650057_10_a
No, it's not that. Unsanctioned
fighting is strictly forbidden in
budo. It's too dangerous.
Kendo Player
1650057_9_a
Are the odds not in your favor?
Kirito
1650057_8_a
Yeah, and it's causing us a lot
of trouble.
Kendo Player
1650057_7_a
Is this a PvP thing?
Leafa
1650057_6_a
A player. We get these kinds of
challengers every once in a while.
Kendo Player
1650057_5_a
Leafa
1650057_4_a
Is that an NPC or a player?
Kirito
1650057_3_a
Who's in charge here?! I'll take
him down and claim this dumpy
dojo for myself!
Challenger
1650057_2_a
bg_15_kirigaya_dojo
This dojo is mine now!
Challenger
1650057_1_a
That actually happens here?
Kirito
1650055_20_a
What in the world...?
Is this a challenger?
Kendo Player
1650055_19_a
Someone's making a scene at the
entrance.
Leafa
1650055_18_a
What's that about?
Kirito
1650055_17_a
HYAAAAHHHH!
???
1650055_16_a
Sorry about that.
Kendo Player
1650055_15_a
Aww... Yeah, I guess you're right.
I really wanted to pick up a
practice sword, though.
Leafa
1650055_14_a
You heard him. Let's not press our
luck today, Leafa.
Kirito
1650055_13_a
Man, they even follow proper budo
protocols. Are there any details
they haven't nailed?
Kirito
1650055_12_a
Ah, okay... That's fair.
Leafa
1650055_11_a
But seeing as this is our first
practice of the year, I'm gonna
ask that you just watch.
Kendo Player
1650055_10_a
Hmph, not too confident, eh?
Well, we do hold sessions for
non-members every so often...
Kendo Player
1650055_9_a
In real life... Just a little.
Kirito
1650055_8_a
Oh yeah? Do you two have any
experience?
Kendo Player
1650055_7_a
Hey, Mr...uh, Man! This guy says
he wants to join the practice.
Is that okay?
Leafa
1650055_6_a
I mean...
Kirito
1650055_5_a
Well, what about you?
Leafa
1650055_4_a
You want to get in there and mix
it up, don't you?
Kirito
1650055_3_a
Kirito
1650055_2_a
bg_15_kirigaya_dojo
...
Leafa
1650055_1_a
Thanks for sayin' so! Now go on,
enjoy yourselves!
Kendo Player
1650053_20_a
This almost feels too real to be
VR. I'm impressed.
Leafa
1650053_19_a
I know, it's crazy. Right down to
the forms and flow of training.
Leafa
1650053_18_a
Wow, this game is Japanese to the
core. Even their kendo practice
is the real deal.
Kirito
1650053_17_a
It should be entertaining!
Kendo Player
1650053_16_a
It's our first practice of the new
year, so we're sparring with
members from a rival dojo.
Kendo Player
1650053_15_a
Of course! Watch all you want!
Kendo Player
1650053_14_a
Oh, uh, yeah. Is that okay?
Kirito
1650053_13_a
bg_15_kirigaya_dojo
Hi there. You here to watch?
???
1650053_12_a
Leafa
1650053_11_a
Yeah, I'm sure he would!
Leafa
1650053_10_a
Looks like it's a pretty active
kendo guild. Want to stay and
watch for a bit?
Kirito
1650053_9_a
HMPH! HAHHH!
???
1650053_8_a
Whoa, kendo! It's like they've
been spying on us!
Leafa
1650053_7_a
HYAH!
???
1650053_6_a
But what's going on inside?
Kirito
1650053_5_a
Well, if you've seen one dojo,
you've seen most of them, I guess.
Kirito
1650053_4_a
Okay, that's a little creepy.
I didn't think we'd see a building
that looks EXACTLY like our house.
Leafa
1650053_3_a
Leafa
1650053_2_a
bg_15_kirigaya_home
Wait a second. That dojo...
Kirito
1650053_1_a
Yeah, sounds like fun!
Let's go!
Leafa
1650051_16_a
Want to go find out?
Kirito
1650051_15_a
I wonder just how many things
in this area look like places
near our house.
Kirito
1650051_14_a
It totally is! And that tea shop
looks pretty familiar too!
Leafa
1650051_13_a
Like that souvenir shop over
there. It's a dead ringer for the
shop by our house.
Kirito
1650051_12_a
For sure. And the closer I look,
the more similarities I notice.
Kirito
1650051_11_a
Hehe, yeah. SAO, ALO, and GGO
are about as far from Japan-
themed as you can get.
Leafa
1650051_10_a
Yeah, you're spot on there. No
wonder I feel more connected
to this game world.
Kirito
1650051_9_a
Of course you're going to get deja
vu wandering around a castle town
in a Japan-themed VRMMO.
Leafa
1650051_8_a
I'm not surprised. Kawagoe is a
famous historical town. People
call it Little Edo for a reason.
Leafa
1650051_7_a
Whoa, now that you mention it...
You're right!
Kirito
1650051_6_a
Oh yeah, it does kind of look like
our neighborhood.
Leafa
1650051_5_a
I can't shake the feeling that
this town looks familiar.
Kirito
1650051_4_a
What's up, Kirito?
Leafa
1650051_3_a
Leafa
1650051_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Hmm...
Kirito
1650051_1_a
It is. I hope you will play all
the player-made quests you
come across.
Girl
1650048_28_a
It sure sounds that way. It's
wonderful that players can share
so much with one another.
Asuna
1650048_27_a
Lots of people in Asuka Empire
are creating quests based on their
memories and experiences.
Girl
1650048_26_a
It means a lot to me to hear
you say that.
Girl
1650048_25_a
What a fantastic story and a
wonderful memory. I feel all
warm and fuzzy inside.
Asuna
1650048_24_a
That helped with the child motif.
The avatar design looks nothing
like the child, though.
Girl
1650048_23_a
And what of the zashiki-warashi?
Yui
1650048_22_a
Exactly. I made this quest based
on that memory. To create some
sort of closure for it.
Girl
1650048_21_a
Which brings us to this quest.
Asuna
1650048_20_a
That's when it said, "Thank you
for playing with me."
Girl
1650048_19_a
Yes. It was the forgotten child.
I kept following the child's
instructions and made my way out.
Girl
1650048_18_a
You don't mean...?
Asuna
1650048_17_a
That's when I heard the voice.
"Wrong way," it said.
It was the voice of a child.
Girl
1650048_16_a
There wasn't another soul in
sight, but I wasn't afraid. I kept
walking.
Girl
1650048_15_a
Suddenly I realized that I was
on a path lined with torii as
far as the eye could see.
Girl
1650048_14_a
Yes, and the shrine was quite
large. I was walking down a stone
path all by myself.
Girl
1650048_13_a
Oh no, really?
Asuna
1650048_12_a
That's when I got lost.
Girl
1650048_11_a
I started to wonder if I'd been
dreaming. After a while, I started
playing at the shrine again.
Girl
1650048_10_a
I asked all my friends what had
happened, but they had no memory
of the kid.
Girl
1650048_9_a
I remember the kid being pretty
nice to all of us, until one day
the kid was just...gone.
Girl
1650048_8_a
We all assumed this kid was a
friend of a friend and carried
on as usual...
Girl
1650048_7_a
One day a kid we'd never met
before joined our group.
Girl
1650048_6_a
Mmhmm. I spent a lot of time
playing at the shrine near my
house.
Girl
1650048_5_a
Oh?
Asuna
1650048_4_a
Yui
1650048_3_a
Asuna
1650048_2_a
bg_02_forest
It's based on my childhood
experiences.
Girl
1650048_1_a
Oh, of course not.
Girl
1650047_15_a
Would you mind telling me what
you wanted to accomplish with
this quest?
Asuna
1650047_14_a
Heh, is that so? I'm happy to hear
that.
Girl
1650047_13_a
It reminded me of playing tag
as a kid. It was strange and
familiar all at once.
Asuna
1650047_12_a
That's right. So, what did you
think of my quest?
Girl
1650047_11_a
Player-made quests are all the
rage right now. How could I
forget?
Asuna
1650047_10_a
Wait, you made this quest?
Oh, right. I'm in Asuka Empire.
Asuna
1650047_9_a
I'm the designer of this quest.
I made a promise to meet the
first person who cleared it.
Girl
1650047_8_a
Who are you?
Asuna
1650047_7_a
A girl just appeared. It seems
she's another player.
Yui
1650047_6_a
Yui
1650047_5_a
Oh?
Asuna
1650047_4_a
Yui
1650047_3_a
Asuna
1650047_2_a
bg_02_forest
Well done! You caught it.
???
1650047_1_a
I'll probably pay for using torii
as stepping stones later, but for
now I'm just glad it worked!
Asuna
1650045_22_a
Wow! Great job, Mommy!
Yui
1650045_21_a
And just as I thought, running
across the gates was actually
easier than running on that path!
Asuna
1650045_20_a
The gaps between them weren't
that large, which made for easy
jumping.
Asuna
1650045_19_a
Really?!
Yui
1650045_18_a
Hehe, I actually climbed on top of
the torii and jumped from gate
to gate!
Asuna
1650045_17_a
Yay! But how did you get in front
of it like that?
Yui
1650045_16_a
Gotcha! Finally...
Asuna
1650045_15_a
Yui
1650045_14_a
Asuna
1650045_13_a
Hrrrngh...!
Zashiki-warashi
1650045_12_a
Hnyah?!
Zashiki-warashi
1650045_11_a
Come here, you little...!
Asuna
1650045_10_a
O-Okay!
Yui
1650045_9_a
Keep moving, Yui!
We can trap it!
Asuna
1650045_8_a
Asuna
1650045_7_a
Mommy?! How did you get in front
of it?!
Yui
1650045_6_a
You're not getting away this time!
???
1650045_5_a
Hey, quit laughing!
Yui
1650045_4_a
Gehehe!
Zashiki-warashi
1650045_3_a
Hngh... Just waaaiiiiiit!
Yui
1650045_2_a
bg_02_forest
pant
pant
Yui
1650045_1_a
Okay!
Yui
1650043_20_a
I've got an idea, and I just know
it's going to work! Go on ahead!
Asuna
1650043_19_a
Of course. But what are you going
to do, Mommy?
Yui
1650043_18_a
Yui, can you keep chasing after
it for me?
Asuna
1650043_17_a
What?
Yui
1650043_16_a
Oh!
Asuna
1650043_15_a
And this isn't ALO, so we can't
fly...
Asuna
1650043_14_a
Which eliminates wandering off
the path or taking shortcuts.
Yui
1650043_13_a
And the area beyond the torii
gates is off-limits.
Yui
1650043_12_a
But this is just one long, torii-
lined path.
Asuna
1650043_11_a
Well, if this were a game of tag,
we could come in from opposite
sides to trap it.
Asuna
1650043_10_a
We must think of ways to catch up
to it. What would we do if this
were a competition?
Yui
1650043_9_a
Yeah, this stone path is pretty
tough to walk on, though it
doesn't seem to stop that brat.
Asuna
1650043_8_a
I think so too. But we won't catch
up to it if we just keep following
the path.
Yui
1650043_7_a
And I'm almost certain we have to
catch it to clear the quest.
Asuna
1650043_6_a
Based on our past experience,
we'll get returned to the shrine
as soon as we lose sight of it.
Asuna
1650043_5_a
I know... I don't think we can
catch it at this rate...
Yui
1650043_4_a
Yui
1650043_3_a
Argh! It's still as fast as ever!
Asuna
1650043_2_a
bg_02_forest
Hee hee!
Zashiki-warashi
1650043_1_a
Later!
Kirito
1650041_22_a
Asuna
1650041_21_a
Bye, Daddy!
Yui
1650041_20_a
Yui
1650041_19_a
We'd better get going, then.
Bye, Kirito!
Asuna
1650041_18_a
Okay!
Yui
1650041_17_a
Kirito
1650041_16_a
Well, aren't you just full of
energy!
Asuna
1650041_15_a
We should leave for the shrine
soon, Mommy!
Yui
1650041_14_a
Kirito
1650041_13_a
Sure thing, Kirito. Thank you.
That means a lot.
Asuna
1650041_12_a
That doesn't leave me many ways to
help, but let me know if there's
anything I can do.
Kirito
1650041_11_a
Makes sense. And only girls can
take the shrine maiden quest,
right?
Kirito
1650041_10_a
That's why Yui and I are so eager
to tackle this quest ourselves.
Asuna
1650041_9_a
Yeah, but it's not scary at all.
Asuna
1650041_8_a
Wow. That's a pretty cool story.
Something strange has found a
home at the shrine, huh?
Kirito
1650041_7_a
Then, just like that, we were
right back in the shrine where
we started.
Asuna
1650041_6_a
Once we finally managed to get
inside, we ended up chasing a
zashiki-warashi around.
Asuna
1650041_5_a
and this torii dungeon just
appeared out of nowhere in
one part of the shrine.
Asuna
1650041_4_a
Yes. Yui and I are doing a shrine
maiden simulation quest in Asuka
Empire,
Asuna
1650041_3_a
Asuna
1650041_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
A torii dungeon?
Kirito
1650041_1_a
Hehe, you're right! I'll have to
give him a thank-you hug!
Leafa
1650038_17_a
We owe him a debt of gratitude.
Sakuya
1650038_16_a
Ha ha, none of that now!
He helped us out, did he not?
Sakuya
1650038_15_a
I mean, I'm happy we got a tree,
but I feel like I've been dancing
in the palm of his hand...
Leafa
1650038_14_a
sigh
... How is he always one
step ahead of everyone else...?
Leafa
1650038_13_a
Go chop down some spare Christmas
trees by the log cabin! We'll need
them! Or something like that.
Leafa
1650038_12_a
Ahhh, so that's it. He must've
shot Asuna a message.
Leafa
1650038_11_a
But he disappeared in all the
commotion after it broke...
Sakuya
1650038_10_a
I saw Kirito in town while we were
transporting the old tree.
Sakuya
1650038_9_a
Kirito? What makes you say that?
Leafa
1650038_8_a
Hmm... Perhaps Kirito had
something to do with it?
Sakuya
1650038_7_a
How did Asuna know I was looking
for a Christmas tree? I didn't
message her or anything...
Leafa
1650038_6_a
I know what you mean!
Actually... Hold on a sec...
Leafa
1650038_5_a
Ha ha, true. Us old-school ALO
players often forget that the
floating castle is even there.
Sakuya
1650038_4_a
Yup. I tried searching the surface
first, but realized Aincrad had a
way better selection!
Leafa
1650038_3_a
Leafa
1650038_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
I see. So you acquired this tree
from the area around Asuna's log
cabin in Aincrad?
Sakuya
1650038_1_a
Hehe, I'm always happy to help a
friend.
Asuna
1650037_24_a
Whoa, thanks!
You're the best, Asuna!
Leafa
1650037_23_a
I cut down a whole bunch of good
candidates and lined them up over
there for you.
Asuna
1650037_22_a
Hehe, I bet. Well, go on and take
whichever one you like the most!
Asuna
1650037_21_a
Half of the Sylphs are waiting for
me to come back with an awesome
new Christmas tree!
Leafa
1650037_20_a
I wish I could hang out, but I
don't have the time today.
Leafa
1650037_19_a
Well, you're always welcome to
make yourself at home.
Asuna
1650037_18_a
Hey, hope you don't mind the
intrusion! I guess I'm not coming
inside, but still.
Leafa
1650037_17_a
bg_13_coral_lake
Hey there, Leafa!
Asuna
1650037_16_a
B-But...why...?
Recon
1650037_15_a
I'm going to pop over to Aincrad
for a few! See you in a bit!
Leafa
1650037_14_a
What's it?
Recon
1650037_13_a
Wait a sec... Of course!
That's it!
Leafa
1650037_12_a
Huh? A message from Asuna?
Leafa
1650037_11_a
I can't think of any...
Leafa
1650037_10_a
Hmm... Were there any neutral
areas nearby with coniferous
forests in them?
Recon
1650037_9_a
but if we start lumberjacking in
another race's land, it's going to
cause trouble...
Leafa
1650037_8_a
You mean another territory?
The neutral area would be fine,
Leafa
1650037_7_a
I was just trying to help...
Okay, if we can't find one here,
let's just check somewhere else.
Recon
1650037_6_a
You can't just say "cheer up" and
make everything magically better!
Ugh, Sakuya's gonna be so upset...
Leafa
1650037_5_a
But we've been searching for
hours, and still nothing!
Leafa
1650037_4_a
Cheer up, Leafa!
Recon
1650037_3_a
Recon
1650037_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
sigh
...
Leafa
1650037_1_a
Sorry we took your tree, dudes.
But I think you've got good
hearts. Respect.
Player
1650035_17_a
Leafa, I'm moved...
Okay!
Recon
1650035_16_a
So let's look for a tree somewhere
else. Just like irl, we have to
respect nature's limits.
Leafa
1650035_15_a
If we cut down ALL the trees, the
game will probably stop spawning
new ones for good.
Leafa
1650035_14_a
There's always a limit to how much
you can push nature. Or, simulated
video game nature, anyway.
Leafa
1650035_13_a
But...why?
Recon
1650035_12_a
Hold it, Recon. Even if there are
a few left, let's leave them be.
Leafa
1650035_11_a
Oh...which means this area had a
lot of them, huh? Come on, Leafa!
Let's keep looking!
Recon
1650035_10_a
Tons of players were all over this
area during the past couple days,
chopping down Christmas trees.
Player
1650035_9_a
Nah, there's probably a few left
here somewhere. Not many, but
maybe a handful.
Player
1650035_8_a
Yeah, I guess I saw that coming...
That might've been the last tree
around here, too...
Leafa
1650035_7_a
Of course we do! Why else do you
think we're here, a passion for
forestry? This is for Christmas!
Player
1650035_6_a
Umm... Do you guys kinda sorta
need that tree? Because if you're
not gonna take it...
Leafa
1650035_5_a
Huh? Who are you?
Player
1650035_4_a
Recon
1650035_3_a
Excuse me!
Leafa

bg_02_forest
Finally, we got our fir tree!
Player
1650035_1_a
Yeah!
Leafa
1650033_15_a
There's a bunch of players down at
the tree's base! Let's go check
it out!
Recon
1650033_14_a
Ah! It just fell over!
Leafa
1650033_13_a
Gah!!
Recon
1650033_12_a
And...is it just me, or are there
a suspiciously low number of
trees for a forest?
Leafa
1650033_11_a
Hey, it is! But...doesn't
something feel off about
this place?
Leafa
1650033_10_a
Wait a sec, Leafa!
Isn't that a fir tree?
Recon
1650033_9_a
Oh, that's a good point...
Leafa
1650033_8_a
Sylph territory is pretty hot and
humid. They don't grow in this
climate...
Recon
1650033_7_a
But there aren't any conifers
growing in this forest. Not that
I've seen, anyway...
Recon
1650033_6_a
Excuses, excuses! Come on, and
help me find this tree already!
Leafa
1650033_5_a
B-But you're one of the fastest
players in all of ALO! No one can
keep up with you!
Recon
1650033_4_a
Hurry it up, Recon! You insisted
on tagging along, but I'm ditching
you if you slow me down!
Leafa
1650033_3_a
L-Leaaafa, waaait up!!
Recon
1650033_2_a
bg_02_forest
If I remember right, there's
a lot of fir trees in the Sylph
territory's ancient forest area...
Leafa
1650033_1_a
Thank you, Leafa.
All of Sylvain is in your debt.
Sakuya
1650031_18_a
Oh, so that's why you called me!
Of course, I'd love to help!
Leafa
1650031_17_a
And so, we come to my request.
Can you find us a new Christmas
tree?
Sakuya
1650031_16_a
It's not a Sylph Christmas unless
we've got that giant tree!
Leafa
1650031_15_a
Wh-What do we do now, Sakuya?!
Leafa
1650031_14_a
Then, when we were transporting
it to the central plaza, it
just...poof.
Sakuya
1650031_13_a
But it seems my vault wasn't
suited for tree storage. The fir
rotted and its durability dropped.
Sakuya
1650031_12_a
Massive objects can't be placed in
personal inventories, so I had it
stored in my private vault...
Sakuya
1650031_11_a
WHAT?! B-But...my Christmas...
Whyyyyyy?!
Leafa
1650031_10_a
Well, the giant fir tree we put
in the center of Sylvain...has
been split in twain.
Sakuya
1650031_9_a
It's totally beautiful, and I'm SO
looking forward to it this year!
Leafa
1650031_8_a
Yeah! The one all of us decorate,
and then we illuminate it at night
and everything?
Leafa
1650031_7_a
You know about the giant Christmas
tree we put up in the center of
Sylvain every year, right?
Sakuya
1650031_6_a
Yes... In a way.
Sakuya
1650031_5_a
It's totally fine! I dived as soon
as you messaged me. It's urgent,
right?
Leafa
1650031_4_a
Ah, you're here. Sorry for calling
you on such short notice.
Sakuya
1650031_3_a
Sakuya
1650031_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
What is it, Sakuya?!
What's the problem?!
Leafa
1650031_1_a
Perhaps.
Alice
1650018_18_a
Oh, don't be a sourpuss. I think
the kid learned its lesson.
Asuna
1650018_17_a
And you think this absolves it
of its past misdeeds?
Alice
1650018_16_a
It's a really unique piece of
equipment! It's real strong,
so I think I'll try it on.
Asuna
1650018_15_a
Hmph. So, what did that gremlin hand
you before it scampered off?
Alice
1650018_14_a
Hehe, well, all's well that ends
well, right?
Asuna
1650018_13_a
Then why didn't it just come out
and say so when we caught it?
It makes no sense...
Alice
1650018_12_a
It was probably hoping to attract
the attention of people who could
help... Like us.
Asuna
1650018_11_a
If it walked into town, the
villagers would have either
run in fear or strung it up.
Asuna
1650018_10_a
Sneaking about the countryside and
causing property damage is a cry
for help?
Alice
1650018_9_a
Besides, all those acts of
mischief were probably a
cry for help.
Asuna
1650018_8_a
Oh, be nice. It was just a kid.
Asuna
1650018_7_a
Why did you show that creature
mercy? It deserved death.
Alice
1650018_6_a
Wait...
Alice
1650018_5_a
You're welcome, and bye-bye!
Just try not to fall again, okay?
Asuna
1650018_4_a
Alice
1650018_3_a
Asuna
1650018_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Thanks, ladies!
You're good people!
Gremlin
1650018_1_a
I ain't sayin' nothin'!
Gremlin
1650017_21_a
You fell from the castle and
can't get back up, can you?
Asuna
1650017_20_a
Wait...
Asuna
1650017_19_a
E-Eep!
Gremlin
1650017_18_a
As I thought, your motives are
foul. You will die now.
Alice
1650017_17_a
Why? Duh! We gremlins gotta cause
mischief! It's like, in our job
description!
Gremlin
1650017_16_a
So, could you tell me why
you did it?
Asuna
1650017_15_a
H-Hey, Alice, hold up.
We don't have to go that far...
Asuna
1650017_14_a
Eep?
Gremlin
1650017_13_a
Foul demon.
Do you have any last words?
Alice
1650017_12_a
You used magic back there, so my
guess is an invisibility or
camouflage spell. Right?
Asuna
1650017_11_a
That's an admission of guilt
if I ever heard one.
Asuna
1650017_10_a
I ain't sayin' nothin'!
Gremlin
1650017_9_a
You are the one responsible for
terrorizing the village, correct?
Alice
1650017_8_a
Let me go, you big oafs!
I'll bite you! See that I won't!
Gremlin
1650017_7_a
This isn't a fairy...
I think it's a gremlin?
Asuna
1650017_6_a
This little creature is our
villain?
Alice
1650017_5_a
Er...
Asuna
1650017_4_a
Alice
1650017_3_a
Asuna
1650017_2_a
bg_02_forest
C-Curses!
???
1650017_1_a
They shall not escape justice!
Alice
1650015_26_a
So that's their hideout...
Come on! We can catch them!
Asuna
1650015_25_a
Your beacon is leading us to
that copse of trees!
Alice
1650015_24_a
Come on, let's go!
Asuna
1650015_23_a
...Over there! Follow my tracking
beacon! That's where we'll find
our troublemaker!
Asuna
1650015_22_a
Understood! My blade is ready!
Alice
1650015_21_a
I'm going to cast a tracking
spell that should lead us to
our culprit!
Asuna
1650015_20_a
Alice! Stay alert and keep me safe
for a minute!
Asuna
1650015_19_a
That's right! The culprit must
be nearby!
Asuna
1650015_18_a
True. We only arrived a few minu-
OH!
Alice
1650015_17_a
It's only been a few minutes since
we last saw the sign!
Asuna
1650015_16_a
Perhaps... Wait a sec!
Asuna
1650015_15_a
Just what's going on here?
Are fiends from the Dread Bastion
responsible for this outrage?!
Alice
1650015_14_a
Dread Vale...?
Asuna
1650015_13_a
When in the world did it become
"Dread Vale"?!
Alice
1650015_12_a
What?! But that's...
You're right! When we arrived,
it clearly said "Orchard Vale."
Alice
1650015_11_a
The village's sign!
It's different!
Asuna
1650015_10_a
What is it?!
Alice
1650015_9_a
Huh?!
Asuna
1650015_8_a
Sure thing...
Alice
1650015_7_a
Okay, that's not promising...
Let's try a pass through the
village together this time. 
Asuna
1650015_6_a
I found the same. None of the
villagers seemed particularly
suspicious to me either.
Alice
1650015_5_a
On the surface at least, it's just
an ordinary, peaceful village...
Asuna
1650015_4_a
Not one... I searched every
corner of the village, but I
didn't see anything unusual.
Asuna
1650015_3_a
Asuna
1650015_2_a
bg_05_danac
Uncovered any clues yet, Asuna?
Alice
1650015_1_a
Yeah!
Asuna
1650013_19_a
Asuna! Let us track down and
expose this scoundrel!
Alice
1650013_18_a
This ne'er-do-well sows chaos and
discord. Rarely have I heard of
deeds so nefarious.
Alice
1650013_17_a
Really? That's a logical leap...
But sure, I guess.
Asuna
1650013_16_a
After seeing your skill in battle,
I knew you'd have the courage and
wisdom to find who's responsible.
Fairy NPC
1650013_15_a
Hmm... Actually, it sounds like
the work of a mischievous kid.
Asuna
1650013_14_a
Hmm... This sounds like the work
of a true villain, a scoundrel who
delights in causing misfortune.
Alice
1650013_13_a
What?! This is actually 
really mean-spirited...
Asuna
1650013_12_a
Stranger yet, we found tables set
in the middle of the night and
furniture rearranged haphazardly.
Fairy NPC
1650013_11_a
In other words, the culprit had
motives other than hunger?
Alice
1650013_10_a
We found piles of fruit ripped
from the trees, but there were
no signs any were eaten.
Fairy NPC
1650013_9_a
That's what we thought at first.
However...we were wrong.
Fairy NPC
1650013_8_a
That sounds like the work of
monsters, or some wild beast.
Asuna
1650013_7_a
Our fields have been torn up,
and our livestock's halters have
been found severed...
Fairy NPC
1650013_6_a
Such as?
Asuna
1650013_5_a
Let me explain. Recently, our
village has been beset by a
string of strange events...
Fairy NPC
1650013_4_a
I saw a sign on the way in.
It's called "Orchard Vale."
Asuna
1650013_3_a
Asuna
1650013_2_a
bg_05_danac
So this is her village...
Nice place.
Alice
1650013_1_a
And...I would request your aid,
if you are willing to give it...
Fairy NPC
1650011_18_a
I saw the way you handled those
ferocious monsters... You were
incredible!
Fairy NPC
1650011_17_a
Mommy, it's an NPC.
Yui
1650011_16_a
Hmm? Who's this?
Asuna
1650011_15_a
Umm, excuse me?
???
1650011_14_a
sigh
... I give up.
Alice
1650011_13_a
You don't? I mean... Look at them!
How can you hate those faces?
Asuna
1650011_12_a
Cute? Hardly. Honestly, I don't
know what you or Eugeo find "cute"
about these repulsive things.
Alice
1650011_11_a
Hehe, I guess they are kinda
cute, aren't they?
Asuna
1650011_10_a
Hmm... Perhaps. At least these
fiends are easily distinguishable
from the common earthbound beasts.
Alice
1650011_9_a
Yeah, it is weird. Maybe they
jumped down?
Asuna
1650011_8_a
But I wonder how the creatures of
the Dread Bastion, airborne as it
is, made it down here...
Alice
1650011_7_a
Yes. My enemies lie defeated.
Alice
1650011_6_a
Alice
1650011_5_a
Everything okay over there, Alice?
Asuna
1650011_4_a
Phew...
Alice
1650011_3_a
Gnnnnrk!!
Demon
1650011_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Hyaaah!!
Alice
1650011_1_a
Konechno!
Seven
1640198_36_a
I can't wait! We have so much lost
time to make up for!
Rain
1640198_35_a
Right! Ehehe, now you're getting
ME all excited!
Seven
1640198_34_a
Or have lunch together
or go shopping together...!
Rain
1640198_33_a
but now we can hang out around
town or go for walks together...
Seven
1640198_32_a
We always had to rush through
quests because I never had time,
Seven
1640198_31_a
Let's do a ton of stuff together,
in real life and ALO!
Seven
1640198_30_a
This is a dream come true for me!
Rain
1640198_29_a
Yes... Yes! Oh, Seven,
I'm so excited!
Rain
1640198_28_a
But we can meet up here in ALO
whenever we want!
Seven
1640198_27_a
I mean, we could also meet up in
real life, schedules permitting.
Seven
1640198_26_a
Yep! We can meet up in ALO every
day now!
Seven
1640198_25_a
Y-You will?!
Rain
1640198_24_a
And I'll be working there while
it gets off the ground!
Seven
1640198_23_a
We're going to start researching
Japan's virtual reality games!
Seven
1640198_22_a
Are you serious?!
Rain
1640198_21_a
My research facility is opening up
a Japanese branch!
Seven
1640198_20_a
R-Ready for what?
Rain
1640198_19_a
Hehehehe.
Are you ready for this?
Seven
1640198_18_a
Oh, right! That.
Seven
1640198_17_a
So... What did you want to tell us
back there?
Rain
1640198_16_a
That's okay.
Rain
1640198_15_a
Well, I'm sorry I lashed out like
I did.
Seven
1640198_14_a
S-So that's what happened...
Okay...
Seven
1640198_13_a
What I said was hurtful.
I'm sorry.
Rain
1640198_12_a
I just have a hard time telling
you that, so I lied. Harshly.
Rain
1640198_11_a
You...what?
Seven
1640198_10_a
Well... I was actually telling
them that I wanted to spend
more time with you.
Rain
1640198_9_a
Remember how I said we were
talking about you?
Rain
1640198_8_a
Uh-huh...
Seven
1640198_7_a
Seven
1640198_6_a
I shouldn't have said what
I did back there. That was
my fault.
Rain
1640198_5_a
Wait! Don't run off!
Rain
1640198_4_a
Gah!
Seven
1640198_3_a
Seven?
Rain
1640198_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
...
Seven
1640198_1_a
Yep!
Rain
1640197_48_a
Asuna
1640197_47_a
Kirito
1640197_46_a
Here's hoping you can bring her
back to us quickly!
Leafa
1640197_45_a
Leafa
1640197_44_a
Asuna
1640197_43_a
Good idea.
Kirito
1640197_42_a
Hehe! Okay, I'll go talk to Seven.
Rain
1640197_41_a
Kirito
1640197_40_a
Leafa
1640197_39_a
Oh shoot! I've said too much!
Asuna
1640197_38_a
Hehe, thanks for sharing that,
Asuna.
Rain
1640197_37_a
Kirito
1640197_36_a
Leafa
1640197_35_a
That makes me wonder if Kirito
and I will ever stop arguing...
Asuna
1640197_34_a
Isn't that just proof that you get
along TOO well?
Asuna
1640197_33_a
Kirito
1640197_32_a
Asuna
1640197_31_a
Ha ha, how many times do I have
to tell you that's not true? We
fight all the time!
Leafa
1640197_30_a
And from a guy who actually gets
along with his sister!
Rain
1640197_29_a
Ha ha, I've gotta hand it to you.
You've got serious persuasive
powers.
Rain
1640197_28_a
You've got a point there, Kirito.
Rain
1640197_27_a
Asuna
1640197_26_a
Leafa
1640197_25_a
So you should probably make the
most of the time you do get in VR.
Right?
Kirito
1640197_24_a
Or you'll just separate naturally
once you get older and start
leading your own lives.
Kirito
1640197_23_a
Something like SAO could happen
again and rip you apart.
Kirito
1640197_22_a
Asuna
1640197_21_a
Leafa
1640197_20_a
Just keep in mind that she won't
be around forever. You should
enjoy the time you have.
Kirito
1640197_19_a
Y-Yeah, but that's
Rain
1640197_18_a
Asuna
1640197_17_a
Kirito
1640197_16_a
You want to spend more time with
your sister, don't you?
Leafa
1640197_15_a
Asuna
1640197_14_a
Kirito
1640197_13_a
Besides, you told us all how
you really feel.
Leafa
1640197_12_a
...
Rain
1640197_11_a
Kirito
1640197_9_a
But that's all the more reason
to patch things up quickly.
Leafa
1640197_8_a
Asuna
1640197_10_a
Asuna
1640197_7_a
Kirito
1640197_6_a
Sure, that was a fight over
nothing just now.
Leafa
1640197_5_a
Leafa, you don't
Rain
1640197_4_a
Asuna
1640197_3_a
Kirito
1640197_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Listen, Rain... I think you should
go after Seven. Talk to her.
Leafa
1640197_1_a
Leafa
1640195_48_a
Asuna
1640195_47_a
But...
Kirito
1640195_46_a
Genius or not, she's still a kid.
She'll come around just as
fast as she got upset.
Rain
1640195_45_a
Whatever. That's just how sisters
talk to each other sometimes.
Rain
1640195_44_a
...
Rain
1640195_43_a
Kirito
1640195_42_a
Leafa
1640195_41_a
Is that what you wanted, Rain?
Asuna
1640195_40_a
Asuna
1640195_39_a
Leafa
1640195_38_a
Seven, wait!
Kirito
1640195_37_a
Rain
1640195_36_a
I came here to tell you something
really awesome, but you can
forget about that now!
Seven
1640195_35_a
So that's how you talk about
me behind my back, huh!
Seven
1640195_34_a
What?!
UGH, you are the WORST!
Seven
1640195_33_a
We were talking about how much
of a BRAT you are, despite being
an idol AND a professor!
Rain
1640195_32_a
Why am I getting left out?
YOU were the ones talking about
ME!
Seven
1640195_31_a
Seriously?! You're gonna say you
were talking and then not tell me?
Seven
1640195_30_a
I-It's not that big a deal!
Rain
1640195_29_a
Rain
1640195_28_a
I wasn't talking to you!
Tell me, tell me!
Seven
1640195_27_a
Kirito
1640195_26_a
Asuna
1640195_25_a
E-Er, yeah. Right.
Leafa
1640195_24_a
Seven
1640195_23_a
Gaaaaah! We can talk about
that later! Can't we, Leafa!
Rain
1640195_22_a
Rain
1640195_21_a
C'mon, I'm on the edge of my seat!
Seven
1640195_20_a
Kirito
1640195_19_a
Asuna
1640195_18_a
Well...
Leafa
1640195_17_a
Rain
1640195_16_a
Oh yeah? What were you saying?
Seven
1640195_15_a
Kirito
1640195_14_a
Asuna
1640195_13_a
Nice! We were just talking about
you!
Leafa
1640195_12_a
Rain
1640195_11_a
Sure am! I noticed you guys were
online, so I came to find you!
Seven
1640195_10_a
Kirito
1640195_9_a
Leafa
1640195_8_a
Are you in Japan right now?
Asuna
1640195_7_a
Asuna
1640195_6_a
Leafa
1640195_5_a
What the
?! Seven?!
Kirito
1640195_4_a
Seven
1640195_3_a
Huh?
Rain
1640195_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Privyet!
Seven
1640195_1_a
Asuna
1640193_35_a
That's okay. I'm just glad you
took the time to think up some
ideas. Thank you.
Rain
1640193_34_a
Kirito
1640193_33_a
Sorry we couldn't come up with
anything earth-shattering...
Leafa
1640193_32_a
Leafa
1640193_31_a
Yeah, sure thing.
Kirito
1640193_30_a
Asuna
1640193_29_a
So I'd appreciate if you guys
could keep this quiet... Heh.
Rain
1640193_28_a
Besides, it causes problems
every time I tell her I want
to be with her.
Rain
1640193_27_a
As much as I miss her, I'll just
have to deal with the fact that
we live half a world apart.
Rain
1640193_26_a
Thanks, guys. I appreciate all the
brainstorming you're doing.
Rain
1640193_25_a
Rain
1640193_24_a
They should just open it up to
all regions like GGO does.
Asuna
1640193_23_a
Leafa
1640193_22_a
If word got out, it'd tank their
reputation.
Kirito
1640193_21_a
Nah, they could totally pull it
off. But it's against ALO's rules.
Kirito
1640193_20_a
Oh no? What? You think they can't?
Leafa
1640193_19_a
Leafa
1640193_18_a
There'd have to be at least a
couple programmers on staff...
but there's no way they'd do it.
Kirito
1640193_17_a
Rain
1640193_16_a
Doesn't Seven's research have
more to do with neurology,
though?
Asuna
1640193_15_a
Asuna
1640193_14_a
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Rain
1640193_13_a
Kirito
1640193_12_a
they can come up with some way
to access ALO's servers from
the US.
Leafa
1640193_11_a
Maybe if she asks them all to
put their heads together,
Leafa
1640193_9_a
Kirito
1640193_10_a
Asuna
1640193_8_a
Well...yeah. That's the impression
I get, anyway.
Rain
1640193_7_a
Kirito
1640193_6_a
Well, Seven's pretty much
surrounded by researcher-
types in real life, right?
Leafa
1640193_5_a
Asuna
1640193_4_a
Hm? What about it?
Rain
1640193_3_a
Kirito
1640193_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Rain, about that chat we all had
earlier...
Leafa
1640193_1_a
Leafa
1640191_33_a
Hey, Rain...
Kirito
1640191_32_a
Asuna
1640191_31_a
Huh...
Rain
1640191_30_a
We're so close that I can even
talk to him about things I don't
mention to my own parents!
Asuna
1640191_29_a
Rain
1640191_28_a
I've got an older brother at home
myself. I think older brothers
are the best.
Asuna
1640191_27_a
Leafa
1640191_26_a
Yeah, I guess with ALO being
Japan-only, there aren't many
opportunities for her to play.
Kirito
1640191_25_a
Asuna
1640191_24_a
We don't even get to see each
other in this world unless she
happens to be in Japan.
Rain
1640191_23_a
Asuna
1640191_22_a
It still counts, though.
Seven and I have never
even lived together.
Rain
1640191_21_a
Kirito
1640191_20_a
I mean, we're arguing right now!
Leafa
1640191_19_a
Yeah! And it's not like we
ACTUALLY get along!
Leafa
1640191_18_a
Leafa
1640191_17_a
But...I thought you and
Seven made up already.
Kirito
1640191_16_a
Asuna
1640191_15_a
Oh, er, yeah... Just thinking
about how nice it is that you
two get along.
Rain
1640191_14_a
Is everything okay, Rain?
Asuna
1640191_13_a
...
Rain
1640191_12_a
Hehehe, you really do.
Rain
1640191_11_a
Hahaha! You two talk about the
real world way too much.
Asuna
1640191_9_a
Rain
1640191_10_a
Leafa
1640191_8_a
Mom's gonna kill me!
Kirito
1640191_7_a
Oh, crap! I totally forgot!
Kirito
1640191_6_a
Did you also get more
toothbrushes?
Leafa
1640191_5_a
Oh, cool. Thanks!
Leafa
1640191_4_a
Yeah, I bought some this
afternoon.
Kirito
1640191_3_a
Kirito
1640191_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Wait... Are there any eggs
left in the fridge?
Leafa
1640191_1_a
Kirito! You are seriously pushing
your luck!!
Asuna
1640188_21_a
M-Maybe we could try that out
in real life someday...
Kirito
1640188_20_a
R-Right! I thought so too.
Kirito
1640188_19_a
But, Mommy, it was sweet to see
you looking after Daddy like that.
Yui
1640188_18_a
Well, that's only
because it got weird!
Asuna
1640188_17_a
Wow, Daddy! You can pinpoint
the second Mommy stopped
calling you "master."
Yui
1640188_16_a
Phew! That was close...
Kirito
1640188_15_a
Oh well...
A passable effort, nonetheless.
Head Maid
1640188_14_a
...
Head Maid
1640188_13_a
gulp
Kirito
1640188_12_a
After a certain point, it looks
like you barely gave any
instructions at all.
Head Maid
1640188_11_a
At first you were doing well
assigning maid tasks, but then...
Head Maid
1640188_10_a
It looks like you're getting
graded for your work here, Daddy.
Yui
1640188_9_a
Huh?
Asuna
1640188_8_a
However...there's one thing that
bothers me about your tenure as
temporary estate manager.
Head Maid
1640188_7_a
Phew....
Kirito
1640188_6_a
Well, looks like your
work here is done.
Asuna
1640188_5_a
D-Don't mention it...
Kirito
1640188_4_a
Asuna
1640188_3_a
Kirito
1640188_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
I can't thank you enough for
filling in during my absence.
Head Maid
1640188_1_a
Ha ha...
Kirito
1640187_25_a
Kirito, I'm never calling you
"master" ever again! Got it?!
Asuna
1640187_24_a
Y-Yeah, I know... But now I feel
really embarrassed!
Asuna
1640187_23_a
It's just a silly side-quest
in a VRMMO, remember?
Kirito
1640187_22_a
C-Calm down there, Asuna...
Kirito
1640187_21_a
I, er... Well, um...! Because
I would never! Not in a
million years...!
Asuna
1640187_20_a
Mommy?
Why are you so flustered?
Yui
1640187_19_a
Y-Yui! You don't need to learn
that kind of stuff!
Asuna
1640187_18_a
I read on the internet that some
couples in the real world like
to play those kinds of games.
Yui
1640187_17_a
O-Oh no...!
Asuna
1640187_16_a
Asuna
1640187_15_a
Waah!! Yui, where in the world
did you learn about that?!
Kirito
1640187_14_a
Oh! Is this like some kind of
role-playing game for couples?
Yui
1640187_13_a
If you say so, Mommy...
Yui
1640187_12_a
I'm having fun too! I like doing
maid things like this.
Asuna
1640187_11_a
Ahaha! It's all right, Yui.
Asuna
1640187_10_a
Unless I regularly give the maids
orders, I won't be doing my job
and I'll get penalized, right?
Kirito
1640187_9_a
B-But that's what I'm supposed
to do, right?
Kirito
1640187_8_a
Daddy... Don't you think you're
working Mommy too hard?
Yui
1640187_7_a
Alright, then. When I'm done
here, I'll take it to Liz!
Asuna
1640187_6_a
And after that, this sword could
use some maintenance...
Kirito
1640187_5_a
Y-Yes, of course!
Allow me, master.
Asuna
1640187_4_a
Yui
1640187_3_a
Asuna
1640187_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Asuna...
My shoulders are a bit sore...
Kirito
1640187_1_a
Did I do that right?
Kirito
1640185_20_a
Y-Yes, sir!
Understood.
Right away, master!
Asuna
1640185_19_a
Asuna!
G-Go and, um, make some tea!
Kirito
1640185_18_a
I'm so nervous...
Asuna
1640185_17_a
What?! You gotta be kidding me...
Um, okay, then...
Kirito
1640185_16_a
And it looks like you could get
penalized if you don't periodically
give the maids instructions.
Yui
1640185_15_a
That's what it says! What is
this?! How am I supposed to be a
"gentlemanly master"?
Kirito
1640185_14_a
Huh? Wh-What kind of a joke
is that...?
Asuna
1640185_13_a
Be a gentlemanly master and
give instructions to the maids?!
Kirito
1640185_12_a
What?!
Kirito
1640185_11_a
Hmm, let's see...
Kirito
1640185_10_a
Oh! It just popped up.
Kirito
1640185_9_a
Daddy, wasn't there a new
information screen?
Yui
1640185_8_a
Yui
1640185_7_a
Asuna
1640185_6_a
So...
What exactly do I have to do?
Kirito
1640185_5_a
Head Maid
1640185_4_a
Y-Yes, ma'am.
I'll do my best.
Kirito
1640185_3_a
Kirito
1640185_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Please take good care of the
estate while I'm gone, Mr. Kirito.
Head Maid
1640185_1_a
Right!
Yui
1640183_16_a
Still, the first step
is asking Kirito.
Asuna
1640183_15_a
I guess not everyone in the real
world is cut out to be an
aristocrat...
Yui
1640183_14_a
So I can't help but
be a little worried.
Asuna
1640183_13_a
It's not like the jobs we do here
have nothing to do with chores
in the real world.
Asuna
1640183_12_a
That's true...
But like I said before...
Asuna
1640183_11_a
So I'm sure it won't be
as hard as the real thing.
Yui
1640183_10_a
The game is set up so
the tasks you're doing are
simplified, Mommy.
Yui
1640183_9_a
It's meant to be a job for the
nobility, so I wonder if a player
can even do it...
Asuna
1640183_8_a
That's a good question...
Yui
1640183_7_a
But what exactly does an "estate
manager" do, I wonder...
Asuna
1640183_6_a
Yeah! I'm sure Daddy would do it!
Yui
1640183_5_a
Yeah, that sounds right.
I think I'll ask Kirito.
Asuna
1640183_4_a
one of your friends to fill in
for her and act as the
estate manager.
Yui
1640183_3_a
Asuna
1640183_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
It seems like the head maid
wants you to choose
Yui
1640183_1_a
I, er... Um, alright.
I'll think about it.
Asuna
1640181_25_a
Yes. I need a reliable person who
can handle household affairs
while I'm away.
Head Maid
1640181_24_a
Huh?! Someone who could
manage the estate?
Asuna
1640181_23_a
So, could I ask you to introduce
someone who could manage the
estate while I'm gone?
Head Maid
1640181_22_a
I see...
Asuna
1640181_21_a
The local nobility will be
holding an important meeting,
and my attendance is required.
Head Maid
1640181_20_a
But what in the world could cause
the master of the estate to leave?
Yui
1640181_19_a
that the head maid is actually
the master of this estate.
Yui
1640181_18_a
We learned in the event quest
the other day
Yui
1640181_17_a
What? Ma'am, you will?!
Asuna
1640181_16_a
As it so happens, I'll be leaving
the estate for a little while...
Head Maid
1640181_15_a
Looks like you're
getting a side quest!
Yui
1640181_14_a
Yes, ma'am.
How can I help?
Asuna
1640181_13_a
Miss Asuna, I have
a request for you.
Head Maid
1640181_12_a
Hmmm, I see...
So that's what you mean.
Yui
1640181_11_a
Things like perception, hand-eye
coordination... It's kind of like
feeling your EXP going up!
Asuna
1640181_10_a
Building skills here helps
you in the real world?
Yui
1640181_9_a
This is getting really exciting!
Asuna
1640181_8_a
Hehe! I guess so!
And maxing out maid skills here
might help out in the real world.
Asuna
1640181_7_a
That's right, Mommy. You've
improved a lot of different maid
skills lately.
Yui
1640181_6_a
Oh, uh...
Thank you, ma'am.
Asuna
1640181_5_a
Recently you've not only outdone
yourself as a kitchen maid, but
you've flourished in many areas.
Head Maid
1640181_4_a
Thank you very much,
Miss Asuna.
Head Maid
1640181_3_a
Head Maid
1640181_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
I'm done with the laundry, ma'am.
Asuna
1640181_1_a
Alllright! Now that that's over,
let's go find ourselves another
fairy tale!
Yuuki
1640178_24_a
R-Right, I'm glad you've cheered
up... Ahaha, really, I am!
Leafa
1640178_23_a
I got to unleash all that pent-up
frustration I built up earlier on
in this dumb quest!
Yuuki
1640178_22_a
Oh man, that was awesome! It was
all worth it for that final
payoff!
Yuuki
1640178_21_a
Y-Yuuki?! Are you okay?!
Leafa
1640178_20_a
Heh... Hehe... Ahahahaha!!
Yuuki
1640178_19_a
R-Right... Well, I'm glad you and
Grandma are both okay.
Leafa
1640178_18_a
Glad to hear it, Grandma. I feel
much better now. Having to act
all useless was the WORST.
Yuuki
1640178_17_a
Yes, Little Red Riding Hood.
All thanks to you.
Grandmother

Grandma, you okay?

GRRRRRRAAAGHHH!!

Ah! Wolfy's hurting again!

"It looks like they based this
Little Red Riding Hood off the
brutal original..." Annnd "Send."
Leafa

Umm... "Grimms' Fairy Tales were
originally pretty dark. The ones
we know were remade for kids."
Leafa

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT ENDS WITH
ME EATEN?!"
Leafa

Oh, I got another message
from Yuuki!

so good...

Grrngh? Nnngrrrgh?!
Wolf
1640177_23_a
Annnd "Send"!
Leafa
1640177_22_a
Wh-What do I do?!
Ack! I need to tell Yuuki!
Leafa
1640177_21_a
But if that's the one they're
following here...
Leafa
1640177_20_a
A variation of the tale ends with
Little Red Riding Hood and her
grandma still inside the wolf...
Leafa
1640177_19_a
Hmm, wait a sec...
If I remember right...
Leafa
1640177_18_a
That's what I wanna know, Yuuki...
Leafa
1640177_17_a
"Chillin' in the wolf's stomach.
What's this about the story being
over? Explanation. NOW!!"
Leafa
1640177_16_a
From YUUKI?!
Leafa
1640177_15_a
Wh-Wh-What do we do?! W-Wait,
I just got a new message?
Leafa
1640177_14_a
B-But why?! It's not over yet!
Leafa
1640177_13_a
Wait, whaaat?!
We beat the story?!
Leafa
1640177_12_a
Annny minute now...
Huh? A dialogue window just
popped up.
Leafa
1640177_11_a
B-But this is how the story goes.
Any minute that hunter will come
and save her...

Whoa! The wolf ate Yuuki in

But, grandmother, what big ears
you have!

Fiiiiiine...
Yuuki

Now let's get this over with
already!
Leafa
1640175_27_a
I'm sure the next fairy tale will
be super fun, so just deal with
this one for now. Okay?!
Leafa
1640175_26_a
But come ooon! This is SO BORING!
Yuuki
1640175_25_a
Not in this story! It ruins the
whole plot!
Leafa
1640175_24_a
A protagonist's gotta be all
dynamic and spirited and gung-ho!
Yuuki
1640175_23_a
But, Leafa, this role's the WORST!
I'm not cut out to play this sort
of passive personality!

please?! You're stressing me out
here!

Fiiine...

Ah, hahaha... Y-Yuuki, stop
fussing already! Come ON!
Leafa
1640175_18_a
Sorry. I got a schedule to keep.
Yuuki
1640175_17_a
Why not pluck a few for your
grandmother? I'm sure she'd be
delighted at such a fine gift.
Wolf
1640175_16_a
Just over there you'll find a
meadow filled with beautiful
flowers.
Wolf
1640175_15_a
I see, I see... So this is where
she lives. Hmm... Ahh, yes. I have
a present for you, little girl.
Wolf
1640175_14_a
Leafa
1640175_13_a

Fine. Here, I'll show you
a map. Is that good enough for
you?
Yuuki

Gaaah! Yuuki! Stop it already!

...On a tiny island waaay far
across the sea.

Oho! You have a grandmother.
I see, I see... Pray tell, where
does she live?
Wolf

My grandma's house.

I couldn't hear you, little girl.
Tell me, where are you going?
Wolf

Y-Yuuki! What are you doing?!
Leafa
1640175_5_a
Err... I can't just tell a total
stranger a thing like that, can I?

Where are you going, little girl?
Wolf
1640175_1_a
Right on cue.
Leafa
1640173_20_a
Ah! A wolf!
Yuuki
1640173_19_a
Leafa
1640173_18_a
Yuuki
1640173_17_a
Well, what do we have here?
A scrumptiously cute little girl!
???
1640173_16_a
Y-Yeah, I guess you're right...
Yuuki
1640173_15_a
Otherwise, we might not be able
to collect this fairy tale.
Leafa
1640173_14_a
Ahaha, I see what you're getting
at. But I think we should just
follow the script, Yuuki.
Leafa
1640173_13_a
Doesn't this story leave you
feeling kinda hollow?
Yuuki
1640173_12_a
Hmm... I guess you're right.
Leafa
1640173_11_a
she gets tricked and eaten by an
evil beast. She doesn't make a
very good heroine, huh?
Yuuki
1640173_10_a
So Little Red Riding Hood doesn't
just break her promise to her mom,
Yuuki
1640173_9_a
A hunter ends up having to save
her from the wolf's tummy.
Leafa
1640173_8_a
Yeah. Then Little Red Riding Hood
gets gobbled up when she gets
there too.
Leafa
1640173_7_a
While she's playing, the wolf goes
on ahead and gobbles up poor old
grandma...
Yuuki
1640173_6_a
She breaks her promise with her
mother and goofs off on her way
to her grandma's.
Yuuki
1640173_5_a
Well, the story goes that Little
Red Riding Hood gets fooled by
the Big Bad Wolf.
Yuuki
1640173_4_a
Yuuki, what's got you down in the
dumps?
Leafa
1640173_3_a
Leafa
1640173_2_a
bg_18_mountain
sigh
...
Yuuki
1640173_1_a
Y-Yes, ma'am.
Yuuki
1640171_20_a
Take this map and head straight
there. No fooling around!
Woman
1640171_19_a
Yay, Yuuki! Nice going! Now let's
get that basket to Grandma!
Leafa
1640171_18_a
Sure.
Yuuki
1640171_17_a
To your grandmother's house.
Please, bring her this basket.
Woman
1640171_16_a
Umm... Okay, sure, Mom. Where
should I go?
Yuuki
1640171_15_a
Yup, and it picked you to be the
heroine! Go on, answer the lady!
Leafa
1640171_14_a
Which means we started a new
fairy tale?
Yuuki
1640171_13_a
Wow, congrats, Yuuki! It looks
like you're Little Red Riding
Hood!
Leafa
1640171_12_a
Umm, Leafa? This NPC just started
talking funny to me...
Yuuki
1640171_11_a
Yuuki
1640171_9_a
Little Red Riding Hood, may I ask
you to run an errand for me?
???
1640171_8_a
Leafa
1640171_10_a
You bet!
Yuuki
1640171_7_a
Hey, you're right! Hehe, let's
have lots of fun!
Leafa
1640171_6_a
Everyone split up to look for
stories, but it's pretty rare for
just the two of us to hang, huh?
Yuuki
1640171_5_a
Honestly, I don't think I have any
idea which way is right anymore.
Leafa
1640171_4_a
Hmm... Everywhere I look I see
trees.
Leafa
1640171_3_a
Leafa
1640171_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Leafa, is this the right way?
Yuuki
1640171_1_a
Sinon
1640168_62_a
Ha ha, I guess you're right.
Kirito
1640168_61_a
Silica
1640168_60_a
Hehe, it's all in how you phrase
things! And who better to convince
a woman than other women?
Leafa
1640168_59_a
Thanks for all your help, guys.
I never would've been able to
convince her on my own.
Kirito
1640168_58_a
Sinon
1640168_57_a
...
Kirito
1640168_56_a
Yuuki
1640168_55_a
Night!
Liz
1640168_54_a
Haha okay! Goodnight!
Asuna
1640168_53_a
Enough stalling! Log out and rest!
Yuuki
1640168_52_a
It feels so nice to be
Asuna
1640168_51_a
Thanks, guys. I know how much you
all care about me.
Asuna
1640168_50_a
Liz
1640168_49_a
Yuuki
1640168_48_a
Hehe, you got it!
Asuna
1640168_47_a
get some sleep and be back here
tomorrow in top form, or else!
Sinon
1640168_46_a
If you saw through all that, then
you should just log out now,
Sinon
1640168_45_a
Kirito
1640168_44_a
O-Oh. Well...
Sinon
1640168_43_a
Liz
1640168_42_a
Yuuki
1640168_41_a
Hehe, I didn't need to hear it
from him. I just know you're
sweet like that, Sinonon.
Asuna
1640168_40_a
I didn't say anything!
Kirito
1640168_39_a
Kirito
1640168_38_a
How much did you tell her,
Kirito?!
Sinon
1640168_37_a
Liz
1640168_36_a
Yuuki
1640168_35_a
And you were just phrasing it that
way because you knew I'd keep
insisting I was fine.
Asuna
1640168_34_a
Silica
1640168_33_a
Leafa
1640168_32_a
Well, I...!
Sinon
1640168_31_a
but you were really making sure
I wasn't straining my voice,
weren't you?
Asuna
1640168_30_a
Liz
1640168_29_a
Yuuki
1640168_28_a
You said you thought my singing
in this state would give us a
lower score,
Asuna
1640168_27_a
Silica
1640168_26_a
Leafa
1640168_25_a
For what?!
Sinon
1640168_24_a
Forgive me.
Asuna
1640168_23_a
Liz
1640168_22_a
Yuuki
1640168_21_a
Sinonon, I...
Asuna
1640168_20_a
Silica
1640168_19_a
Leafa
1640168_18_a
Yeah, so don't make me tell you
over and over that you shouldn't
feel responsible for anything.
Sinon
1640168_17_a
Actually, I think this was a
change for the better. I didn't
really notice any mistakes!
Kirito
1640168_16_a
Liz
1640168_15_a
Yuuki
1640168_14_a
All those last minute part changes
must've been really hard on you
guys...
Asuna
1640168_13_a
Yeah...
It was really great, but...
Asuna
1640168_12_a
That was the best show we've put
on lately! Right, Asuna?
Yuuki
1640168_9_a
Liz
1640168_11_a
Asuna
1640168_10_a
Whoa! That's a really good score!
Leafa
1640168_8_a
Let's see how we did...
Leafa
1640168_7_a
Sinon
1640168_6_a
Leafa
1640168_5_a
Thanks, Liz!
Silica
1640168_4_a
Yuuki
1640168_3_a
Asuna
1640168_2_a
bg_event_idol_stage_open_space
Great job, guys!
Liz
1640168_1_a
Yeah I do!
Kirito
1640167_24_a
Heh, you owe me one.
Sinon
1640167_23_a
Yeah, I'll do that. Thanks for the
talk, Sinon!
Kirito
1640167_22_a
You should check in on her.
Sinon
1640167_21_a
She's probably in a bit of shock,
since I phrased things so
bluntly.
Sinon
1640167_20_a
Now go talk to her already.
Sinon
1640167_19_a
Yeah, you're right...
Kirito
1640167_18_a
That kind of mentality is what
helped her be the leader everyone
needed in SAO.
Sinon
1640167_17_a
Don't get all mopey about it.
Sinon
1640167_16_a
It's no wonder she made a great
Vice Commander of the Knights of
the Blood Oath...
Kirito
1640167_15_a
You were smart to put it that
way, given her personality...
Kirito
1640167_14_a
Yeah. She worries way more about
being a burden to others than
she does about her own health.
Kirito
1640167_13_a
So I didn't think she'd agree
unless I explained myself.
Sinon
1640167_12_a
She can do anything she puts her
mind to, but she's got a bad habit
of going overboard.
Sinon
1640167_11_a
...
Sinon
1640167_10_a
But you put it that way in order
to convince her, didn't you?
Kirito
1640167_9_a
I just told it like it is.
Making her sing like this would
take away from the game.
Sinon
1640167_8_a
You convinced her not to sing as
much without coming out and saying
she sounds bad, didn't you?
Kirito
1640167_7_a
Huh?
Sinon
1640167_6_a
Thanks for handling the situation
with Asuna.
Kirito
1640167_5_a
Kirito
1640167_4_a
What's up, Kirito?
Sinon
1640167_3_a
Sinon
1640167_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Sinon.
Kirito
1640167_1_a
...
Kirito
1640165_49_a
Liz
1640165_48_a
Sinon
1640165_47_a
A-Absolutely!
Asuna
1640165_46_a
Just give us your best dancing
instead, and we'll call it even!
Sinon
1640165_45_a
O-Okay. I see your point.
Asuna
1640165_44_a
Well, the only way to keep that
from happening is to cut down on
your singing parts.
Sinon
1640165_43_a
Anyone who can't sing perfectly
takes away from the overall
experience of the game, right?
Sinon
1640165_42_a
I'm not just doing this for your
sake, Asuna.
Sinon
1640165_41_a
Liz
1640165_40_a
B-But...! 
sniff
Asuna
1640165_39_a
I think we should take another
look at the songs and divide
up some of your parts.
Sinon
1640165_38_a
Liz
1640165_37_a
What do you mean?
Asuna
1640165_36_a
But I don't think we should make
you sing all out today.
Sinon
1640165_35_a
Liz
1640165_34_a
Kirito
1640165_33_a
Hehe, thanks Sinonon!
Asuna
1640165_32_a
Leafa
1640165_31_a
Looks like I'm outnumbered...
Sinon
1640165_30_a
Liz
1640165_29_a
Kirito
1640165_28_a
Aww, thanks guys! 
sniff
Asuna
1640165_27_a
Yuuki
1640165_26_a
Me three! Just let us know when
you get tired, Asuna!
Silica
1640165_25_a
I'm with Asuna!
Leafa
1640165_24_a
Sinon
1640165_23_a
Me too. She's never led us astray
before!
Leafa
1640165_22_a
Asuna
1640165_21_a
but I'm gonna side with Asuna on
this one. If she says she's good
to go, I believe her.
Liz
1640165_20_a
Asuna
1640165_19_a
Look, I know we're all worried
about her for the same reasons,
Liz
1640165_18_a
Asuna, I don't think
Kirito
1640165_17_a
So don't sweat it! The game will
balance all of this out. 
sniff
It'll all be okay.
Asuna
1640165_16_a
Besides, this game melds your
real-life singing ability with
that of your in-game stats, right?
Asuna
1640165_15_a
Kirito
1640165_14_a
No way! 
sniff
I'll be able to sing, don't worry.
Asuna
1640165_13_a
Silica
1640165_12_a
Liz
1640165_11_a
Yeah, maybe you should at least
give yourself a break in-game...
Yuuki
1640165_10_a
Leafa
1640165_9_a
It's hard enough trying to sing
with a cold in real life,
isn't it?
Sinon
1640165_8_a
Kirito
1640165_7_a
Yep! I'm good to go. My voice may
not be at 100%, but I feel fine!
sniff
Asuna
1640165_6_a
Sinon
1640165_5_a
You still sound really congested.
Are you SURE you're okay?
Leafa
1640165_4_a
Um, Asuna...
Kirito
1640165_3_a
Kirito
1640165_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Okay guys, let's do this!
sniff
Asuna
1640165_1_a
She's definitely aiming high,
whether that exact thought is
bothering her or not.
Kirito
1640163_36_a
Leafa
1640163_35_a
So you think that's what's
bothering her?
Sinon
1640163_34_a
Being decent at everything is
useful, but no one skill stands
out.
Kirito
1640163_33_a
Sinon
1640163_32_a
Oh...
Leafa
1640163_31_a
I think she's still looking for
something that gives her a unique
advantage in this game.
Kirito
1640163_30_a
Liz
1640163_29_a
Silica
1640163_28_a
So she's more than capable in any
situation, with few weaknesses...
How is that not enough?
Yuuki
1640163_27_a
Yuuki
1640163_26_a
Silica
1640163_25_a
Makes sense. That's how Asuna was
in SAO and ALO.
Liz
1640163_24_a
I looked up more about the Diva
class. They're generally well-
balanced players with high stats.
Kirito
1640163_23_a
She's a Diva class player, right?
Kirito
1640163_22_a
Sinon
1640163_21_a
What do you mean?
Leafa
1640163_20_a
That might have caused her to put
pressure on herself.
Kirito
1640163_19_a
Sinon
1640163_18_a
She had the edge on us in dancing
and stamina, too. Why didn't she
just take it easy?
Leafa
1640163_17_a
Liz
1640163_16_a
Silica
1640163_15_a
You and me both, Silica.
Yuuki
1640163_14_a
Yeah, if anything, I should be
the one putting in extra time...
Silica
1640163_13_a
Why would she need to practice so
hard?
Yuuki
1640163_12_a
Weren't her singing stats already
pretty high, though?
Yuuki
1640163_11_a
Silica
1640163_9_a
Yeah, good point. Once again, her
competitive spirit comes back to
bite her in the butt.
Liz
1640163_8_a
Yuuki
1640163_10_a
That's worrying. She has been
staying up late to put more time
into this game, hasn't she...
Sinon
1640163_7_a
Sinon
1640163_6_a
You know, I did notice that she
was coughing a lot.
Leafa
1640163_5_a
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We don't know for sure that it's
a cold. She thinks it's allergies.
Kirito
1640163_4_a
Yuuki
1640163_3_a
Silica
1640163_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Say WHAT?!
Asuna's out with a cold?!
Liz
1640163_1_a
Okay.
Asuna
1640161_20_a
Yeah, I think that'd be best.
Get some sleep, okay?
Kirito
1640161_19_a
I know. Alright, I'll log out.
I don't want you worrying about
me all day.
Asuna
1640161_18_a
No, I'm not mad exactly...
I'm just...
Kirito
1640161_17_a
You're not mad, are you?
Asuna
1640161_16_a
...
Kirito
1640161_15_a
I don't want to fall behind.
Asuna
1640161_14_a
No, I can't. Liz and the others
are working hard to raise their
singing stats.
Asuna
1640161_13_a
You've practiced enough for
today. Why don't you log out and
get some rest?
Kirito
1640161_12_a
Yeah, but we have to take care of
ourselves while we do it.
Otherwise there's no show.
Kirito
1640161_11_a
We're just starting to figure out
this Pop Star Online game and
enjoy ourselves, too.
Asuna
1640161_10_a
Don't worry 
sniff
about me.
I'll keep giving it my all! I
don't want to let the group down!
Asuna
1640161_9_a
That, or a cold brought on by the
sudden change in the weather.
Kirito
1640161_8_a
It's probably just my allergies.
I mean, it is spring now.
Asuna
1640161_7_a
No, I'm okay...
Asuna
1640161_6_a
Eesh, you even sound congested.
Do you have a cold?
Kirito
1640161_5_a
Yeah... Yeah, I'll be fine.
sniff
Asuna
1640161_4_a
Asuna
1640161_3_a
Are you okay, Asuna?
Kirito

cough
Gugh...
Asuna
1640161_1_a
Thank you very much!
Silica
1640148_26_a
Still, you should take it, Silica.
You definitely earned it.
Klein
1640148_25_a
Ehehe, you caught me...
Klein
1640148_24_a
and guys can't equip the Kunoichi
anyway!
Furinkazan Member
1640148_23_a
Hahaha, Klein, you're only saying
that 'cause she's the only girl,
Furinkazan Member
1640148_22_a
The Kunoichi, you mean?
Silica
1640148_21_a
item_event_kunoichi_silica
Hey, you should totally have this
one, Silica! It'd be perfect for
you!
Klein
1640148_20_a
That's right!
Silica
1640148_19_a
This quest was a serious pain in
the butt, though the rewards are
supposed to be pretty sweet.
Klein
1640148_18_a
Thanks for your help. Both of you!
Klein
1640148_17_a
We did it!
Silica
1640148_16_a
Hah! Look, the quest complete
window just popped up!
Klein
1640148_15_a
You guys are awesome!
I knew you could do it!
Klein
1640148_14_a
We did it, Klein! We wiped out all
the enemies over here too!
Furinkazan Member
1640148_13_a
And I think everyone else
managed all right too!
Silica
1640148_12_a
Yes! I've already defeated all the
ninjas that tried to attack my
position!
Silica
1640148_9_a
Pina

You doing okay over there,

Chiiiirp!

1640148_6_a
Pina
1640148_5_a
Kleeeiiin!
Silica
1640148_4_a
I should see if anyone else needs
help...
Klein
1640148_3_a
I'm glad we figured out it can shut
on its own. That made it easy to
divide and conquer the mobs.
Klein
1640148_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle_inside
Wheeew... Now the back gate's
secured...
Klein

Chiiiirp!
Pina
1640147_18_a
Leave it to us!
Silica
1640147_17_a
Alright. Remember, use Pina's
attack to drown 'em from up there!
Klein
1640147_16_a
Okay, I'm going to head to my spot
up on the roof now!
Silica
1640147_15_a
Yeah!
Furinkazan Member
1640147_14_a
You are NOT allowed to die! We're
gonna win, and we're gonna finish
this quest!
Klein
1640147_13_a
I doubt we'll have enough time
to even send a message,
so I'll tell you this now!
Klein
1640147_12_a
Okay, guys, once this starts,
we're gonna be fighting on our own
at each of our stations.
Klein
1640147_11_a
You can say that again.
Klein
1640147_10_a
Hehe, it does! It's pretty amazing
VR lets you experience so many
different styles in one game.
Silica
1640147_9_a
Since you win by holding your
position for a set amount of
turns.
Klein
1640147_8_a
You know, this feels less like an
action game and more like an RTS
or a tower defense...
Klein
1640147_7_a
It's over if even one of us messes
up, but we have a better chance of
winning this way than last time.
Silica
1640147_6_a
We'll split up and each stand
guard at these chokepoints to
hold them back.
Silica
1640147_5_a
Aw yeah!
Furinkazan Member
1640147_4_a
Pina
1640147_3_a
Silica
1640147_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
Alright...
This is our new strategy!
Klein
1640147_1_a
Okay!
Silica
1640145_29_a
Yeah!
Furinkazan Member
1640145_28_a
Maybe we'll find a good place to
set an ambush, or there could be
traps already set up!
Klein
1640145_27_a
Alright, let's take another look
at the map of the castle.
Klein
1640145_26_a
Being built on top of a cliff, or
having a moat, or narrow paths
with lots of blind corners.
Klein
1640145_25_a
Like how?
Silica
1640145_24_a
They're impregnable because
they're built to be a nightmare
for attackers.
Klein
1640145_23_a
Yeah. Think about all those
impregnable fortresses you hear
about in old war stories.
Klein
1640145_22_a
Um... Do you mean figuring out
how best to defend the castle?
Silica
1640145_21_a
There must be some trick to
keeping them from attacking
the way they did...
Klein
1640145_20_a
Well, to be honest, there were
like a MILLION mobs, but they're
still just mobs, after all...
Klein
1640145_19_a
Y-Yeah...
Klein
1640145_18_a
So take a deep breath and calm
down. Then we can put our heads
together and figure this out.
Silica
1640145_17_a
But no one's blaming you for
failing the quest. If anything,
we're all alive thanks to you.
Silica
1640145_16_a
Klein, I understand what you're
going through right now.
Silica
1640145_15_a
sniff
...
Sorry, guys...
You're totally right...
Klein
1640145_14_a
We just have to figure out how to
beat this quest on our own!
Furinkazan Member
1640145_13_a
We've already registered our
party. It's too late to change any
of the members.
Furinkazan Member
1640145_12_a
Klein
1640145_11_a
Don't be so hard on yourself,
Klein!
Furinkazan Member
1640145_10_a
I wish K-dawg was here. He'd
know what to do...
Klein
1640145_9_a
Hrrrmm...
Klein
1640145_8_a
We could try again, but how are we
going to handle that many enemies?
Silica
1640145_7_a
At least none of us got killed.
I guess that's something...
Klein
1640145_6_a
Yeah... And we fail the quest as
soon as they take down the lord...
Klein
1640145_5_a
We were completely
outnumbered...
Silica
1640145_4_a
Pina
1640145_3_a
Silica
1640145_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
sigh
...
We lost...
Klein
1640145_1_a
Pina
1640143_25_a
Silica
1640143_24_a
Give it all you got, Pina!
Klein
1640143_23_a
Chirp!
Pina
1640143_22_a
Okay!
Silica
1640143_21_a
Alright, I'm going to the back
gate! Take care of the guys on
the roof for me!
Klein
1640143_20_a
Y-You're right...
Sorry I almost lost it, Silica!
Klein
1640143_19_a
but we have to do everything we
can! It might even give us an
advantage for next time!
Silica
1640143_18_a
W-We can't give up!
I know the situation looks bad,
Silica
1640143_17_a
No way do we stand a chance
against this many!
Klein
1640143_16_a
What the hell! There are way more
of 'em than we knew about!
Klein
1640143_15_a
Klein, they're on the roof!
Silica
1640143_14_a
What is it, Pina?
Why are you looking up
Aaaahh!
Silica
1640143_13_a
Klein
1640143_12_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
1640143_11_a
You serious?!
Klein
1640143_10_a
Klein! They're storming the
back gate too!
Furinkazan Member
1640143_9_a
B-But I have to try!
Silica
1640143_8_a
That's barely gonna slow 'em
down!
Klein
1640143_7_a
Chirp chiiiirp!
Pina
1640143_6_a
Pina, use your bubble attack!
Silica
1640143_5_a
Whoa! I didn't think there'd be
THIS many! Twenty, no, thirty,
FORTY?!
Klein
1640143_4_a
Pina
1640143_3_a
Klein
1640143_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle_inside
Th-There are so many of them!
Silica
1640143_1_a
Yeah! I know you got this!
Klein
1640141_14_a
Oh, okay. That makes sense...
Alright, I'll do my best!
Silica
1640141_13_a
Tamed monsters don't count toward
the limit, so I figured having you
here'd give us a leg up.
Klein
1640141_12_a
But you can only have so many
players in your party. Probably to
make it extra hard to win.
Klein
1640141_11_a
Well, 'cause you've got Pina.
According to the info we have,
there are a TON of ninjas.
Klein
1640141_10_a
Okay, got it. But why did you ask
me to help?
Silica
1640141_9_a
This clan of ninjas are after the
lord of the castle, so we gotta
keep them from killing him.
Klein
1640141_8_a
It's our job to protect the
castle this time.
Klein
1640141_7_a
Oh, it's no problem at all.
What do we have to do?
Silica
1640141_6_a
Thanks for helping Furinkazan out
with this quest, Silica.
Klein
1640141_5_a
Yep.
Klein
1640141_4_a
Pina
1640141_3_a
Klein
1640141_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
So this is the new area...
Look at that castle!
Silica
1640141_1_a
サクヤ、ホントにありがと
リーファ
1640128_30_a
ふふっ、そうか
サクヤ
1640128_29_a
あはは、それもいいけど……
ありがたくもらっておくよ
リーファ
1640128_28_a
リーファが要らないと言うのなら……
私が今ここで着てみてもいいんだ
こういうのも私は似合うはずだ
サクヤ
1640128_27_a
むっ、だが似合わないとは
言っていないぞ
サクヤ
1640128_26_a
ふふっ、そうだね……
なぁんだ……
自分で着る用じゃなかったんだ……
リーファ
1640128_25_a
ただプレゼントするためなのに
その相手に手伝わせるなんて……
という突っ込みは無しで頼むよ
サクヤ
1640128_24_a
ふふっ、ドッキリというやつだ
サクヤ
1640128_23_a
サ、サクヤ……!
リーファ
1640128_22_a
私は元々キミにプレゼントするため
このクエストに挑戦したんだよ
サクヤ
1640128_21_a
ふふっ、リーファが言っていただろ?
私が選ぶには意外なデザインだと
サクヤ
1640128_20_a
これってサクヤが自分のために
手に入れたかったんじゃないの?
リーファ
1640128_19_a
サクヤ
1640128_18_a
えっ!?
こ、これって今回の報酬の……
振袖の装備?
リーファ
1640128_17_a
item_event_kimono_leafa
そしてこれは……
日々守ってもらっているキミへの
感謝の証だ
サクヤ
1640128_16_a
サクヤ……
リーファ
1640128_15_a
同じ種族のキミとは常に肩を並べて
戦える存在でありたいのだ
サクヤ
1640128_14_a
確かに立場上守ってもらうことは
多いが、私もプレイヤーの一人
サクヤ
1640128_13_a
ふむ……リーファよ
なにか勘違いしているな
サクヤ
1640128_12_a
だからごめん……
リーファ
1640128_11_a
だからってサクヤを危険な目に
遭わせて許されるわけじゃないよ
リーファ
1640128_10_a
もう一組をハイディングさせて、
私を殺すつもりだったのだ
サクヤ
1640128_9_a
最初から計画していたんだろう
サクヤ
1640128_8_a
ん、気にするな
あいつらは偶然出会ったような
振りをしていたが、
サクヤ
1640128_7_a
サクヤ……ごめん
守るって言っておきながら、
あんなことになっちゃって……
リーファ
1640128_6_a
まさか二組で
徒党を組んでいたとは思わなかった
サクヤ
1640128_5_a
う、うん……
リーファ
1640128_4_a
奴らに襲われたときは
一瞬冷やっとしたが……
サクヤ
1640128_3_a
リーファ
1640128_2_a
bg_18_tower_road_sunset
ふぅ……
これで無事にクエストクリアだな
サクヤ
1640128_1_a
う、うん!!
リーファ
1640127_25_a
キミはそいつらを斬り刻んでやれ!
サクヤ
1640127_24_a
リーファ!
今のうちだ!
こちらの二人は私がなんとかする!
サクヤ
1640127_23_a
サクヤ!!
リーファ
1640127_22_a
ぐげぇえっ!!
ば、バカな!?
領主自らが……!?
サラマンダー
1640127_21_a
ヌンッ!!!
サクヤ
1640127_20_a
隙ありだ!!
死ねぇ!!
サラマンダー
1640127_19_a
なっ!?
もう一人、いや二人隠れて……!?
リーファ
1640127_18_a
なーんてな!
サラマンダー
1640127_17_a
後ろががら空きだよ!!
リーファ
1640127_16_a
こ、こいつすげぇ速い!!
サラマンダー
1640127_15_a
うぬっ!?
サラマンダー
1640127_14_a
遅い!!
リーファ
1640127_13_a
二対一じゃあどうにもならないトコ、
教えてやるぜぇ!!
サラマンダー
1640127_12_a
あいつはシルフ五傑の一人だろ?
実力には自信があるんだろうが……
サラマンダー
1640127_11_a
こいつは甘く見られたもんだぜ
独りで俺らを倒すってよ
サラマンダー
1640127_10_a
相手も二人だけだから大丈夫
あたしがなんとかしてみせる!
リーファ
1640127_9_a
しかし……!
サクヤ
1640127_8_a
サクヤは後ろに下がって!
リーファ
1640127_7_a
むっ……
こいつは厄介だな
サクヤ
1640127_6_a
……!
サラマンダーのプレイヤー!!
リーファ
1640127_5_a
シルフの領主じゃねーか!
サラマンダー
1640127_4_a
サクヤ
1640127_3_a
リーファ
1640127_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
おいおい!
あれを見ろよ!
サラマンダー
1640127_1_a
うん!
リーファ
1640125_15_a
ああ、では最後までよろしく頼むぞ
サクヤ
1640125_14_a
あはは、そっか
まあ頼りに思ってくれるのは
ありがたいよ
リーファ
1640125_13_a
うむ、だからこそリーファの
護衛を頼んだわけだよ
サクヤ
1640125_12_a
ゼロってわけじゃないよね
危険はやっぱりあるんじゃない?
リーファ
1640125_11_a
なるほど……お正月だもんね
でも確かにダイブする人は
少ないかもしれないけど、
リーファ
1640125_10_a
だからこの種族同士が
入り乱れるクエストでも
危険は少ないと考えたんだ
サクヤ
1640125_9_a
ん、そうだな……
レコンには話したが、ちょうど
今はプレイヤーが減少している
サクヤ
1640125_8_a
領主が殺されるわけには
いかないからね……
リーファ
1640125_7_a
いつも必要なクエストで
危険を伴う場合って、
誰かに依頼してたでしょ?
リーファ
1640125_6_a
というと……?
サクヤ
1640125_5_a
サクヤ、どうしてこのクエを
自分でプレイしてみる気になったの?
リーファ
1640125_4_a
ん、どうした?
サクヤ
1640125_3_a
サクヤ
1640125_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
それにしても……
リーファ
1640125_1_a
そうか、助かるぞ
サクヤ
1040093_66_a
うん、わかった……いいよ!
サクヤがそこまで言うのなら、
手伝ってあげる!
リーファ
1040093_65_a
私とて色んな種類の装備を
着こなしてみたくなるのさ
サクヤ
1040093_64_a
普段着てる着流し風の着物みたいに
もう少し艶っぽいのが好みなのかと
思ってたけど……
リーファ
1040093_63_a
ふーん、どれどれ……へぇ
サクヤこういうのが、欲しいんだ
リーファ
1040093_62_a
このクエストでも
入手できる振袖がある
そいつがかなり私好みでな……
サクヤ
1040093_61_a
今回、正月限定で振袖が
何種類か実装されているのだが、
サクヤ
1040093_60_a
でもサクヤどうして……?
このクエストでなにか
手に入れたい物でもあるの?
リーファ
1040093_59_a
はは、まあそういうレコンは
戦闘以外のところでは
十分助けられている
サクヤ
1040093_58_a
ええっ、酷いよ!
レコン
1040093_57_a
まあレコンだったら
確かに不安だけど……
リーファ
1040093_56_a
このクエストでコンビを組むなら、
相方は相当な実力者でないとな
サクヤ
1040093_55_a
うむ、知っている
だからこそリーファに
頼んでいるんだ
サクヤ
1640123_21_a
きっとクエスト中に種族同士で
バトルすることにもなるはず!
リーファ
1640123_20_a
しかもこれ、いろんな種族が
同時に参加できるやつだよ
リーファ
1640123_19_a
サクヤ
1640123_18_a
えっ……?
このクエってかなり大変なんじゃ……
リーファ
1640123_17_a
どれどれ……
二人パーティ専用のクエストか……
リーファ
1640123_16_a
そうか……
ならばこのクエの攻略を私と共に
請けてはくれないだろうか?
サクヤ
1640123_15_a
ああ、お正月限定のクエストを
できる限り攻略してくつもりだよ
リーファ
1640123_14_a
リアルではなくALOでの話だ
サクヤ
1640123_13_a
ん、お正月……?
お兄ちゃん達と初詣に行く
つもりだけど……
リーファ
1640123_12_a
そうか
リーファは
正月の予定はどうなっている?
サクヤ
1640123_11_a
ううん、大丈夫だよ
リーファ
1640123_10_a
リーファ、突然すまないな
サクヤ
1640123_9_a
ど、どっちでもって……
レコン
1640123_8_a
メッセにはサクヤが
呼んでるって書いてたじゃん
まあどっちでもいいけど
リーファ
1640123_7_a
ぼ、僕が呼んだんだから、
僕もいたっていいでしょ!?
レコン
1640123_6_a
なんだー、レコンもいたんだ
リーファ
1640123_5_a
リーファちゃん!
レコン
1640123_4_a
サクヤ
1640123_3_a
レコン
1640123_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
サクヤー、来たよー
リーファ
1640123_1_a
は、はあ……
レコン
1640121_17_a
それはリーファが来てから
一緒に答えるとしよう
サクヤ
1640121_16_a
えっ、リーファちゃんを!?
ええと、それは……その、
う、嬉しいですけどなんで……?
レコン
1640121_15_a
レコン、すまないが、
リーファを呼んでもらえるか?
サクヤ
1640121_14_a
……ええと、
それがどうかしたんですか?
レコン
1640121_13_a
そういうことだ
サクヤ
1640121_12_a
ああ……実家に帰ったりすると、
それでプレイできない環境に
なったりする人もいますからね
レコン
1640121_11_a
正月に限定して言えば、
ダイブする者が極端に増えたり、
プレイ時間が増えるとは限らないんだ
サクヤ
1640121_10_a
さすがのゲーマー達もリアルを
優先することが多いということさ
イベント盛り沢山だからと言って、
サクヤ
1640121_9_a
えっ?
それってなんですか……?
レコン
1640121_8_a
うむ、だが正月の場合、
他の連休とは明らかに異なる
特徴がある
サクヤ
1640121_7_a
ああ、なるほど
確かに長い休み中のオンゲって
イベントの数が増えますよね
レコン
1640121_6_a
ALOで行われるいくつかの
正月イベントスケジュールを
確認していたんだ
サクヤ
1640121_5_a
レコンか
いやなに……
サクヤ
1640121_4_a
サクヤさん、どうしたんですか?
レコン
1640121_3_a
レコン
1640121_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
ふむ……
なるほど
サクヤ
1640121_1_a
はい、ありがとうございます!
リーファさん!
1640118_18_a
じゃあ少し待っててね!
リーファ
1640118_17_a
……リーファさん
1640118_16_a
なに言ってるの
娘が寂しがってるのに、会うことを
嫌がる父親なんているわけないよ
リーファ
1640118_15_a
ええっ?
で、でもそれはご迷惑では……
1640118_14_a
ふふっ
じゃああたし今からログアウトして、
お兄ちゃん連れてくるよ
リーファ
1640118_13_a
常に一緒にいたい…です
1640118_12_a
でも……やはりマスターとなる
プレイヤーとは、
1640118_11_a
プライベート・ピクシーって、
確かある程度はマスターがいなくても
独自に動けるんだよね
リーファ
1640118_10_a
わたしはその後もストレアと
話をしていたんです
1640118_9_a
お二人とも用事があるということで、
先ほどログアウトされました
1640118_8_a
……そう言えば、
今日お兄ちゃん達と
一緒じゃなかったの?
リーファ
1640118_7_a
アタシもキリトに会いたくなったよ～
ストレア
1640118_6_a
なんだか急に
パパとママに会いたくなってきました
1640118_5_a
えへへ、キリストの家族とわたし達が
似てるって言われたからか、
1640118_4_a
リーファ
1640118_3_a
ストレア
1640118_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
………………
1640118_1_a
ユイちゃん……
リーファ
1640117_30_a
キリストに無償の愛を注ぐ
ヨハネやマリアと同じということ
なのかもしれませんね……
1640117_29_a
たとえ血が繋がっていなくても、
こうしてわたしを大事にしてくれる
パパとママは……
1640117_28_a
そうですね
1640117_27_a
……………
1640117_26_a
でもその子を必死に守る姿は……
確かにキリト達と重なって
見えるよね～
ストレア
1640117_25_a
ヨハネとキリストは血が繋がって
ないし、母マリアも神の子を懐胎
する者として選ばれただけだもんね～
ストレア
1640117_24_a
ううん
絵自体が似てるってわけじゃなくて、
境遇とか雰囲気とか、かな……?
リーファ
1640117_23_a
あの絵がわたし達に
似ていたんですか?
1640117_22_a
お兄ちゃんやアスナさん、
そしてユイちゃんと重なって
見えたんだよ
リーファ
1640117_21_a
キリストという子供と、その子を守り
旅をする父と母の姿が……
リーファ
1640117_20_a
えっ?
1640117_19_a
あっ、リーファもそう思ったんだね
あれがキリト達に似てるって
ストレア
1640117_18_a
はい……
それがどうかしたんですか?
1640117_17_a
あの最後のパネルあったでしょ?
エジプトからキリスト達が
帰っていく様子を描いてたやつ……
リーファ
1640117_16_a
なにがですか?
1640117_15_a
なんか似てるなって思って……
リーファ
1640117_14_a
リーファさん?
1640117_13_a
………………
リーファ
1640117_12_a
それに……
リーファ
1640117_11_a
あたしも改めてあのパネル展示を
見て、子供の頃知ったことを
思い出せて良かったよ
リーファ
1640117_10_a
そうだね～
ストレア
1640117_9_a
そうですよ
リーファさんのおかげで、
一つ勉強になりましたね、ストレア
1640117_8_a
クリスマスはイエス・キリストの
生誕をお祝いする日で、ただの冬の
お祭りじゃなかったんだね～
ストレア
1640117_7_a
なるほど～!
よくわかったよ～!

これがキリストが生誕した日、
クリスマスの始まりなんだよ
リーファ
1640117_5_a
王が死に
安全になったことを確認して、
祖国へと戻っていったんだよ
リーファ
1640117_4_a
1640117_3_a
ストレア
1640117_2_a

ヨハネとマリア、
そしてキリストの家族は、
リーファ
1640117_1_a
ほっ……
リーファ
1640115_23_a
うん、そうだね～
ストレア
1640115_22_a
わたし達も……
早くリーファさん達の気持ちが
わかるように、がんばりましょうね
1640115_21_a
まだまだ
わたし達に理解できないことも
多いんですよ
1640115_20_a
ストレア、人の感情というのは、
些細な機微で様々に変化します
1640115_19_a
ええっ?
リーファの言ってること、
全然わかんないよ～
ストレア
1640115_18_a
リーファさん……?
1640115_17_a
あっ、ええと……
も、もーっ、
これ以上は言わせないでー!
リーファ
1640115_16_a
リーファ?
なんで恥ずかしそうにしてるのー?
ストレア
1640115_15_a
う、うん
そうだよ……
リーファ
1640115_14_a
それはわたしも聞いたことがあります
マリアは処女懐胎……神の子を
身ごもったとされてるんですよね
1640115_13_a
あっ……ええと……
伝説上は違うみたい……
マリアは……その……
リーファ
1640115_12_a
ということはキリストのお父さん?
ストレア
1640115_11_a
この人はヨハネ
マリアの旦那様だよ
リーファ
1640115_10_a
このお方……マリアに寄り添う
男性はどなたなのでしょうか?
1640115_9_a
はい、そうみたいですね
わたしも安心しました……でも
1640115_8_a
良かった～!
これで王様に命を狙われる心配は
なくなったんだね～
ストレア
1640115_7_a
そこでマリアにこのことを伝えて、
王が死ぬまでエルサレムから逃げて
エジプトで暮らすように伝えたんだよ
リーファ
1640115_6_a
うん、そうだよ
博士は王の企みを神からのお告げで
予め知ってたんだって
リーファ
1640115_5_a
あっ、アタシ知ってる～
この場所きっとエジプトでしょ?
ストレア
1640115_4_a
リーファ
1640115_3_a
ストレア
1640115_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
このパネル……ここは砂漠ですね
マリアさんともう一人の男性、
そして赤ちゃんがいますね
1640115_1_a
それは次のパネルを見ればわかるよ
リーファ
1640113_29_a
ええーっ!?
どうなっちゃうのー!?
ストレア
1640113_28_a
そうだね……
リーファ
1640113_27_a
王様はキリストを殺そうとしたって
ことですか?
1640113_26_a
会ってみたいからって
嘘をついたんだよ……
リーファ
1640113_25_a
うん、王は博士たちに
キリストを見つけたら
自分にも知らせてほしい、
リーファ
1640113_24_a
王様はなにか企んだんですか……?
1640113_23_a
ほら、やっぱ悪い奴だー!
ストレア
1640113_22_a
でも王様がね、博士たちの話を聞いて
将来キリストが自分の地位を
脅かすんじゃないかって思ったんだよ
リーファ
1640113_21_a
博士はキリストの誕生の予言を聞き
この地にやってきて、まず王に
ベツレヘムの場所を聞いたの
リーファ
1640113_20_a
そうなんだ～
ストレア
1640113_19_a
ユイちゃんの方が正解だけど、
ストレアみたいに考える人も
いないわけじゃないみたいだね
リーファ
1640113_18_a
いえ、サンタクロースの起源は
確か四世紀ごろの聖ニコラスという
人物だったはずですが……
1640113_17_a
あれ……ってことは、
この博士たちが
サンタさんの起源とか?
ストレア
1640113_16_a
博士たちはキリスト……
つまり救世主の誕生を祝して
それぞれ贈り物をしたんだよ
リーファ
1640113_15_a
そうだよ
リーファ
1640113_14_a
へ～、じゃあこの女のひとが
キリスト様のお母さんなんだね～
ストレア
1640113_13_a
聖母マリアが
キリストを産もうとしてるんだよ
リーファ
1640113_12_a
そう、ここはベツレヘムにある
キリストの生家
リーファ
1640113_11_a
ここにも3人の博士がいるね
場所は……馬小屋?
ストレア
1640113_10_a
この先のパネルを見ればわかるよ
リーファ
1640113_9_a
えっ……それはどういう……
1640113_8_a
あはは、でもね
それは正しいかも
リーファ
1640113_7_a
ストレア、
そんなことを言っちゃいけませんよ!
1640113_6_a
なんだかこの王様、イジワルそう～
ストレア
1640113_5_a
なるほど、
これはわかりやすいですね
1640113_4_a
ストレア
1640113_3_a
1640113_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
これは当時の王様で、
王様に挨拶してる3人が
東方から来た3人の博士だね
リーファ
1640113_1_a
はい!
1640111_22_a
じゃあせっかくだし
あたしが案内するね
二人とも付いてきて
リーファ
1640111_21_a
うん、いいよ～
ストレア
1640111_20_a
それは確かに良さそうですね!
ストレア、それを見に行きましょう!
1640111_19_a
元々子供たちのために
作った展示みたいだけど、
それを見ればわかるんじゃないかな?
リーファ
1640111_18_a
この先にある図書館の展示スペースで
クリスマスの成り立ちみたいなのを
絵付きのパネルで展示してるよ
リーファ
1640111_17_a
なになにー?
ストレア
1640111_16_a
えっ?
1640111_15_a
あっ、クリスマスのことを
わかりやすく説明したいなら、
良いものがあるよ
リーファ
1640111_14_a
いえ、ですから……
1640111_13_a
だからクリスマスって
年末のお祭りなんでしょー?
ストレア
1640111_12_a
へぇ～、そうなんだ
リーファ
1640111_11_a
今ストレアに現実の文化の一つ、
クリスマスについて
教えていた所なんです
1640111_10_a
リーファ、こんにちは～
ストレア
1640111_9_a
リーファ
1640111_8_a
あっ、リーファさん
1640111_7_a
あれ、ユイちゃんにストレア
こんなところでどーしたの?
リーファ
1640111_6_a
ええと……それはそうなのですが……
1640111_5_a
クリスマスは
冬の楽しいお祭りなんだね!
ストレア
1640111_4_a
ふーん、飾りつけが豪華だし、
街もキラキラして
なんだか楽しいねー!
ストレア
1640111_3_a
ストレア
1640111_2_a
bg_event_alne_christmas
ストレア、
これをクリスマスというんですよ
1640111_1_a
ああ、そうだな
キリト
1640088_31_a
あはは、そうだね～!
でも……二人がうまく行って
ほんとに良かった……!
リーファ
1640088_30_a
あたし達、ずっと昔の恋人達の
愛のキューピットになったん
ですよね～!
シリカ
1640088_29_a
はわ～っ、
何だかロマンチックです!
シリカ
1640088_28_a
うん、そうだよ
晴れて結ばれた二人の子供として、
フレイヤさんが生まれるんだね……
リーファ
1640088_27_a
なるほど……
きっと世界樹の力が過去の人間と
スグ達を会わせてくれたんだな……
キリト
1640088_26_a
そうですね……
だからきっとあのスカジさんも……
幻じゃないんです
シリカ
1640088_25_a
だからこの装備はクエストの
成功報酬だったんだ……!
リーファ
1640088_24_a
あたし達の赤いアネモネって
アドバイスが、正解だったんだよ!
リーファ
1640088_23_a
うん、きっとスカジさんの告白が
成功したんだよ
リーファ
1640088_22_a
ということは……
キリト
1640088_21_a
「これは、時の迷い子となった女性の
愛の告白が成功したことの
お礼です」……って
リーファ
1640088_20_a
フレーバーテキストに書いてあったよ
リーファ
1640088_19_a
シリカちゃんと話してあたしが代表して
もらうってことになったんだけど……
リーファ
1640088_18_a
さっきね、突然インフォメーションが
表示されたんだ
この装備をゲットしたって
リーファ
1640088_17_a
お前、そんな装備持ってたか?
キリト
1640088_16_a
item_event_armor
ほら、見て、お兄ちゃん
この装備……
リーファ
1640088_15_a
スグ……?
キリト
1640088_14_a
ううん、幻じゃないよ
リーファ
1640088_13_a
じゃああたし達がスカジさんと
出会えたのは……
幻……?
シリカ
1640088_12_a
幻……
リーファ
1640088_11_a
ああ、それは世界樹が見て来た
歴史の一端をプレイヤーに幻として
見せる……ってことらしい
キリト
1640088_10_a
特別な力……ですか?
シリカ
1640088_9_a
地上の歴史を長年見てきた世界樹
だからこその特別な力が、
時折発現されるそうなんだ
キリト
1640088_8_a
やっぱり世界樹には
特殊な魔力があるらしくてな
キリト
1640088_7_a
ALOの世界や歴史を綴った書物を
片っ端から読んでたらな
世界樹についての記録があったんだ
キリト
1640088_6_a
どうしたの?
先に言っていいよ
リーファ
1640088_5_a
おおっ、スグにシリカ!
こっちも話があったんだ!
キリト
1640088_4_a
キリト
1640088_3_a
シリカ
1640088_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
おにーちゃん! おにーちゃん!
リーファ
1640088_1_a
そうだったんですね……
シリカ
1640087_19_a
諸説あるけど、
後にフレイ、フレイヤの父親になるって
言われてるんだ
リーファ
1640087_18_a
ニョルズっていうのは、
スカジの夫となるヴァン神族の一人だよ
リーファ
1640087_17_a
うん……
でもお兄ちゃんの予想は
当たってたみたい
リーファ
1640087_16_a
スカジさん……消えちゃいましたね
シリカ
1640087_15_a
うん……さようなら……
リーファ
1640087_14_a
ありがとう、それでは私はこれで……
スカジ
1640087_13_a
ニョルズ……さん
リーファ
1640087_12_a
それは……
ニョルズ様と言います
スカジ
1640087_11_a
私の愛する人の……名前ですか?
スカジ
1640087_10_a
最後にあなたの愛する人の名前を
教えてもらってもいいですか?
リーファ
1640087_9_a
あ、スカジさん
リーファ
1640087_8_a
ありがとうございます
ではその花をここから探して、
あの人に渡しますね……
スカジ
1640087_7_a
あなたを愛しています、
という意味があるんです
シリカ
1640087_6_a
それは……
赤いアネモネ
シリカ
1640087_5_a
スカジさん
あなたが愛を伝えるのにふさわしい
花言葉を見つけたよ
リーファ
1640087_4_a
シリカ
1640087_3_a
リーファ
1640087_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
あなた達……
スカジ
1640087_1_a
うん、わかったよ
リーファ
1640085_35_a
俺はもう少し世界樹について探ってみる
キリト
1640085_34_a
スグ達は引き続き彼女に
アドバイスできるような、
花言葉を探しておいてくれ
キリト
1640085_33_a
でもこれからどうすれば
いいんでしょう?
シリカ
1640085_32_a
確かに、その観点からも合点は行くな
キリト
1640085_31_a
NPCの重要キャラって点でも一緒だし
やっぱり親子ってことなのかもね……
リーファ
1640085_30_a
ああ、よくよく考えれば、
スカジさんもフレイヤさんも、
高い知能のAIを持ってたよね
リーファ
1640085_29_a
そうですね……
シリカ
1640085_28_a
た、確かにあれだけ大きな樹の苗木
なんだから、超常的な力を持ってても
おかしくないかもね
リーファ
1640085_27_a
それは……わからない……
でも俺はその鍵が世界樹の苗木に
関連してるんじゃないかって思ってる
キリト
1640085_26_a
は、はい……
でもどうしてそんな現象が
発生してしまったんでしょう……?
シリカ
1640085_25_a
シリカの話だとあの周辺は、
昔も花畑があったんだろ?
キリト
1640085_24_a
ああ、花園も今ある花園じゃなくて、
昔のあの場所のことを言ってたのかも
しれない
キリト
1640085_23_a
つ、つまりさっき出会ったスカジさんは
フレイヤさんが生まれる前の姿って
こと!?
リーファ
1640085_22_a
時間遡行!?
シリカ
1640085_21_a
いやいや、
この場合考えられるのは……
時間遡行イベントだろ?
キリト
1640085_20_a
ま、まさか浮気!?
リーファ
1640085_19_a
あれ?
既にフレイヤさんがいるのに、
そのお母さんが、想いを寄せる人……?
シリカ
1640085_18_a
フレイヤさんって、
前のヨツンヘイムのクエストで、
救ってあげた女神様ですよね……?
シリカ
1640085_17_a
あっ、確かスカジって……
北欧神話の……フレイヤさんの
お母さん!?
リーファ
1640085_16_a
スカジ……スカジ……
リーファ
1640085_15_a
それにスカジって名前……
スグ、何か思い浮かばないか?
キリト
1640085_14_a
あの花園ができたのは
最近のことなのに……
シリカ
1640085_13_a
そ、そう言えば……
でも変ですよね、昔からだなんて
シリカ
1640085_12_a
えっ!?
あっ……!
リーファ
1640085_11_a
昔から色々な花が咲き誇る
この花園って……
キリト
1640085_10_a
あのスカジって人が言った言葉だよ
あの人はこう言ったんだぜ
キリト
1640085_9_a
えっ……何がですか……
キリトさん?
シリカ
1640085_8_a
その前にお前達は気にならないのか?
キリト
1640085_7_a
もーっ、
お兄ちゃんさっきからどうしたの?
お兄ちゃんも花言葉調べてよ
リーファ
1640085_6_a
おい、スグ、シリカ
キリト
1640085_5_a
調べてみると、
色々な意味合いがあるんですね!
シリカ
1640085_4_a
キリト
1640085_3_a
シリカ
1640085_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
花言葉……花言葉……と
リーファ
1640085_1_a
お、おい……二人とも……!
キリト
1640083_25_a
うん、そうしよー!
リーファ
1640083_24_a
それを調べてスカジさんに
教えてあげましょう!
シリカ
1640083_23_a
花言葉……そうですね!
愛の告白にふさわしい花言葉って、
沢山ありますし!
シリカ
1640083_22_a
あっ、そうだ!
花言葉を調べてみようよ、シリカ!
リーファ
1640083_21_a
ふさわしい花ですか……!
そうですね、何がいいでしょう……?
シリカ
1640083_20_a
い、いや、そうじゃなくて……
キリト
1640083_19_a
お兄ちゃん、ボーっとしてないで!
スカジさんの相談に乗らなきゃ!
リーファ
1640083_18_a
………………
キリト
1640083_17_a
どの花がいいか、
相談に乗ってくれませんか……?
スカジ
1640083_16_a
愛を伝えるのにふさわしい花を
摘もうと考えています……
スカジ
1640083_15_a
せっかくなので昔から色々な花が
咲き乱れるこの花園で、
スカジ
1640083_14_a
あ、ああ
スマン……おい二人とも
スカジの話を最後まで聞くぞ
キリト
1640083_13_a
話を続けていいですか……?
スカジ
1640083_12_a
な、何ぃ!?
キリト
1640083_11_a
お兄ちゃんは女心がわかってないなー
そのうちアスナさんに
愛想つかされちゃうかもよ
リーファ
1640083_10_a
そ、そうなのか……?
キリト
1640083_9_a
だって恋の相談ですよ!
告白するためにお花を用意するだなんて
すごくドキドキするじゃないですか!
シリカ
1640083_8_a
お、おいシリカ……
どうしたんだ?
キリト
1640083_7_a
きゃーきゃー!
シリカ
1640083_6_a
その方に想いを伝えるために、
花を摘もうと思っているのですが……
スカジ
1640083_5_a
わっ!
きゃーっ!
シリカ
1640083_4_a
キリト
1640083_3_a
シリカ
1640083_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
実は私……
想いを寄せてる殿方が……
スカジ
1640083_1_a
はい、お話を聞いてもらえますか?
スカジ
1640081_26_a
スカジ……さん?
リーファ
1640081_25_a
は、はい
ありがとうございます
私の名前は……スカジと言います
???
1640081_24_a
あたしはリーファ
もし何か困ってるなら
なんでも話してみてよ
リーファ
1640081_23_a
ねえ、どうかしたの?
リーファ
1640081_22_a
………………
???
1640081_21_a
はい、
何かクエスト発生したんですかね?
シリカ
1640081_20_a
NPCみたいだな……
何か突然現れたけど……
キリト
1640081_19_a
そうですか……
???
1640081_18_a
いやぁ……今日初めてだけど……
リーファ
1640081_17_a
あなた達もここへよく来るんですか?
???
1640081_16_a
わっ!
リーファ
1640081_15_a
あの……
???
1640081_14_a
そうなのか……
キリト
1640081_13_a
えへへ……
シリカ
1640081_12_a
あっ……って言ってももちろん、
ALOとしての世界観設定の話
なんですけど
シリカ
1640081_11_a
何百年も……?
キリト
1640081_10_a
でもずっと昔……
何百年の前にも、この辺りは
花畑だったとも言われています
シリカ
1640081_9_a
そうか
まあケットシーの領地がこんな風に
綺麗に生まれ変わったんなら、何よりだ
キリト
1640081_8_a
詳しくはわかりませんけど、
世界樹の苗木が地中から復活したことが
原因なんじゃないかって言われてます
シリカ
1640081_7_a
へぇ～、なんでだろうね?
リーファ
1640081_6_a
ここは先日、巨人と戦った場所です
あのクエスト達成の数日後に
突然こんな風に変化したみたいですよ
シリカ
1640081_5_a
まさに咲き誇るって表現が
似合いそうな……
そんな風景だな
キリト
1640081_4_a
シリカ
1640081_3_a
キリト
1640081_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
わぁ、ほんとだ!
一面が花畑になってる!
リーファ
1640081_1_a
ええ、これもみんなが
付き合ってくれたおかげよ!
スパシーバ!
セブン
1640078_32_a
真実は探求できなかったけど、
面白い報酬もらえて良かったね
セブン
レイン
1640078_31_a
なるほど……確かにそうかもね
そう考えるとあの島に行っておいて
良かったわ～
セブン
1640078_30_a
あの島で
試すつもりだったのかもな……
キリト
1640078_29_a
もしかしたらこの宝箱を開けたら
能力を習得できるって仕様も、
キリト
1640078_28_a
そうだ
もうあの島は無くなったが、
キリト
1640078_27_a
ああ、前にお兄ちゃん達と
行った場所よね
リーファ
1640078_26_a
浦島太郎関連の本を何冊か読めば
発動するってフラグでな
キリト
1640078_25_a
あれで興味を持ってくれた
プレイヤーを対象にした
クエストだったんだろう
キリト
1640078_24_a
前に行った浦島太郎の伝説を
モチーフにした新エリア
キリト
1640078_23_a
恐らくだが……
これはALOの
新仕様なんだ……
キリト
1640078_22_a
しかもなんで日本の古文書に
そんな新しい仕様の報酬の
地図が隠されてたんだろう……?
レイン
1640078_21_a
ふふっ、セブン良かったね
でも宝箱開けたら能力開花するなんて
なんか変わった仕様だね
レイン
1640078_20_a
すごい……
面白いじゃない、この力!
セブン
1640078_19_a
へぇ……こんな報酬もあったんだね
リーファ
1640078_18_a
やっぱりだ
宝箱に入ってた水は対象者のスキルを
強化するものだったんだ
キリト
1640078_17_a
セブンの歌に反応して、
周囲に水が集まって……
形を形成していく……!?
レイン
1640078_16_a
わっ!
リーファ
1640078_15_a
ラララ～……
セブン
1640078_14_a
わ、わかったよ……
じゃあええと……
セブン
1640078_13_a
ああ、それでも構わない
キリト
1640078_12_a
スキル……?
あたしプーカだから歌関連の
バフ系スキルしかないよ
セブン
1640078_11_a
セブン、なにかスキルを
使ってみてくれるか?
キリト
1640078_10_a
きっと開いたプレイヤーに
所有権が移ってるはず……
キリト
1640078_9_a
そ、それってどういう……?
セブン
1640078_8_a
恐らくこの中に入ってた水自体が
宝箱の中身だったんだ
キリト
1640078_7_a
あっ……水が無くなってる
どうして……?
レイン
1640078_6_a
みんな、もう一度
箱の中身を見てくれ
キリト
1640078_5_a
お兄ちゃん、どういうこと?
リーファ
1640078_4_a
レイン
1640078_3_a
セブン
1640078_2_a
bg_event_swamp
……いや、空振りかどうかは、
まだわからないぞ
キリト
1640078_1_a
………………
キリト
1640077_17_a
もーっ、なんなのよ!
せっかくずぶ濡れになってここまで
来たのに、空振りだなんてイヤー!
セブン
1640077_16_a
箱の中も水が浸かってるね……
でも開けられた形跡もないし、
どういうことだろう……?
リーファ
1640077_15_a
えっ……?
なにも……ない?
セブン
1640077_14_a
うん!
セブン
1640077_13_a
開けてみようぜ!
キリト
1640077_12_a
あっ、ホントだ!
沼に沈んで半分見えないけど、
あれはトレジャーボックスだよ!
レイン
1640077_11_a
見てみんな!
あそこに水に浸かった箱が!
セブン
1640077_10_a
はは、違いないな
キリト
1640077_9_a
それに上からも下からも……
まさに濡れネズミ……
できれば長居したくない場所だよね
リーファ
1640077_8_a
そうなのか……
確かにめぼしいものは
あんまり無さそうだな
キリト
1640077_7_a
プレイヤーもあんまり訪れないって
聞いてるけど……
リーファ
1640077_6_a
モンスターもあんまりPOPしないし
素材もレアリティ低いものしか
落ちてないから、
リーファ
1640077_5_a
この辺一帯は
ずっと沼地が続いてるんだよ
リーファ
1640077_4_a
リーファ
1640077_3_a
セブン
1640077_2_a
bg_event_swamp
地図によるとこの辺だね……
レイン
1640077_1_a
ぐぬぬ……
キリト
1640075_24_a
お兄ちゃん、さすがに
こんな時くらいは空気読んでね
リーファ
1640075_23_a
スグ……お前なあ
キリト
1640075_22_a
ふふっ、じゃああたしも行くからね!
リーファ
1640075_21_a
うん、全然平気!
この知的探求心を満たせるなら
なんでもないわ!
セブン
1640075_20_a
この雨だとずぶ濡れに
なっちまうけど、いいのか?
キリト
1640075_19_a
でも興味はあるでしょ?
今からみんなで行ってみましょう!
セブン
1640075_18_a
いやさすがに仮想世界で
現実の歴史にかかわる発見は
ないでしょ!
レイン
1640075_17_a
ひょっとしたら浦島太郎伝説を
裏付ける有力な証拠かもしれない!
セブン
1640075_16_a
行ってみましょう!
この印の場所になにが隠されてるのか
知りたいわ!
セブン
1640075_15_a
うん、アルンの近くだよ
こっからなら飛んで数分だね
リーファ
1640075_14_a
この場所ってどの辺かわかる?
レイン
1640075_13_a
これは……
キリト
1640075_12_a
なんで図書館の古文書に
こんなものが紛れてるの?
セブン
1640075_11_a
地図……
しかも印がついてるってことは……
宝の地図?
リーファ
1640075_10_a
えっ、なにこれ……!?
セブン
1640075_9_a
そうね……
セブン
1640075_8_a
セブン、いいから見てみなよ
レイン
1640075_7_a
さっきまでこんなの
無かったような……
セブン
1640075_6_a
このページだけ違う紙みたい
セブン
1640075_5_a
なんか古文書の1ページが
光ってるな……
キリト
1640075_4_a
レイン
1640075_3_a
キリト
1640075_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
ん、なにかしらこれ……?
セブン
1640075_1_a
ううっ……
リーファ
1640073_38_a
爪の垢を煎じて飲ませてやりたいぜ
キリト
1640073_37_a
すごいな
どこかの妹とは大違いだ
キリト
1640073_36_a
止めろと言われても、
止めることはできないのよ～!
セブン
1640073_35_a
科学者にとって好奇心とは、
源泉から無限にあふれ出る
水のようなもの!
セブン
1640073_34_a
ふっふーん
セブン
1640073_33_a
あんたの専門分野じゃないのに、
よくもまあそれだけ熱を入れて、
調べられるよね
レイン
1640073_32_a
まあだからこそ、
歴史学者にとってロマンを感じる
ところなんだろうけどね～
セブン
1640073_31_a
諸説あるもんね
リーファ
1640073_30_a
そうだね
確か邪馬台国も
九州説とか近畿説とか、
リーファ
1640073_29_a
はは、日本神話の考証って
結構難儀らしいな
キリト
1640073_28_a
もうなにがなんやら……
セブン
1640073_27_a
うん、でも類推する神話が
幾つもあるし、いろんな地方に
伝説が残ってるし……
セブン
1640073_26_a
セブンは浦島太郎伝説について
調べてるんだよな
キリト
1640073_25_a
あっ、キリト君にリーファちゃん
来てたのね
セブン
1640073_24_a
リーファ
1640073_23_a
セブン
1640073_22_a
セブン、解読は進んでるか?
キリト
1640073_21_a
これじゃどれが
本物なのかわかんないじゃない……
セブン
1640073_20_a
なによこれぇ……
浦島太郎伝説って日本の
色んな場所に残ってるの……?
セブン
1640073_19_a
リーファ
1640073_18_a
キリト
1640073_17_a
あはは……
もっと本格的に調べたいらしいよ
レイン
1640073_16_a
浦島太郎なら難しいのじゃなくて
子供用の絵本があるんじゃない?
リーファ
1640073_15_a
レイン
1640073_14_a
この前のクエスト……
昔話ってことは……
浦島太郎でも読んでるのか?
キリト
1640073_13_a
ふふっ、この前のクエストで、
あの子、日本の昔話とかに
興味が湧いたみたいでね
レイン
1640073_12_a
なんで同じ日本語なのに、
あんなに違うんだろ……
リーファ
1640073_11_a
ああ、古文……
文法覚えるのが大変だよねぇ
リーファ
1640073_10_a
日本の古文書だよ
さすがの天才セブンも日本の古文は、
範疇外だったみたい
レイン
1640073_9_a
セブンは頭抱えて
なにを読んでるんだ?
キリト
1640073_8_a
だから仕方がないから、
この図書館に来て本でも読もうって
ことになったんだけど……
レイン
1640073_7_a
キリト
1640073_6_a
外はあいにくの雨でしょ?
レイン
1640073_5_a
今日たまたま二人でダイブできるから
どこかに出かけようって
話してたんだけど
レイン
1640073_4_a
リーファ
1640073_3_a
レイン
1640073_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
セブンはどうしたんだ?
キリト
1640073_1_a
うーん、うーん……
なんなのよ、これぇ……
セブン
1640071_20_a
レイン
1640071_19_a
リーファ
1640071_18_a
ん、あそこにいるのは……
セブンか?
キリト
1640071_17_a
実はね……
ほら、あれを見てくれる?
レイン
1640071_16_a
おっ、レインじゃないか
どうしたんだ、こんな場所で……
キリト
1640071_15_a
リーファ
1640071_14_a
キリト
1640071_13_a
プリヴィエート
キリト君、リーファちゃん
レイン
1640071_12_a
はぁ……
キリト
1640071_11_a
理屈っぽくて正論ばっかでさ～
リーファ
1640071_10_a
えっ?
キリト
1640071_9_a
うーっ……
お兄ちゃんウチの学校の
歴史の先生みたい
リーファ
1640071_8_a
わざわざここまで来たんだぞ
ちゃんと真面目にやれよ?
キリト
1640071_7_a
今日はお前が宿題教えてほしいって
言ってきて、始めたと思いきや
現実だとはかどらないって言うから、
キリト
1640071_6_a
えっ?
あーっ、えーと……
し、シテマセンよ?
リーファ
1640071_5_a
おいスグ……白々しいな
お前、今から漫画を読もうと
してないだろうな?
キリト
1640071_4_a
あそこにコミックがあるよ!
わーっ、VRMMO内の
図書館なのにすごいね!
リーファ
1640071_3_a
キリト
1640071_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
お兄ちゃんお兄ちゃん!
見てみて!
リーファ
1640071_1_a
うん!
それじゃあクエストに戻ろうか!
アスナ
1640068_33_a
はい!
かたきのモンスターも倒せましたし!
シリカ
1640068_32_a
そうね～
全員が話が通じない相手じゃ
ないってことがわかったしね
1640068_31_a
でもわたし……
サラマンダーのことが
少し理解できて良かったよ
アスナ
1640068_30_a
ああ、行っちゃった……
1640068_29_a
……戯れはこれまでだ
オレはもう行く
ユージーン
1640068_28_a
うふふっ、
照れくさいんじゃないですかね?
シリカ
1640068_27_a
ふふっ、
わかってもらえて嬉しいって
正直に言えばいいのに
1640068_26_a
ユージーン将軍……
アスナ
1640068_25_a
その目論見も
あながち外れというわけでも
なかったということだな……
ユージーン
1640068_24_a
イメージ向上も兼ねているのではと
思っていたが……
ユージーン
1640068_23_a
領主モーティマーと話していたが、
このキャンペーンは
運営の我らが種族に対する
ユージーン
1640068_22_a
単純に横暴な者もいるが……
そう受け取ってもらえるなら助かる
ユージーン
1640068_21_a
………………
ユージーン
1640068_20_a
好戦的なのはその結果……
って感じですよね?
アスナ
1640068_19_a
うん……でも今回わかりました
皆さんはただ好戦的なんじゃなくて、
仲間想いで絆が深いんだって
アスナ
1640068_18_a
アスナあんた……
それでキャンペーンに応募したのね?
1640068_17_a
どうしてそういう人が多いのか、
この機会に知ってみたくなったんです
アスナ
1640068_16_a
だからALOのサラマンダーの
プレイヤーさん達が好戦的って
いうイメージがあったから、
アスナ
1640068_15_a
わたし……元々PvPって
そんなに好きじゃないんです
アスナ
1640068_14_a
んもうっ!
せっかく手伝ってあげたんだし、
そんな事言わなくてもいいじゃない!
1640068_13_a
興味本位でここに来ただけなら、
ここまで危険な橋には
飛び込まないのが賢明な選択だろう
ユージーン
1640068_12_a
サラマンダー・キャンペーンの事は
知っている……
ユージーン
1640068_11_a
それは……
アスナ
1640068_10_a
しかしやはり解せぬ……
なぜここまで苦しい戦いに
お前たちは協力する気になったのだ?
ユージーン
1640068_9_a
は、はい!
アスナ
1640068_8_a
特にお前の回復魔法には
幾度となく助けられたぞ……
ユージーン
1640068_7_a
お前たちがいなければ
勝利は厳しかった
ユージーン
1640068_6_a
はい、倒しましたね!
アスナ
1640068_5_a
やったか……
ユージーン
1640068_4_a
アスナ
1640068_3_a
ユージーン
1640068_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave_boss
グガガガガッ……!
モンスター
1640068_1_a
ふふっ、それじゃあ行きましょう
アスナ
1640067_38_a
あっ、し、失礼しましたぁ!
シリカ
1640067_37_a
いや別に殺されてはいないが……
ユージーン
1640067_36_a
はい!
サラマンダーさん達の
弔い合戦ってやつですよね!
シリカ
1640067_35_a
はいはい、わかってるわよ
ここまでの状況見て放っておけるほど
あたしもクールじゃないわよ
1640067_34_a
リズとシリカちゃんも
お願いできるかな?
アスナ
1640067_33_a
アスナ……
1640067_32_a
はい、わたしはそれでも構いません
参加したいんです
アスナ
1640067_31_a
確かにこの先のモンスターって、
このクエストだと関係ないわよね
素通りすればそれで済むわけで……
1640067_30_a
いいのか……?
勝てる見込みは少ない上、報酬もない
それでも付き合うと……?
ユージーン
1640067_29_a
一時的なものですけど、あなたたちの
仲間と言える存在だと思います……
参加しちゃ……ダメですか?
アスナ
1640067_28_a
はい、今わたしはサラマンダーの
装備と能力を持ってます
だから、このクエも参加できたんです
アスナ
1640067_27_a
む……お前の姿……まさか?
ユージーン
1640067_26_a
お前たちには関係ない……
ユージーン
1640067_25_a
これは危険な戦いだ
それに傷ついた仲間たちの
かたき討ちでもある
ユージーン
1640067_24_a
ア、アスナ!?
1640067_23_a
それ、わたし達も
加わっていいですか?
アスナ
1640067_22_a
………………
アスナ
1640067_21_a
言わずとも、な
ユージーン
1640067_20_a
あっ、もしかして
この先にいるモンスターを
倒すために来たんですか?
シリカ
1640067_19_a
仲間を傷つけた者は許さぬ
必ず鉄槌を下すということだ……
ユージーン
1640067_18_a
ああ、そしてもう一つ
サラマンダーには鉄則がある……
ユージーン
1640067_17_a
なるほど……
誇り高き民族ってことかしら?
1640067_16_a
そして、だからこそ
一族を裏切った者もまた……
容赦はしない
ユージーン
1640067_15_a
同族が傷ついたときも、
こうして助け合う心を忘れない
ユージーン
1640067_14_a
あ、あなたは……
ユージーン将軍!
アスナ
1640067_13_a
我らは一族の絆は最も強い
ユージーン
1640067_12_a
えっ?
アスナ
1640067_11_a
そうだ
ユージーン
1640067_10_a
うん、サラマンダーの人たちって
同じ種族同士の繋がりが
深いのかもしれないね……
アスナ
1640067_9_a
あっ、ああ……なるほど
別パーティなら気にせずに
先に進んじゃう人もいますからね
シリカ
1640067_8_a
こうして傷ついた仲間を
みんなで救護してる様子を見て、
そう思ったのよ
1640067_7_a
サラマンダーってちょっと……
好戦的で野蛮なイメージがあったから
1640067_6_a
えっ、なにがですか?
シリカ
1640067_5_a
うん、わたしも……
アスナ
1640067_4_a
シリカ
1640067_3_a
アスナ
1640067_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
しかしちょっと意外だったわ……
1640067_1_a
はい!
回復魔法なら任せてください!
アスナ
1640065_31_a
あ、ああ
頼むよ……
サラマンダー（女性）
1640065_30_a
なにがあったのか教えてもらう前に
まずこの人たちの手当て、
手伝いますね
アスナ
1640065_29_a
この先は相当危険らしいよ
悪いことは言わないから、
行くのは止めておいた方がいい
サラマンダー（女性）
1640065_28_a
さっきのお姉さん……
シリカ
1640065_27_a
あ、アンタら……
サラマンダー（女性）
1640065_26_a
ペイン・アブソーバーがあるALOで
あれだけ痛がるなんて、
相当手ひどくやられたみたいね
1640065_25_a
皆さん、敵にやられたみたいですね
シリカ
1640065_24_a
くっそ……
あんなの勝てるわけねぇだろ……
サラマンダー
1640065_23_a
痛てぇ……
サラマンダー
1640065_22_a
さっき扉の前に
集まってた人たちもいる……
なにがあったのかしら?
1640065_21_a
えっ……ほ、ホントだ!
アスナ
1640065_20_a
あそこでサラマンダーの
プレイヤーさん達が
たくさん倒れてますよ!
シリカ
1640065_19_a
ん……あれ?
アスナさん、リズさん!
あそこを見てください!
シリカ
1640065_18_a
あっ、ううん
なんでもないよ
アスナ
1640065_17_a
ん、アスナ
どうかしたの?
1640065_16_a
うん……
そうだね……
アスナ
1640065_15_a
そういえばそうですね!
シリカ
1640065_14_a
思えばクラインもそんな感じよね
「オレはよぉ」とか威勢が良いわりに
基本は良識人だし
1640065_13_a
ふふっ、確かに
アスナ
1640065_12_a
途中からはみんな
気の良さそうな人なんだなって
思えてきましたし
シリカ
1640065_11_a
そ、そうでしたね
最初はサラマンダーの人たちばかりで
ちょっと怖かったですけど、
シリカ
1640065_10_a
オラついてるけど、
景気良さげで爽快というか……
あはは……
1640065_9_a
お祭りで大勢の男の人が
神輿でも担いでる感じだったわよね
1640065_8_a
なんかさぁ、
大勢のサラマンダーで揃って
掛け声上げながら扉を叩いてるとき、
1640065_7_a
まああんまり見たことない
光景ではあったけど……
アスナ
1640065_6_a
攻略の手順としては
正攻法じゃなくても……
決して間違いってわけじゃないからね
アスナ
1640065_5_a
そ、そうね
まさか物理と魔法攻撃で
扉を破壊して先に進むなんてね……
1640065_4_a
アスナ
1640065_3_a
1640065_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
あはは……さっきは
ちょっとビックリしちゃいましたね
シリカ
1640065_1_a
は、はい……
アスナ
1640063_29_a
あと少しで壊せそうだから、
3人とも手を貸しておくれ!
サラマンダー（女性）
1640063_28_a
さあさ、今あっちで
大勢で取り掛かってるとこなんだ!
サラマンダー（女性）
1640063_27_a
た、確かにそうかもしれないけど……
1640063_26_a
手っ取り早く済ませられるなら、
そっちの方がいいじゃないか!
サラマンダー（女性）
1640063_25_a
このダンジョンのどっかに
あるはずだけど、
イチイチ探すのめんどいでしょ?
サラマンダー（女性）
1640063_24_a
えっ?
扉なら……鍵はないんですか?
アスナ
1640063_23_a
破壊可能なオブジェクトだから、
一緒に手伝ってくれないか?
サラマンダー（女性）
1640063_22_a
この先に進むための扉を
ぶち壊したいんだよ!
サラマンダー（女性）
1640063_21_a
サラマンダーの
女性プレイヤーさん……
どうしたんでしょう?
シリカ
1640063_20_a
おっ、アンタら!
ちょっと手伝ってくれないかい!
サラマンダー（女性）
1640063_19_a
も～っ、勘弁して～!
アスナ
1640063_18_a
サラマンダーの特性が加わると、
ますますその二つ名が
広まりそうねぇ……
1640063_17_a
ああ……アスナさんの悪名……
シリカ
1640063_16_a
う、ううっ……
《バーサクヒーラー》……
思い出しちゃった……
アスナ
1640063_15_a
あはは……
アスナさんには前衛を任せちゃって
いいってことですね……
シリカ
1640063_14_a
了解ー
じゃあこの3人での立ち回りは
基本おんなじでOKってことね
1640063_13_a
あっ、でもこれまでのわたしの
ステータスも残ってるから
回復魔法もまだ使えるよ
アスナ
1640063_12_a
筋力値が高いとか、
攻撃系のスキルの熟練度が
上がってるとか、かな
アスナ
1640063_11_a
どうなってるんですか?
シリカ
1640063_10_a
でもステータス的なものは、
ちゃんと補正されてるんだよ
アスナ
1640063_9_a
うん、まあ種族を変更した
わけじゃないからね
アスナ
1640063_8_a
でも髪の色とかは、
ウンディーネのまんまなのねー
1640063_7_a
えへへ、ありがとう～
アスナ
1640063_6_a
はい!
すっごく凛々しい感じです!
アスナさん!
シリカ
1640063_5_a
おおっ、カッコいい!
1640063_4_a
シリカ
1640063_3_a
1640063_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
ど、どうかな……?
アスナ
1640063_1_a
ふふっ、じゃあお願いね
アスナ
1640061_25_a
それはもちろん構いませんけど……
シリカ
1640061_24_a
当選した人とサラマンダーの
プレイヤー、あとは該当者のいる
パーティ全体が参加できるらしいんだ
アスナ
1640061_23_a
それよりもさ
二人もこのキャンペーンのクエスト、
手伝ってくれないかな?
アスナ
1640061_22_a
あ、あはは……
そ、それは別にどうでもいいんだ～
アスナ
1640061_21_a
どういうこと?
1640061_20_a
あっ……いやぁ
サラマンダーというよりもむしろ……
そのプレイヤーに、かな?
アスナ
1640061_19_a
確かサブアバターは
シルフでしたよね?
シリカ
1640061_18_a
アスナさん
サラマンダーにも
興味があったんですか?
シリカ
1640061_17_a
今回は限定的とはいえ、
本当に別種族の装備を着れるって
インフォ文面で念を押してたよ
アスナ
1640061_16_a
うん、前に一度種族を変更できるって
噂が流れたこともあったらしいけど、
結局あれは嘘だったみたいで……
アスナ
1640061_15_a
まさにお試し種族変更って感じね
あれ……そう言えば……
1640061_14_a
装備することでサラマンダーの能力も
少しだけ開花できるんだよ
アスナ
1640061_13_a
基本はできないからこその、
今回限りのキャンペーンってこと
らしいよ
アスナ
1640061_12_a
専用装備を……
そんなことができるんですか!?
シリカ
1640061_11_a
あっ、そう言えば聞いたことあるわ
確か一時的にサラマンダー専用装備を
着られるのよね
1640061_10_a
サラマンダー・キャンペーン?
シリカ
1640061_9_a
サラマンダー・キャンペーンって
いうのなんだけど……
アスナ
1640061_8_a
なんに申し込んでたの?
1640061_7_a
う、うん……
なんかダメ元で申し込んでた
抽選に当たったみたいで……
アスナ
1640061_6_a
確かメッセが届いて、
それを読んでたんですよね?
運営からでしたっけ?
シリカ
1640061_5_a
アスナ……どしたの?
1640061_4_a
シリカ
1640061_3_a
1640061_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
わっ……わわっ!
アスナ
1640061_1_a
Oh-you're right!
Hehehe.
Leafa
1640058_19_a
Hahaha! Leafa, you'd only have to
worry about that in real life!
Silica
1640058_18_a
Well, I guess since I slimmed
down, I won't have any trouble
getting into it!
Leafa
1640058_17_a
As if I'd say no!
But, y'know, this costume looks
kind of form-fitting...
Leafa
1640058_16_a
Thank you so much!
Silica
1640058_15_a
Count me in!
Leafa
1640058_14_a
Let me see... Ooh, it's super cute!
Yeah, of course I'll help! I kind
of want to try it on too!
Leafa
1640058_13_a
I'm trying to get everything
together for this witch outfit.
Could you help me too, Leafa?
Silica
1640058_12_a
I'm going with Asuna to gather
the materials I need for that
Halloween-exclusive costume...
Silica
1640058_11_a
You mean it? Well...
Silica
1640058_10_a
If there's anything I can do for
you in return, just say so!
Leafa
1640058_9_a
I really owe you one!
Leafa
1640058_8_a
Well, I still couldn't have done
it without you.
Leafa
1640058_7_a
Not at all! You're the one who
had the willpower to stick to
the plan, after all.
Silica
1640058_6_a
I owe it all to you and the
dieting plan you made for me!
Leafa
1640058_5_a
That's fantastic!
Silica
1640058_4_a
Yep! I'm back to the weight I was
before Halloween!
Leafa
1640058_3_a
Leafa? Don't tell me-!
Silica
1640058_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Silicaaaa!
Thank yooou!
Leafa
1640058_1_a
but if she wants to lose weight,
then she's got my support.
Kirito
1640057_33_a
Personally I think she's perfect
just the way she is,
Kirito
1640057_32_a
It wasn't any trouble at all!
I just hope she can stick to
the plan...
Silica
1640057_31_a
You're her friend, so it was
better that it came from you.
Thanks for your help.
Kirito
1640057_30_a
Great. Sorry about all of this,
but you heard her. With me, she
would've just dug in her heels.
Kirito
1640057_29_a
Oh, Kirito!
How'd I do?
Silica
1640057_28_a
Silica
Kirito
1640057_27_a
...
Silica
1640057_26_a
Good night, Leafa!
Silica
1640057_25_a
Alright, I'm going to log out.
Night, Silica!
Leafa
1640057_24_a
Yay!
Silica
1640057_23_a
Thanks, Silica. As of right now,
this is how I eat!
Leafa
1640057_22_a
Leafa...
Silica
1640057_21_a
But it's you, and you went through
all that trouble to come up with
this plan, so...I'll try.
Leafa
1640057_20_a
I'd probably tell him to stuff it
where the sun don't shine.
Leafa
1640057_19_a
I guess... If Kirito were the one
telling me to do this,
Leafa
1640057_18_a
...
Leafa
1640057_17_a
Do you think you can manage?
Silica
1640057_16_a
Ugh...
Leafa
1640057_15_a
Well, if you get hungry, you can
always have some carrots or
celery.
Silica
1640057_14_a
I can already hear my tummy
grumbling...
Leafa
1640057_13_a
And if you can, from soybeans
as well.
Silica
1640057_12_a
You'll want to get your animal
proteins from fish.
Silica
1640057_11_a
Why isn't there any meat
either?!
Leafa
1640057_10_a
Unless you're planning on entering
a bodybuilding contest any time
soon?
Silica
1640057_9_a
Y-You can't be serious...
Leafa
1640057_8_a
Yeah, but you already have plenty
of muscle, so you don't need to!
Silica
1640057_7_a
But, but, but! I thought you're
supposed to eat sweets after
working out to build muscle!
Leafa
1640057_6_a
Obviously!
Silica
1640057_5_a
Gah...!
N-No sweets...?!
Leafa
1640057_4_a
It should be completely balanced
nutritionally, so you don't have
to worry about that.
Silica
1640057_3_a
Leafa
1640057_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Okay, here's your totally tailored
eating plan, Le-I mean, Suguha!
Silica
1640057_1_a
Sure! I can use the VR simulator
to come up with a plan in no
time at all. Trust me!
Silica
1640055_26_a
Can you really do something like
that?
Leafa
1640055_25_a
I'll come up with the perfect
plan! Just give me a few minutes!
Silica
1640055_24_a
Anyway, the fact of the matter is
that the way you're eating is
having a negative effect on you.
Silica
1640055_23_a
N-Nothing!
Silica
1640055_22_a
What?!
What's that supposed to mean?!
Leafa
1640055_21_a
Yeah... In more ways than one...
Silica
1640055_20_a
B-But I'm a growing girl!
Leafa
1640055_19_a
Really?
Still...that's a good recipe for
weight gain...
Silica
1640055_18_a
B-But you won't sleep well if
you go to bed hungry!
Leafa
1640055_17_a
A bed-time snack, huh?
That's not a very good habit,
you know.
Silica
1640055_16_a
You get hungry at like ten at
night...
Leafa
1640055_15_a
And then?!
There's more to this?!
Silica
1640055_14_a
And then...
Leafa
1640055_13_a
Okay...
Silica
1640055_12_a
And then you sneak off to the
store and buy an onigiri or
something to munch on...
Leafa
1640055_11_a
Um... No, not really...
Silica
1640055_10_a
And how it's super embarrassing
when your tummy growls in the
middle of class?
Leafa
1640055_9_a
Ugh... Well... Y'know how you get
kinda hungry around ten in the
morning?
Leafa
1640055_8_a
Then why do you look guilty? You
can't fake your expression in VR!
Silica
1640055_7_a
I didn't leave anything out...
Leafa
1640055_6_a
If there's something you've left
out, then tell me. Otherwise I
can't balance your calories!
Silica
1640055_5_a
Huh...? What's with that shifty
look, Leafa?
Silica
1640055_4_a
Umm...
Leafa
1640055_3_a
Leafa
1640055_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
So you say you eat three square
meals a day, plus a light snack
around three...
Silica
1640055_1_a
That's true... Alright then,
Coach Silica. I'm listening.
Leafa
1640053_32_a
Of course! Think of it like kendo.
You can do it by yourself, but
having a coach makes it easier!
Silica
1640053_31_a
You will?
Leafa
1640053_30_a
It just takes a little practice!
I'll even help you.
Silica
1640053_29_a
Since you've got exercise down,
all you need to do to lose weight
is balance your eating habits!
Silica
1640053_28_a
Well, yes, but if you've still gained
weight despite that, then maybe you're
eating more than you think.
Silica
1640053_27_a
Why? I do kendo every day! Do
you know how much of a workout
that is?
Leafa
1640053_26_a
Yeah... Well, maybe you should
try dieting!
Silica
1640053_25_a
Tell me about it... And it's all
so tasty, I just can't help
myself!
Leafa
1640053_24_a
Not to mention all the other fall
treats... It's like there's nothing they
won't flavor with pumpkin spice.
Silica
1640053_23_a
I see... Yeah, Halloween candy is
pretty much everywhere right now.
Silica
1640053_22_a
And there's all those special
sweets for sale, so...I might've
bought a ton and eaten 'em all...
Leafa
1640053_21_a
Oh, uh...
Well, it's Halloween and all...
Leafa
1640053_20_a
In any case, what could've caused
you to gain weight recently?
Silica
1640053_19_a
Ugh! I knew it!
That IS the image everyone has
of me...
Leafa
1640053_18_a
Umm... Ehehe...
Well...yes...
Silica
1640053_17_a
So, what? You're saying I eat more
in this imaginary world than I
do in the real one?
Leafa
1640053_16_a
Excuse me?!
Leafa
1640053_15_a
I feel like that would end up
hurting you more than helping
you...
Silica
1640053_14_a
Yeah... But then wouldn't that mean
you'd also gain calories from
anything you ate here?
Silica
1640053_13_a
sigh
... I wish you could burn
calories exercising in VRMMOs...
Leafa
1640053_12_a
Honestly, I-I swear...
Ehehehe...
Silica
1640053_11_a
Honestly this time?
Leafa
1640053_10_a
Silica... Look me in the eye and
tell me you didn't notice anything
different.
Leafa
1640053_9_a
R-Really? W-Well I didn't notice
anything different when I
saw you last in real life...
Silica
1640053_8_a
And this is a guy who wouldn't
notice any difference if you
totally changed your hairstyle!
Leafa
1640053_7_a
But Kirito could tell just by
looking at me!
Leafa
1640053_6_a
W-Well, you know what they say!
It's just a number on a scale!
Silica
1640053_5_a
I'm trying, but I'm still in
shock... I just can't believe I
gained that much weight...
Leafa
1640053_4_a
Oh, please cheer up, Leafa!
Silica
1640053_3_a
Silica
1640053_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
sigh
...
Leafa
1640053_1_a
Ha-hahahaha!
Of course not...!
Hahaha...
Suguha
1640051_21_a
You...gained weight, didn't you?
Kazuto
1640051_20_a
Geh-!
Suguha
1640051_19_a
I get it now.
Kazuto
1640051_18_a
Huh?
Suguha
1640051_17_a
Huh...? A-ha!
Kazuto
1640051_16_a
D-Don't be stupid!
Why would I do something
ridiculous like that?!
Kazuto
1640051_15_a
You aren't trying to sneak into
the bathroom again using this
as an excuse, are you?
Suguha
1640051_14_a
In any case, Kazuto...
Suguha
1640051_13_a
Sugu...?
Kazuto
1640051_12_a
Kazuto
1640051_11_a
I said everything's fine!
It's nothing, really!
Hahahaha!
Suguha
1640051_10_a
R-Really?
You screamed like a banshee...
Was it a bug or something?
Kazuto
1640051_9_a
K-Kazuto?
I-It's fine, everything's fine!
Nothing to see here!
Suguha
1640051_8_a
What happened?!
Kazuto
1640051_7_a
bg_18_suguha_room_lights_out
Sugu!
Are you okay?!
Kazuto
1640051_6_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_night
Gah!
What's going on?!
Kazuto
1640051_5_a
bg_18_suguha_room_lights_out
GAAAAAAAAAH!
Suguha
1640051_4_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_night
Huh? Is she talking
to someone in there...?
Kazuto
1640051_3_a
bg_18_suguha_room_lights_out
No way... Seriously...?
Seriously...!
Suguha
1640051_2_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_night
Hmm... Guess Sugu's still in the
bath. Maybe I'll dive in soon...
Kazuto
1640051_1_a
Yeah, well, you're a big dummy!
Leafa
1640048_25_a
You're such a little brat, Sugu!
Kirito
1640048_24_a
Hehe, that's for sure.
Asuna
1640048_23_a
Y'know, I can never tell if
they're serious or just messing
around. Same difference, I guess...
Liz
1640048_22_a
First of all, that's NOT what they
call me, and second of all,
shut UP!
Leafa
1640048_21_a
See, this is why they call you
that Speed Hole-whatever-thing!
Kirito
1640048_20_a
I have an older brother too, so
I should know.
Asuna
1640048_19_a
That's just what siblings do!
The closer they are,
the more they bicker.
Asuna
1640048_18_a
You think so? I feel like all
they did was bicker...
Liz
1640048_17_a
Hehehe, but it's good you two
went. I can tell the quality time
together did you a world of good.
Asuna
1640048_16_a
Um, Silica? I think you're
imagining things. I mean, avatars
CAN'T look worse for wear...
Liz
1640048_15_a
You do kind of look worse for
wear, Kirito...
Silica
1640048_14_a
Sounds like not going was
definitely the right call.
Liz
1640048_13_a
Th-That is NOT true!
Leafa
1640048_12_a
The strong breeze only made it
FEEL like you were flying faster.
Kirito
1640048_11_a
That was because the wind tribe
upped the Jewel's output to clear
all the fog from the valley.
Kirito
1640048_10_a
Did too! Remember the third time
I tried it?
Leafa
1640048_9_a
Yeah, "timing" had nothing
to do with it.
Kirito
1640048_8_a
Oh, come on, you KNOW I almost
had it down! I just needed to
tweak my timing a bit more!
Leafa
1640048_7_a
Silica was right to compare it
to getting thrown around
in a violent storm.
Kirito
1640048_6_a
We definitely got up to
some good speeds, but...
Kirito
1640048_5_a
Well, not exactly...
Leafa
1640048_4_a
Kirito
1640048_3_a
Leafa
1640048_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
So, did you break the
speed barrier, Leafa?
Asuna
1640048_1_a
Ahaha!
Leafa
1640047_22_a
...Hehe.
Kirito
1640047_21_a
W-Well, it takes one to know one!
Leafa
1640047_20_a
Well, yeah, 'cause you were.
Kirito
1640047_19_a
You're making it sound like
I was some spoiled little brat!
Leafa
1640047_18_a
Yeah, you're right...
Hey-wait a minute!
Leafa
1640047_17_a
I mean, it was like this when we
were little, right? You dragging
me along, me digging my heels in.
Kirito
1640047_16_a
Kazuto...
Leafa
1640047_15_a
But I want to make up
for all that wasted time...
Kirito
1640047_14_a
Maybe we grew up without ever
realizing that we both felt so
distant from the other...
Kirito
1640047_13_a
We didn't really have many
chances to hang out like this,
did we?
Kirito
1640047_12_a
The past couple of years...
And I mean before SAO...
Kirito
1640047_11_a
You've got it all wrong.
Kirito
1640047_10_a
Sugu...
Kirito
1640047_9_a
Maybe I shouldn't have forced
you to come with me...
Leafa
1640047_8_a
You...don't like hanging out
with me in ALO after all,
do you, Kazuto?
Leafa
1640047_7_a
Geez...
Kirito
1640047_6_a
Well, yeah! I just want to see you
flailing-I mean, flying around
a few more times!
Leafa
1640047_5_a
You going to just stand there,
or are you going to actually
try this out yourself?
Kirito
1640047_4_a
pant
pant
...
Kirito
1640047_3_a
No, no, no! You have to tilt your
wings INTO the wind!
Leafa
1640047_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
Gaaaaaahh!!
Kirito
1640047_1_a
How else would I?!
Kirito
1640045_27_a
Weeeeell, if that's how you want
to interpret it...
Leafa
1640045_26_a
So I'm supposed to mess up and be
your "bad example," is that it?!
Kirito
1640045_25_a
...
Kirito
1640045_24_a
Getting a good look at what not to
do helps you fine-tune your
own weaknesses, after all.
Leafa
1640045_23_a
Learning from other's mistakes.
Leafa
1640045_22_a
Is...?
Kirito
1640045_21_a
The first is practice, practice,
practice! And the second is...
Leafa
1640045_20_a
Learning to fly in ALO only takes
two things, but they're really
important!
Leafa
1640045_19_a
...?
Kirito
1640045_18_a
Grrr... You don't get it!
Leafa
1640045_17_a
Well, then why not just go by
yourself? There's nothing stopping
you from trying it out solo.
Kirito
1640045_16_a
But still, flying with your own
two wings is way more fun than
being strapped into a coaster!
Leafa
1640045_15_a
Really?
Leafa
1640045_14_a
you're still going way
faster than any roller coaster.
Kirito
1640045_13_a
Dude, even if you fly slow,
Kirito
1640045_12_a
Like with roller coasters!
Leafa
1640045_11_a
No way! That thrill is what
makes it so fun!
Leafa
1640045_10_a
You can really FEEL it.
It'd actually be pretty scary
to go any faster, don't you think?
Kirito
1640045_9_a
I mean, the default flying speed
is already pretty fast. And it's
not like you're just floating.
Kirito
1640045_8_a
What?
Leafa
1640045_7_a
I'm...not sure how to answer that.
Kirito
1640045_6_a
So, you're chickening out on me
too?
Leafa
1640045_5_a
Give me a second and I'll come
up with something...
Kirito
1640045_4_a
Come on! You're the only one
who's not trying to wriggle
their way out of coming with me!
Leafa
1640045_3_a
Leafa
1640045_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
What are you looking at me for?
Kirito
1640045_1_a
What?

Kirito
1640043_32_a
Silica
1640043_31_a
Asuna
1640043_30_a
Well, if you three are out...
That just leaves...
Leafa
1640043_29_a
Th-That's not what I meant at all!
Asuna
1640043_28_a
How could you, Asuna?
Silica
1640043_27_a
Oh, so like me and Silica ARE?
Is that what you're implying?!
Liz
1640043_26_a
A-And I'm not making that up
as an excuse or anything, okay?!
Asuna
1640043_25_a
I'm really sorry, Leafa, but
I have to go meet up with
my mom after this...
Asuna
1640043_24_a
I can hardly keep up with you guys
as it is, let alone if we're gonna
be going faster than normal...
Liz
1640043_23_a
Y'know, flying really isn't
my strong suit...
Liz
1640043_22_a
Seriously?
Leafa
1640043_21_a
I'm sorry, but... I'm
going to have to pass on this...
Silica
1640043_20_a
Um... Well, I just...
I got so sick when we got
caught up in that sandstorm, so...
Silica
1640043_19_a
What do you mean "we"?!
Liz
1640043_18_a
Wait, what?!
Asuna
1640043_17_a
We're not going to borrow it.
We're going back to that village
and trying it out in person!
Leafa
1640043_16_a
The people of Butterfly Valley
treasure it above all else. They
won't just let you "borrow" it!
Silica
1640043_15_a
B-But how are you going
to borrow the Jewel's power?
Silica
1640043_14_a
That hits it on the nose...
Asuna
1640043_13_a
Dang, Leafa, your need for speed
is turning into more of an
acceleration obsession...
Liz
1640043_12_a
W-Well, yeah, but...
Leafa
1640043_11_a
You think? So this is all just
some sort of rumor you heard?
Kirito
1640043_10_a
...I think.
Leafa
1640043_9_a
N-No, it isn't! You're borrowing
the Jewel's power to temporarily
strengthen your wings!
Leafa
1640043_8_a
That's basically just like taking
advantage of a strong gust to
boost you along, isn't it?
Silica
1640043_7_a
That's...
Liz
1640043_6_a
Oh, um...
Asuna
1640043_5_a
...
Kirito
1640043_4_a
and if you ride those winds,
you can fly way faster
than normal!
Leafa
1640043_3_a
Kirito
1640043_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Okay, get this! You can create
atmospheric waves-like, really
strong winds-using the Jewel,
Leafa
1640043_1_a
Just spit it out already!
Kirito
1640041_22_a
But this is top-secret info I'm
about to share! None of it leaves
this room, got it?
Leafa
1640041_21_a
Hehehe... Patience! I want to
savor the looks on your faces
when you find out...
Leafa
1640041_20_a
What do you mean?
Silica
1640041_19_a
Only everything! Apparently,
you can use the Jewel of Serenity
to do something amazing!
Leafa
1640041_18_a
Yeah, but what's that got
to do with anything?
Liz
1640041_17_a
that had stolen it from the
wind tribe of Butterfly Valley?
Leafa
1640041_16_a
So you know how we recovered the
Jewel of Serenity from the goblins
Leafa
1640041_15_a
Really? What'd you hear?
Asuna
1640041_14_a
and I heard something kind of
shocking...
Leafa
1640041_13_a
Well, I just went to see Sakuya,
Leafa
1640041_12_a
Hehehe...
So, um, Leafa,
what kept you?
Silica
1640041_11_a
Says the guy who literally JUST
arrived himself!
Liz
1640041_10_a
Only for forever!
Kirito
1640041_9_a
Hey! Sorry, guys! I didn't keep
you waiting long, did I?
Leafa
1640041_8_a
Maybe she's buried under
a mountain of homework...
Kirito
1640041_7_a
I thought for sure she'd make it
back here before me.
What could be keeping her?
Kirito
1640041_6_a
Sugu's not here yet?
Kirito
1640041_5_a
Good evening, Kirito!
We're still waiting on Leafa...
Silica
1640041_4_a
There you are, Kirito.
Asuna
1640041_3_a
You aren't even CLOSE to being
on time, Kirito!
Liz
1640041_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
I'm here, I'm here!
Kirito
1640041_1_a
Aha. Ha...
Asuna
1640028_31_a
Y-Yes, Liz. R-Right behind you...
Silica
1640028_30_a
Revenge quest, activated! GO TIME!
Liz
1640028_29_a
Umm... Y-Yeah, sounds...great.
Asuna
1640028_28_a
Oh, it will be so much fun...
Muhahahahahaha!!!
Liz
1640028_27_a
Oh, all the better!
We can torture him for days
without him going and dying on us!
Liz
1640028_26_a
Let's just forget this one, okay?
Please? Besides, the town's a safe
zone. We can't kill him here...
Asuna
1640028_25_a
Wrong! I will end him! A blacksmith
never shows mercy! I will hammer
my debt out of his SOUL!
Liz
1640028_24_a
Ahaha... Liz? You're scaring me.
Let's just write this one off, kay?
We learned about magic too! Right?
Asuna
1640028_23_a
Luckily, ALO's all about the PvP.
Muhaha... MWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Liz
1640028_22_a
We WILL find him! And when we
do, he will regret the day he
messed with us!
Liz
1640028_21_a
W-Well, yes...b-but...
Silica
1640028_20_a
Silica! You remember what he looks
like, right?!
Liz
1640028_19_a
W-Wait, what?
Silica
1640028_18_a
Find the dirty snake that lied
about this quest and SHATTER HIM.
Liz
1640028_17_a
Huh?! Ready to do what?!
Asuna
1640028_16_a
But that comes later! Silica!
Asuna! You ready to do this?!
Liz
1640028_15_a
I think I'll look into them...
Liz
1640028_14_a
I'm with you there, Silica.
I hear us Leprechauns have
our own special spells too.
Liz
1640028_13_a
Chirp!
Pina
1640028_12_a
I'm going to go learn a spell too!
Silica
1640028_11_a
Today has really driven home just
how important magic is in ALO.
Silica
1640028_10_a
You said it!
Silica
1640028_9_a
All's well that ends well, right?
Asuna
1640028_8_a
If it wasn't for you, we'd never
have survived against those
monsters or finished that quest.
Liz
1640028_7_a
Asuna, that healing magic of yours
is the most amazing thing EVER.
Liz
1640028_6_a
Ahaha, you two are ridiculous!
Asuna
1640028_5_a
I can taste the sweet joy of life!
I've never been so happy...

Asuna

Asunaaa!

1640027_26_a
That's right, girls, but we've got
our backs to the wall! I've gotta
risk it!
Asuna
1640027_25_a
D-Does this make you a g-gambler?!
Gambling's bad, Asuna!
Silica
1640027_24_a
What?! That's reckless!
Liz
1640027_23_a
At my current level, I've only got
a twenty percent chance. It'll
use all my MP, too...
Asuna
1640027_22_a
I'm casting a new water spell I've
been practicing! If this works,
it'll heal all of us!
Asuna
1640027_21_a
Asuna? What are you planning?
Liz
1640027_20_a
Alright! Desperate times call for
desperate measures! It's worth
a shot!
Asuna
1640027_19_a
I guess you have a point...
Asuna
1640027_18_a
Th-That may be so, but I'm with
Liz... Death is scary! I don't
wanna die either!
Silica
1640027_17_a
Even if they get us, we'll just
respawn. The death penalty
will hurt though...
Asuna
1640027_16_a
L-Liz! Don't be so dramatic!
This isn't SAO!
Asuna
1640027_15_a
Are we... Are we gonna die?
I don't wanna die!
Liz
1640027_14_a
Umm, focus please...? We're
surrounded by mobs and
nearly out of HP...
Asuna
1640027_13_a
Waaaaaah!
I'm so sorry I was bamgloobled!
Silica
1640027_12_a
Silica, chill out. There's no
shame here. It happens to
everyone.
Liz
1640027_11_a
Hey! I've never been bam...
bamboodled! Or messed with!
Silica
1640027_10_a
I don't think I would use the word
"bamboozled" here-or ever. Let's
say she was 'messed with,' okay?
Asuna
1640027_9_a
What?! No way!
Silica
1640027_8_a
Silica, you're way too gullible!
You've been bamboozled again!
Liz
1640027_7_a
No matter how you slice it, this
is definitely NOT for newbies...
Asuna
1640027_6_a
The player I talked to in town
said that this was a really easy
quest!
Silica
1640027_5_a
Forgive me, Liz! I didn't know!
Silica
1640027_4_a
Silica
1640027_3_a
Asuna

bg_event_dungeon_alo
AHH! HELP!!
I didn't sign up for this!!
Liz
1640027_1_a
Sounds like fun! Count me in!
Asuna
1640025_21_a
It'll be a breeze!
Silica
1640025_20_a
We're still ALO newbies though,
so Silica and I found a nice and
easy one.
Liz
1640025_19_a
You're right, I totally forgot.
Liz
1640025_18_a
Oh yeah, I almost forgot!
We were about to go questing!
Silica
1640025_17_a
Chiiirp!
Pina
1640025_16_a
Ahaha, I guess so.
Asuna
1640025_15_a
But specialties aside, the very
fact that you've memorized all
this info is still impressive!
Liz
1640025_14_a
That's a good point...
Liz
1640025_13_a
In ALO, that means we need to
be masters of magic.
Asuna
1640025_12_a
But us water fairies-Undines-
specialize in party support.
Asuna
1640025_11_a
And Silica, you're a Cait Sith,
so you're made to tame pets...
Asuna
1640025_10_a
Liz, you're a Leprechaun,
so you're great at crafting.
Asuna
1640025_9_a
In ALO, different races are good
at different things, right?
Asuna
1640025_8_a
No, I think you've got it wrong.
Asuna
1640025_7_a
What she said!
Asuna, you're incredible!
Silica
1640025_6_a
Maybe it's 'cause you hang with
Kirito and Leafa so much?
Liz
1640025_5_a
but you know way more than us
about magic.
Liz
1640025_4_a
Silica
1640025_3_a
Asuna
1640025_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Seriously though, Asuna, I'm
impressed. We've been diving in
ALO about the same amount of time,
Liz
1640025_1_a
I can get behind that!
Silica
1640023_20_a
Our best bet is to find spells
that suit us, then level them
up like crazy!
Asuna
1640023_19_a
And, while a lot of spells are for
combat, there's just as many that
have other uses!
Asuna
1640023_18_a
That's what I thought at first
too.
Asuna
1640023_17_a
Agreed! I had thought magic was
all about attacking or healing
people.
Liz
1640023_16_a
WOW! That was so amazing!
Magic looks like so much fun!
Silica
1640023_15_a
The effect is skill-based.
At my current skill level, it'll
only last a few seconds.
Asuna
1640023_14_a
That was quick...
Liz
1640023_13_a
Ah! It faded already...
Asuna
1640023_12_a
This is like that, but MAGIC!
Asuna
1640023_11_a
We had the Hiding skill in SAO,
and some items with similar
effects.
Asuna
1640023_10_a
This is concealment magic!
Asuna
1640023_9_a
B-But if you look hard enough...
I think I can kinda see her?
Kinda?
Liz
1640023_8_a
What the-?!
Asuna's gone!! She's GONE!!!
Silica
1640023_7_a
Krellr ath myrkr!
Huth likami!
Asuna
1640023_6_a
I asked Leafa to teach me a little
bit... Well, here goes nothing...
Asuna
1640023_5_a
So, about this Old Norse...
Liz
1640023_4_a
Silica
1640023_3_a
Asuna
1640023_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Bah! Forget studying! Practice
makes perfect! I'm gonna get out
there and bust out some magic!
Liz
1640023_1_a
B-But who knows...
Maybe it'll help?
Asuna
1640021_25_a
W-Wow, that's dedication...
I don't think you have to major in
linguistics for this, though...
Asuna
1640021_24_a
Do you think it would be a good
idea to study this Old Norse so
I can pronounce these magic words?
Silica
1640021_23_a
Then they mashed them all together
into fantasy soup, and voila!
You have ALO!
Asuna
1640021_22_a
They also pulled monsters and
places and so on from myths all
over the world.
Asuna
1640021_21_a
It does seem to fit!
But still, that's just the
foundation of the game.
Asuna
1640021_20_a
I guess it's the perfect backdrop
for a fantasy game, huh?
Liz
1640021_19_a
Yeaaah! Those are the ones with
all the beardy gods and giants
that drink mead and fight, right?
Liz
1640021_18_a
According to Kirito, there are a
lot of games that draw on Norse
myths for inspiration.
Asuna
1640021_17_a
Yup! ALO is based loosely on
Norse mythology.
Asuna
1640021_16_a
Norse... Wait a sec...
Wasn't ALO...
Silica
1640021_15_a
I hear it's a dialect of ancient
Norse. Leafa told me it was an
old Scandinavian language.
Asuna
1640021_14_a
Seriously. Are these spells in
some sort of weird alien code?!
Liz
1640021_13_a
We were just talking about that
very subject!
Silica
1640021_12_a
Yeah, but it's really hard to
remember how to pronounce the
spells!
Asuna
1640021_11_a
We were just talking about magic
here in ALO. It seems like it's
a really big part of the game.
Liz
1640021_10_a
Hey there!
So, what are you two up to?
Asuna
1640021_9_a
Hello, Asuna! Nice to see you.
Silica
1640021_8_a
Silica
1640021_7_a
Hey, Asuna! Over here!
Liz
1640021_6_a
Liz!
Silica!
Asuna
1640021_5_a
this game is different in a lot of
ways.
Silica
1640021_4_a
Yes, that's right. Even though
this game and SAO run on the
same engine,
Silica
1640021_3_a
Silica
1640021_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
So I have to chant or something
to cast a spell?
Liz
1640021_1_a
Ahaha!
Rain
1640018_30_a
Hehehe!
Seven
1640018_29_a
Now you're just being dumb!
Rain
1640018_28_a
It's a pretty high horse.
I doubt you'll be able to reach!
Seven
1640018_27_a
You won't be so haughty
once I knock you down from
that high horse of yours!
Rain
1640018_26_a
Hehe. Good luck with that,
big sister.
Seven
1640018_25_a
I'm not going to lose to some
little girl who only sings
whenever the mood strikes her!
Rain
1640018_24_a
Don't you dare forget it,
especially with one standing
right in front of you!
Rain
1640018_23_a
But you're right! Using your
former popularity as a crutch is
totally unfair to true performers!
Rain
1640018_22_a
Rain...
Seven
1640018_21_a
I understand, Seven. If that's
what you want to do, then
I'll support you however I can.
Rain
1640018_20_a
I still want to be able to appease
the part of me that loves to sing.
Seven
1640018_19_a
But, even though science
is my true calling,
Seven
1640018_18_a
and that my popularity will suffer
the less I perform...
Seven
1640018_17_a
I know it's kind of a slight to
people who do perform with
all their heart and soul,
Seven
1640018_16_a
Huh?
Rain
1640018_15_a
I should just put on another
one-night-only concert like before.
Seven
1640018_14_a
But that's why I was thinking that
whenever I get the urge to sing,
Seven
1640018_13_a
Geez...
Rain
1640018_12_a
Ehehe... After a while I just
felt like singing like this again
for some reason.
Seven
1640018_11_a
You said you felt great after that
one-night-only concert, right?
Rain
1640018_10_a
It's not make-believe!
Well, I guess it is...
Seven
1640018_9_a
It's easy when you're lost in your
world of idol make-believe.
Rain
1640018_8_a
R-Rain! Quit sneaking up on me
like that!
Seven
1640018_7_a
At it again, I see...
Rain
1640018_6_a
I know, I feel the same! But all
good things must come to an end.
I hope you enjoy this final song!
Seven
1640018_5_a
We just got heeeere!
Seven
1640018_4_a
It can't be over yeeet!
Seven
1640018_3_a
Nooooo!
Seven
1640018_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
My, how time flies! We've
already come to my last song
of the evening...
Seven
1640018_1_a
Me too! This is a one-time
thing, so we better enjoy it!
Asuna
1640017_22_a
Hehe, I'm getting pretty excited!

1640017_21_a
Let's!
Silica
1640017_20_a
Alright, let's head over
to our seats. Sinon and Leafa
are already there.
Kirito
1640017_19_a
Hahaha!
Kirito
1640017_18_a
Yeesh... Your Seven-fever is
relapsing with a vengeance,
Klein.
Liz
1640017_17_a
We've been waiting patiently for
her triumphant return ever since
her last appearance!
Klein
1640017_16_a
Uh, of course we are!
Seven's fans have always loved her
and always will!
Klein
1640017_15_a
but her fans seem as eager as ever
to listen to her sing.
Asuna
1640017_14_a
I would have thought her research
might have had a negative impact,
Asuna
1640017_13_a
It's amazing that so many people
are coming to such a small venue
just to see Seven, isn't it?
Asuna
1640017_12_a
That's for sure.
Liz
1640017_11_a
That's why I got in touch with
everyone. It's a special occasion!
Kirito
1640017_10_a
Whoa...
I didn't know she still sang.
Liz
1640017_9_a
is giving a one night only
performance!
Klein

You'll never believe it!
ALO's princess of song, Seven,

1640017_7_a
K-Klein? What's going on?

Asuna...
Rain
1640015_28_a
Kirito...
Seven
1640015_27_a
Evening, you two.
Asuna
1640015_26_a
Sounds like you've settled things.
Kirito
1640015_25_a
Rain...
Seven
1640015_24_a
You won't know until you try.
Rain
1640015_23_a
Don't be. This is an imaginary
world where dreams come true,
after all.
Rain
1640015_22_a
B-But I'm still too nervous
to do anything like that...
Seven
1640015_21_a
If it doesn't feel right,
then don't.
Rain
1640015_20_a
You should sing in front of a live
audience again. If that makes you
happy, then be an idol.
Rain
1640015_19_a
No? Then what should I do?
Seven
1640015_18_a
Though I don't think staging
pretend concerts like this will
help you figure out your feelings.
Rain
1640015_17_a
Seven... Rainbow, maybe it's better
if you keep thinking it over until
you reach a solid conclusion.
Rain
1640015_16_a
Oh, why can't I make up my mind...
Seven
1640015_15_a
I think I really do want
to become one again.
Maybe.
Seven
1640015_14_a
Heh, sorry, Rain...
As much as I'd like to say
I've retired as an idol,
Seven
1640015_13_a
Seven...
Rain
1640015_12_a
Do I truly want to return to the
life of an ALO idol, even if that
means less time for research?
Seven
1640015_11_a
Do I truly want to bathe in the
admiration of thousands, as I did
as a Pooka songstress?
Seven
1640015_10_a
Do I truly want to sing?
Seven
1640015_9_a
What do you mean?
Rain
1640015_8_a
Yeah... You're right. But...
I'm not even sure myself.
Seven
1640015_7_a
So even if you aren't researching
anything now, that doesn't mean
you have to give up singing too.
Rain
1640015_6_a
You also told me you liked singing
in and of itself.
Rain
1640015_5_a
since your goal was to collect
data on the audience's emotions
for your research, but...
Rain
1640015_4_a
You did kind of use it
as a means to an end
Rain
1640015_3_a
Seven, if you want to start
singing again, I'm not going
to stop you.
Rain
1640015_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Seven
1640015_1_a
Yeah. We'll go see them
once things have settled down.
Asuna
1640013_16_a
No. They're still in the middle of
things, so we're going to wait
and see how everything turns out.
Kirito
1640013_15_a
So you aren't going over to them?
Agil
1640013_14_a
Asuna...
Kirito
1640013_13_a
That's just how siblings are.
Asuna
1640013_12_a
I'm sure they'll work things out
with enough time.
Asuna
1640013_11_a
Maybe that's why? Or, no... Maybe
despite growing up separately,
they've always shared a bond.
Asuna
1640013_10_a
Hrmm. For sisters who have finally
reunited with one another, they
certainly are quick to argue.
Kirito
1640013_9_a
Erm, less fighting, more...
bantering?
Agil
1640013_8_a
Are they fighting?!
Asuna
1640013_7_a
Those two have been at it over
there for a while now.
Agil
1640013_6_a
We're looking for Rain and Seven.
Kirito
1640013_5_a
Evening, Agil!
Asuna
1640013_4_a
Hey there, you two.
Agil

...
Rain
1640011_20_a
N-No, that's not it...
Seven
1640011_19_a
but you've never felt quite whole
not being an idol, have you?
Rain
1640011_18_a
You said singing was just part
of your research and gave it up,
Rain
1640011_17_a
N-No, that's not quite it...
Seven
1640011_16_a
You were even playing the part of
the audience... Do you want to
be a singer again?
Rain
1640011_15_a
N-No, that's not it...
Seven
1640011_14_a
So, what was that, anyway?
Were you rehearsing or something?
Rain
1640011_13_a
Yes, sir!
Seven
1640011_12_a
Don't worry about it.
Seven, try not to be too loud.
Agil
1640011_11_a
Aah, Master! I'm sorry, I didn't
mean it like that!
Rain
1640011_10_a
Apologies, I know this place is no
Hollywood Bowl.
Agil
1640011_9_a
I'm the one who should be saying
that. What're you doing giving a
pretend concert here?
Rain
1640011_8_a
Waaa!
O-Oh, hey, Rain...
You startled me!
Seven
1640011_7_a
What are you doing, Seven?
Rain
1640011_6_a
I hope you enjoy it! This song
is dedicated to you, my adoring
fans!
Seven
1640011_5_a
Oooooh!
Seven
1640011_4_a
I'd like to perform my new song
for every last one of you!
Seven
1640011_3_a
Spasibaaaaaa!
Seven
1640011_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Everyone, bolshoe spasiba for
coming to see me!
Seven
1640011_1_a
You don't have to tell me twice!
Yuuki
1450048_29_a
Yeah. Let's pretend to help,
but not really try.
Kirito
1450048_28_a
Aw, Asuna noticed. I guess it's
weird if we're not chasing the
joker too, huh?
Yuuki
1450048_27_a
Kirito! Yuuki! Stop standing
around giggling and HELP!!
Asuna
1450048_26_a
Hehe, you bet!
Yuuki
1450048_25_a
It fits the playing card motif
and definitely helps make the
whole place more interesting!
Kirito
1450048_24_a
Either way, I like having this
mysterious figure popping up
all over the place.
Kirito
1450048_23_a
Ha ha ha, well, I haven't said who
it is yet!
Kirito
1450048_22_a
Wow... You've got it all figured
out!
Yuuki
1450048_21_a
Well, that's the whole job of the
joker, isn't it? Insert a bit of
uncertainty into our lives.
Kirito
1450048_20_a
Hanging around the king and queen
makes us think "assassin," but
there's no attempt at regicide.
Kirito
1450048_19_a
Yeah. They're running around
sowing chaos and confusion, right?
Kirito
1450048_18_a
You figured out who the joker
really is, Kirito?
Yuuki
1450048_17_a
Actually, never mind. I'm sure you
have some reason you don't want
to tell us.
Kirito
1450048_16_a
Ha ha ha, you don't have to try
to hide it. I know that the joker
is really...
Kirito
1450048_15_a
Hmm... Naaah.
Yuuki
1450048_14_a
You're not going after him today?
Kirito
1450048_13_a
Ah! Hi Kirito, what's up?
Yuuki
1450048_12_a
Uhh, Yuuki?
Kirito
1450048_11_a
...
Yuuki
1450048_10_a
I'll go after him too! We need to
do whatever we can to stop him!
Asuna
1450048_9_a
Yeah! And don't forget, we have
to protect the king and queen!
Player B
1450048_8_a
Got it! We'll use the buffs we got
from those card titles to put
an end to his tricks and games!
Player A
1450048_7_a
Careful! He took out a whole party
of players who went after him
last time!
Player B
1450048_6_a
It's the joker assassin!
After him!
Player A
1450048_5_a
Kirito
1450048_4_a
Yuuki

Joker
1450048_1_a
But at least I know why you're
running solo right now!
Yuuki
1450047_38_a
Okay, I'll be honest.
You lost me at "chaos."
Yuuki
1450047_37_a
...Or at least, that's what the
joker told me.
Sinon
1450047_36_a
It is times like this that the
joker must bring a dash of
chaos to stir the pot.
Sinon
1450047_35_a
The mad king has regained his
sanity, and players earn titles
and fight great battles...
Sinon
1450047_34_a
This area totters on the brink of
great change...
Sinon
1450047_33_a
In both the good sense
and the bad.
Yuuki
1450047_32_a
I guess that makes sense.
The joker always makes card
games more exciting, for sure.
Yuuki
1450047_31_a
It's the joker's job to cause
chaos, and so make the world
a more interesting place.
Sinon
1450047_30_a
The joker's an entertainer, one
who livens up the world by casting
a stone into a still pool...
Sinon
1450047_29_a
I suppose you could phrase it
that way, yes.
Sinon
1450047_28_a
Chaos? Like, cause a bunch of
trouble?
Yuuki
1450047_27_a
Cause chaos.
Sinon
1450047_26_a
What?
Yuuki
1450047_25_a
I'll simplify. The joker asked me
to do something in his place.
Sinon
1450047_24_a
I'm not following.
Yuuki
1450047_23_a
The real joker still exists, but I
sort of...inherited the title.
Sinon
1450047_22_a
It's...a long story.
Sinon
1450047_21_a
But why are you the joker?
Yuuki
1450047_20_a
Whaaaaaat?! Sinon?
You changed your avatar?
Yuuki
1450047_19_a
Yuuki
1450047_18_a
It's me.
Sinon
1450047_17_a
They...are?
Yuuki
1450047_16_a
Well, I suppose I can let you in
on the secret, Yuuki.
???
1450047_15_a
...
???
1450047_14_a
So you're the joker, huh? Are you
really trying to assassinate the
king and queen?
Yuuki
1450047_13_a
...
???
1450047_12_a
Caught you!
Yuuki
1450047_11_a
...
???
1450047_10_a
Asuna
1450047_9_a
Kirito
1450047_8_a
Got it!
Yuuki
1450047_7_a
Yuuki, go! This is all you!
Asuna
1450047_6_a
The massive agility boost from her
ace of clubs makes her too fast
for us to keep up with!
Asuna
1450047_5_a
Gah! Yuuki's so fast!!
Kirito
1450047_4_a
Asuna
1450047_3_a
Kirito
1450047_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Annnd DAAAAAASH!!!
Yuuki
1450047_1_a
Yeah!
Kirito
1450045_21_a
He was kind of a weirdo!
Let's go check it out!
Asuna
1450045_20_a
Oooh! Do you think that's the
joker?!
Yuuki
1450045_19_a
Hey, over there!
Weirdo sighted!
???
1450045_18_a
He was definitely a strange guy,
but he didn't seem like a bad
person to me...
Asuna
1450045_17_a
He helped us out, sure, but I
guess he could be this assassin...
Kirito
1450045_16_a
He gave us our second card slots.
Apparently, he's a rare character!
Asuna
1450045_15_a
Yeah. He was wearing a black cloak
and everything.
Asuna
1450045_14_a
Joker, huh? Asuna, didn't you say
you ran into him when you were
doing this dungeon?
Yuuki
1450045_13_a
So, we came to the conclusion that
he's the joker, and an assassin.
Certainly looked the part.
Player B
1450045_12_a
...
Kirito
1450045_11_a
Well, we saw this creepy clown in
a black cloak. We figured he was
pretty suspicious...
Player A
1450045_10_a
Yeah.
Asuna
1450045_9_a
Sure. You heard that rumor about
the assassin after the king's
head, right?
Player A
1450045_8_a
We'd appreciate it if you filled
us in.
Asuna
1450045_7_a
Assassin? Joker? That sounds cool!
Yuuki
1450045_6_a
Asuna
1450045_5_a
Yuuki
1450045_4_a
Hey there, you two.
What are you talking about?
Kirito
1450045_3_a
Think that was the joker assassin
everyone's talking about?
Player B
1450045_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
What the heck was up with
that?
Player A
1450045_1_a
...
Yuuki
1450043_19_a
I just checked my friend list,
and she's in the area...
Asuna
1450043_18_a
Me neither... Maybe she had
something to do?
Asuna
1450043_17_a
Hey, where DID she get off to?
I haven't seen her for a while...
Kirito
1450043_16_a
She was with you for this whole
3D Labyrinth quest, right?
Yuuki
1450043_15_a
But I've been wondering...
Where did Sinon go?
Yuuki
1450043_14_a
Yup, I know! I swear I'll do my
best to protect the king!
Yuuki
1450043_13_a
Ugh, can you guys please stop
kidding around? I'm being serious
here!
Asuna
1450043_12_a
Ha ha ha, yeah. Ace of clubs,
and ace defender!
Kirito
1450043_11_a
Sure! I'm a bodyguard, ha ha!
That's so awesome!
Oooh, and I'm an ace too!
Yuuki
1450043_10_a
No, that'd be a real shame.
Yuuki, can you be his ace of
clubs bodyguard?
Asuna
1450043_9_a
But he's not crazy anymore!
We can't let someone kill him!
Yuuki
1450043_8_a
I mean, he did make a lot of
enemies when he was playing
the role of mad king.
Kirito
1450043_7_a
Well, it's probably just a bunch
of rebellious serfs who don't know
he's stopped being a jerk.
Kirito
1450043_6_a
Yeah, let's do it.
Asuna
1450043_5_a
There are some assassins after
the king's life, right?
Kirito
1450043_4_a
Yuuki
1450043_3_a
Asuna
1450043_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Yeah, I heard that rumor too.
Kirito
1450043_1_a
Well, it's like this...
Asuna
1450041_17_a
What sort of rumors?
Yuuki
1450041_16_a
But I've started hearing odd
rumors again...
Asuna
1450041_15_a
That's right. Luckily, the king's
come to his senses and isn't
being a weirdo anymore...
Asuna
1450041_14_a
The queen asked you to hand out
these card titles and buffs after
you beat the dungeon.
Yuuki
1450041_13_a
Yup!
Yuuki
1450041_12_a
I told you about the king and
queen who rule over this dungeon,
right?
Asuna
1450041_11_a
Hmm? What's with the sudden gloom?
Yuuki
1450041_10_a
Yeah, I guess...
Asuna
1450041_9_a
So, I just have to keep beating
up all of these monsters here in
the 3D Labyrinth, right?
Yuuki
1450041_8_a
Hehe, you're a blur of sword
and awesome!
Asuna
1450041_7_a
With the speed boost it gave me,
I can take out any monster before
they can say "Zekken"!
Yuuki
1450041_6_a
It's all thanks to you, Asuna!
I really appreciate that ace
of clubs!
Yuuki
1450041_5_a
Yuuki
1450041_4_a
You're in fine form today, Yuuki!
Asuna
1450041_3_a
Grawrk!

bg_event_wonderland
Take THIS!
Yuuki
1450041_1_a
Liz
1450038_19_a
Of course. Let's show the world
that you don't need levels to win:
just brains and talent.
Sinon
1450038_18_a
Yeah...to their deaths!
Let's crush these suckers!
Liz
1450038_17_a
I... Th-That's... Er...
Sinon
1450038_16_a
TO VICTORY!!
CHAAARGEEE!!!
???
1450038_15_a
Love ya too, Sinon. Seriously,
though, we make the perfect
team for this quest!
Liz
1450038_14_a
Heh. I'm glad you're on my side.
Sinon
1450038_13_a
That's why it only took me the
blink of an eye to make a field's
worth of stockades!
Liz
1450038_12_a
Bingo! I know my job's
"Bladesmith," but I can make
all sorts of cool stuff!
Liz
1450038_11_a
That means we don't have to worry
about a massed charge. One enemy
at a time.
Sinon
1450038_10_a
Aha. Only one horse should be able
to go through at once.
Sinon
1450038_9_a
Notice how I left little openings
between the fences at staggered
intervals? That's on purpose.
Liz
1450038_8_a
Fantastic. These will slow the
enemy down and break their ranks,
and let me kill them one by one.
Sinon
1450038_7_a
Yup! These should really help us
limit the enemy cavalry's
mobility.
Liz
1450038_6_a
A wooden stockade?
Sinon
1450038_5_a
And that's a wrap.
Hold your applause, please.
Liz
1450038_4_a
Wow...
Sinon
1450038_3_a
Sinon
1450038_2_a
bg_event_field
Heave HO!
Liz
1450038_1_a
Just watch, Sinon!
I'll have them up in a jiffy!
Liz
1450037_16_a
...What is?
Sinon
1450037_15_a
Hehe... Aww yeah! This is right
up my alley! It's Liz time!
Liz
1450037_14_a
And that is?
Sinon
1450037_13_a
I just remembered the other thing
Nobunaga used to beat Takeda's
cavalry!
Liz
1450037_12_a
However...what?
Sinon
1450037_11_a
YES! How did you not realize
that?! I mean... Oh!
Liz
1450037_10_a
Hm... Perhaps I was a bit reckless
in choosing this quest...
Sinon
1450037_9_a
Yeah, but not indefinitely!
There's at least a couple dozen
angry guys with swords over there!
Liz
1450037_8_a
Exactly. Luckily, my gun can lay
down sustained fire.
Sinon
1450037_7_a
Reloading guns from this era takes
a while, so he set up rotating
ranks to fire continuous volleys.
Liz
1450037_6_a
But Nobunaga only won Nagashino
because he had defenses, a genius
plan, and a whole army.
Liz
1450037_5_a
Okay, historically, guns made
cavalry obsolete, and I get
that...
Liz
1450037_4_a
You bet. I'm a Gunner, right?
I was looking for a quest that
would let me shine.
Sinon
1450037_3_a
Sinon
1450037_2_a
bg_event_field
Hold on a sec, Sinon. You're going
to try to recreate Nobunaga's
tactics...by yourself?
Liz
1450037_1_a
Hehe, now you get it.
Sinon
1450035_17_a
Uh...yeah, actually. Oda Nobunaga
fought Takeda Shingen's son,
Katsuyori, right? Oh! Ohhh!!
Liz
1450035_16_a
Have you ever heard of the
Battle of Nagashino?
Sinon
1450035_15_a
Okay, so you DO have a plan.
Liz
1450035_14_a
I'm smiling in anticipation.
And, by the way, "sniper" is your
hint on how we'll win this.
Sinon
1450035_13_a
Ugh, how could I forgot. You're
Sinon: ice-cold sniper and total
lunatic. How are you smiling?!
Liz
1450035_12_a
Hehe... Well, we'll just have to
try and see, won't we?
Sinon
1450035_11_a
We just started this game!
How are we supposed to take down
an army of mounted samurai?!
Liz
1450035_10_a
There are ONLY TWO OF US!!
Liz
1450035_9_a
So? This battle is based off one
from the Warring States period.
Of course there's lots of enemies.
Sinon
1450035_8_a
Because I see a small army of
enemy cavalry facing off against
us here!!
Liz
1450035_7_a
Interesting?!
Are you blind?!
Liz
1450035_6_a
Yes? It seemed like an interesting
quest.
Sinon
1450035_5_a
THIS is what you meant by killing
time?
Liz
1450035_4_a
Huh? What's wrong?
Sinon
1450035_3_a
Sinon
1450035_2_a
bg_event_field
Ugh, Sinon, what are we
doing here?
Liz
1450035_1_a
I suppose.
Let's go kill some time.
Sinon
1450033_18_a
Eh, I guess we don't have any
other choice. Waiting it is.
Liz
1450033_17_a
If you don't mind waiting, two
kimonos should be returned in
three or four hours.
Dry Goods Shopkeep
1450033_16_a
Still, you got to hand it to Asuna
and Alice. It only took them a day
to become fashion celebrities.
Liz
1450033_15_a
Raising demand by artificially
limiting supply? I know why they
do it, but I hate them for it.
Sinon
1450033_14_a
Well, not me, personally. It was
the developers. They made us do
it!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
1450033_13_a
So that's why you came up with
this ridiculous idea of stock and
limiting rental numbers?
Liz
1450033_12_a
They looked so good, people posted
about them in forums, and they
even made it onto MMO Today!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
1450033_11_a
Exactly! We rented kimonos to two
girls the other day, and they
really caused a stir!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
1450033_10_a
A kimono craze. In a Japanese
VRMMO. Surprise.
Sinon
1450033_9_a
Rare outfits make headlines, start
fads, and bring in customers!
We hope to start a kimono craze!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
1450033_8_a
Actually, we did this on purpose.
You see, we're aiming to keep
stock down and rarity up!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
1450033_7_a
Yeah! It's like a digital library
running out of books! I'm gonna
call management!
Liz
1450033_6_a
How does that even work?
It's an in-game shop. It's data!
How do they run out of stock?
Sinon
1450033_5_a
What?!
You're out of stock?!
Liz
1450033_4_a
Sinon
1450033_3_a
Liz
1450033_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
We're deeply sorry, but we don't
have any more kimonos available
for rental...
Dry Goods Shopkeep
1450033_1_a
Yup. Let's head in.
Sinon
1450031_19_a
Hey, there it is! That's the store
Alice and Asuna rented their
kimonos from!
Liz
1450031_18_a
Maybe.
Sinon
1450031_17_a
Maybe they were aiming for a more
realistic experience?
Liz
1450031_16_a
Kimonos are insanely expensive
in the real world too.
Liz
1450031_15_a
Yeah, that'd probably get a bunch
of people pumped to join. Still,
I suppose they had their reasons.
Liz
1450031_14_a
It'd be great PR to have players
posting screenshots of their
kimono-clad characters online.
Sinon
1450031_13_a
I'm surprised, though. As a Japan-
themed VRMMO, I thought they'd
be giving the things away.
Sinon
1450031_12_a
Yeah. Then again, we're new here
and basically penniless, so cheap
or not, it feels like a lot...
Sinon
1450031_11_a
You're talking about the kimono
rental service they used, right?
Liz
1450031_10_a
Still, I'm surprised we can get
our hands on kimonos that cheaply.
Sinon
1450031_9_a
Ugh... But thanks for the
compliment.
Sinon
1450031_8_a
Come on, Sinon! You're beautiful,
and you'll look amazing! Why d'ya
think I forced you to tag along?!
Liz
1450031_7_a
sigh
... They did look great in
those kimonos. I doubt I can wear
one so well.
Sinon
1450031_6_a
That was a CHALLENGE! We're gonna
find awesome kimonos and look so
good we'll blow them away!
Liz
1450031_5_a
Of course we are! You saw the pic
Asuna sent us of her and Alice,
right?!
Liz
1450031_4_a
I'll go at my own pace.
We're not in a rush, are we?
Sinon
1450031_3_a
Sinon
1450031_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Sinon! Over here!
Come on, hurry up!
Liz
1450031_1_a
Yuuki
1450028_20_a
Try me.
Sinon
1450028_19_a
Silica
1450028_18_a
Oh yeah? We'll see if you're still
talking a big game once we stuff
your mouths full of snow!
Liz
1450028_17_a
Ha ha, you can say that again!
Even if you do, we'll know how
to counter it!
Yuuki
1450028_16_a
But you won't be able to pull the
same stunt on us. Right, Yuuki?
Sinon
1450028_15_a
Yuuki
1450028_14_a
Heh, have it your way.
Sinon
1450028_13_a
Then we'll have all the walls
and trenches!
Liz
1450028_12_a
Hey, I know! Let's swap bases!
Liz
1450028_11_a
Argh, I'm still bitter! I lost
the snowball fight that I came
up with in the first place!
Liz
1450028_10_a
Not even a firefight prepares you
for a snowman attack, though...
Silica
1450028_9_a
Silica
1450028_8_a
Those walls and trenches...
I should've known you can't bring
snowballs to a Sinon firefight.
Liz
1450028_7_a
She's right. We made the right
call, putting that trench where
we did.
Sinon
1450028_6_a
Sinon
1450028_5_a
Hehe, we might not have won if we
hadn't taken you out, Silica!
Yuuki
1450028_4_a
Oh, okay...
Silica
1450028_3_a
Silica
1450028_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
Aw man, we lost.
Liz
1450028_1_a
Pina
1450027_21_a
AHHHHHHHH!
Silica
1450027_20_a
Oh, and everything in its path
too.
Sinon
1450027_19_a
If I had to guess, I'd say it'd
pick up more snow as it rolls...
Sinon
1450027_18_a
N-No! Don't!
Silica
1450027_17_a
Now what do you think would
happen if I just rolled it down
this trench?
Sinon
1450027_16_a
From the snowman Yuuki and I
were making a little while ago.
Sinon
1450027_15_a
Wh-What?! Where'd you get that
giant snowball from?
Silica
1450027_14_a
But what if I use this?
Sinon
1450027_13_a
Say what?
Silica
1450027_12_a
You're right. I won't be able
to hit you with a snowball.
Sinon
1450027_11_a
Chirp!
Pina
1450027_10_a
You won't be able to hit me before
I make it to you!
Silica
1450027_9_a
Don't act like you've won, Sinon.
You know I can get out of here
in a flash!
Silica
1450027_8_a
Our flag is at the end of this
trench.
Sinon
1450027_7_a
Whoa! Sinon!
Silica
1450027_6_a
There you are, Silica.
Sinon
1450027_5_a
If we just follow this trench,
we should find Sinon's flag...
Silica
1450027_4_a
Chirp!
Pina
1450027_3_a
Pina
1450027_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
Okay, Pina! We've managed
to make it pretty far!
Silica
1450027_1_a
I see what you mean.
Alright, leave the flag to me!
Yuuki
1450025_27_a
Not to mention she's got Pina,
who can alert her that you're
coming.
Sinon
1450025_26_a
You're plenty fast, but she's
tiny. She'll outmaneuver you.
Sinon
1450025_25_a
They're packed in close, too.
That puts you at a disadvantage.
Sinon
1450025_24_a
Silica's weaving her way through
all of the walls and trenches
we've made.
Sinon
1450025_23_a
Sure? I mean, I know I've got the
speed for it.
Yuuki
1450025_22_a
No, you should run around all of
this and grab Team Liz's flag.
Think you can handle that?
Sinon
1450025_21_a
Then maybe I should get out there?
Yuuki
1450025_20_a
She's pretty agile. We'll have
trouble hitting her.
Sinon
1450025_19_a
Yep.
Yuuki
1450025_18_a
Yuuki
1450025_17_a
There's Silica.
Sinon
1450025_16_a
Liz
1450025_15_a
Absolutely!
Silica
1450025_14_a
That's a great idea, Silica!
Liz
1450025_13_a
I'll make a break for it, then!
I've got speed!
Silica
1450025_12_a
Snowballs or not, we're up against
someone with unparalleled accuracy
and control at a distance!
Liz
1450025_11_a
Stay sharp, Team Liz! Team Sinon's
namesake is a seasoned archer!
Liz
1450025_9_a
Silica
1450025_10_a
They're throwing from behind that
wall! They've got us pinned!
Player A
1450025_8_a
Ungf!
Player D
1450025_7_a
Gyah!
Player C
1450025_6_a
Player D
1450025_5_a
Player C
1450025_4_a
Urf! Ptthhbtbtbt!
Player B
1450025_3_a
Player A
1450025_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
C'mon, let's take that flag right
out from under Team Sinon's nose!
Player A
1450025_1_a
That's my line!
Liz
1450023_19_a
Let's split everyone up into
teams and get throwing! Oh,
and Liz... You're going down!
Sinon
1450023_18_a
Sinon
1450023_17_a
Ha ha, looks like we're getting
a nice big group together!
Liz
1450023_16_a
Hey, we'd love to join in!
Players
1450023_15_a
Yes! Me too!
Silica
1450023_14_a
Silica
1450023_13_a
That sounds awesome!
I'm totally down for that!
Yuuki
1450023_12_a
Let's do it!
Sinon
1450023_11_a
Sounds like you're on board, then!
Let's get the others in on it!
Liz
1450023_10_a
Not to mention snowball fights are
just another form of long-range
squad-based combat.
Sinon
1450023_9_a
Yeah, you're on to something.
There aren't that many open fields
where we are in real life, either.
Sinon
1450023_8_a
We're already in Gnome territory
anyway. Why not play like they do?
Liz
1450023_7_a
Oh. Yeah, now I get it. Heh.
Sinon
1450023_6_a
I figured we should work with what
we have! The wall won't stop
bullets, but it'll stop snow!
Liz
1450023_5_a
Hey, whoa! Why'd you throw a
snowball at me?
Sinon
1450023_4_a
Agh!
Sinon
1450023_3_a
Sinon
1450023_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
Pack it down like so...
And then... Hmph!
Liz
1450023_1_a
Hm?
Sinon
1450021_16_a
Oh yeah...
Wait, I know! Just do this!
Liz
1450021_15_a
Ha ha! Okay, Liz, now show me how
that soft snow is supposed to stop
a bullet.
Sinon
1450021_14_a
Like this!
See? There's your snow wall!
Liz
1450021_13_a
Say what?
Sinon
1450021_12_a
So make them yourself!
Liz
1450021_11_a
There isn't even a change in
elevation. They could've at least
put in some walls or trenches.
Sinon
1450021_10_a
Well, I can't argue about the
lack of cover.
Liz
1450021_9_a
Heh, you've got it.
Sinon
1450021_8_a
Ah, I see what you mean.
You're evaluating this map
like a GGO player would.
Liz
1450021_7_a
You'd be a sitting duck, which
doesn't make for great firefights.
Sinon
1450021_6_a
Ah, sorry. I was just thinking
about how little cover there
is out here.
Sinon
1450021_5_a
What do you mean "stick out like
a sore thumb?"
Liz
1450021_4_a
You can't help but stick out like
a sore thumb when you're in a
giant snow-covered plain.
Sinon
1450021_3_a
Liz
1450021_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_christmas
Still, it's nothing but snow and
ice out here...
Sinon
1450021_1_a
Yeah! Now let's use it to go out
there and kick some monster tail!
Leafa
1450018_17_a
Hehe... Looks like we've mastered
a whole new type of skill, huh?
Sinon
1450018_16_a
Ahh, that makes sense.
Leafa
1450018_15_a
Yeah, I used my normal arrow for
that shot, so it was much easier.
Sinon
1450018_14_a
but you pulled it off like it was
nothing.
Leafa
1450018_13_a
I'm seriously impressed. I thought
you might have trouble with the
second shot too,
Leafa
1450018_12_a
I believe I did. Thanks for all
the help, Leafa. I really
appreciate it.
Sinon
1450018_11_a
Sinon! You did it!
Leafa
1450018_10_a
Grrraaakkkkkk!!
Monster
1450018_9_a
And now I time my second arrow
with your attack... Now!
Sinon
1450018_8_a
You did it!! So now it's my turn!
Hiiiiiiya!!
Leafa
1450018_7_a
I did it...
Sinon
1450018_6_a
Grrkrkrk?!
Monster
1450018_5_a
Sssh!
Sinon
1450018_4_a
Leafa
1450018_3_a
Sinon
1450018_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
Graaawr!!
Monster
1450018_1_a
Maybe. I'm feeling a little more
confident, at least. Let's give it
a shot.
Sinon
1450017_30_a
It totally is! I bet you'll be
able to parry with an arrow
easy now!
Leafa
1450017_29_a
Heh heh heh... It's nothing that
impressive.
Sinon
1450017_28_a
That's...AMAZING!! You're like
some super-powered ninja master!
You can see with your mind's eye!
Leafa
1450017_27_a
Yes, that's right. One of the
benefits of my training to
improve my senses here.
Sinon
1450017_26_a
S-Sinon! You just took out that
monster...without even opening
your eyes!
Leafa
1450017_25_a
Oh, hello Leafa. I didn't
notice you were there.
Sinon
1450017_24_a
Whoa! There was a boar monster
hiding in that bush?!
Leafa
1450017_23_a
Grrooonk?!
???
1450017_22_a
Huh?! What are you shooting at?
Leafa
1450017_21_a
...There!
Sinon
1450017_20_a
Sinon? What is it...?
Leafa
1450017_19_a
Sssh!
Sinon
1450017_18_a
Sinon
1450017_17_a
Sinon...
Leafa
1450017_16_a
If I can feel those things too,
then maybe I'll be able to sense
my enemy's movements as well.
Sinon
1450017_15_a
Subtle movements, the smell of
the air, the feel of the wind...
Sinon
1450017_14_a
Kirito said something to me once.
He can sense things here that
weren't programmed into the game.
Sinon
1450017_13_a
Is that even possible?
Leafa
1450017_12_a
So that's what I'm going to try
to do.
Sinon
1450017_11_a
Without a sword prediction system,
my only option is to picture where
the attack will go.
Sinon
1450017_10_a
But Kirito... He showed me that
it's possible to go one step
beyond. To predict predictions.
Sinon
1450017_9_a
Being that accurate with an
extra heavy arrow... Well,
it seems impossible.
Sinon
1450017_8_a
The only way to parry an attack
with an arrow is to anticipate and
hit the enemy weapon as it moves.
Sinon
1450017_7_a
Sinon
1450017_6_a
Sinon...
Leafa
1450017_5_a
Oops, she's focusing...
I should leave her be...
Leafa
1450017_4_a
Hey! Sinon!
Leafa
1450017_3_a
Oh, there you are!
Leafa
1450017_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
...
Sinon
1450017_1_a
But it'll be even harder to
pull off...
Sinon
1450015_25_a
We do?!
Leafa
1450015_24_a
No, we still have one left.
Sinon
1450015_23_a
So...are we out of options?
Leafa
1450015_22_a
Honestly, I'm starting to have
second thoughts.
Sinon
1450015_21_a
Even if we can pull this off
against Kirito, what's the point
if we can't use it normally?
Sinon
1450015_20_a
Yeah...
Leafa
1450015_19_a
We shouldn't be counting on our
target to try to block my arrow
with its weapon.
Sinon
1450015_18_a
He is...
But I don't like it.
Sinon
1450015_17_a
Oh, I have an idea! Let's ask
Kirito to be our training dummy.
He's fast enough.
Leafa
1450015_16_a
Hmm...
Sinon
1450015_15_a
I'd be terrified if trash mobs
here could dodge arrows. But
we can't practice like this...
Leafa
1450015_14_a
Normally, nothing's fast enough to
even see an arrow, much less guard
against it...
Sinon
1450015_13_a
Yeah, I suppose so. I don't know
why I expected it to pull a Kirito
and ninja-dodge or something.
Sinon
1450015_12_a
Ahaha, well, I guess that's what
normally happens when you shoot
something in the head.
Leafa
1450015_11_a
Lame...
Sinon
1450015_10_a
Huh? It died before it even had
a chance to swing...
Leafa
1450015_9_a
Grrk?!
Monster
1450015_8_a
Now!
Sinon
1450015_7_a
Got it. Let's give this a shot.
Sinon
1450015_6_a
It's got a sword, so it's perfect
for testing your arrow parry!
Leafa
1450015_5_a
Sinon! A monster just spawned!
Leafa
1450015_4_a
Sinon
1450015_3_a
Leafa
1450015_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Grrr...
Monster
1450015_1_a
Heh, neither can I.
Sinon
1450013_18_a
For this? You bet I do! I can't
wait to see you pull it off!
Leafa
1450013_17_a
Of course. You have some time?
Sinon
1450013_16_a
Want to go test it out?
Leafa
1450013_15_a
Exactly. At the very least, this
arrow is the best chance I have
with ALO's selection.
Sinon
1450013_14_a
An arrow this heavy has a much
better chance of knocking an
enemy's weapon aside!
Leafa
1450013_13_a
Huh, what are you talking about?
Oh, wait! Arrow parry!
Leafa
1450013_12_a
Yeah, but the extra weight might
just make all the difference.
Sinon
1450013_11_a
I can see why. An arrow this heavy
must be really hard to shoot...
Leafa
1450013_10_a
Heh, and now you know why no one
uses them.
Sinon
1450013_9_a
It's way heavier than a rapier!
How can an arrow be this heavy?!
Leafa
1450013_8_a
Okay, but wh-AH! Wh-Whoa,
this is HEAVY!!
Leafa
1450013_7_a
Here, hold out your hand.
Sinon
1450013_6_a
Really? Why's that?
Leafa
1450013_5_a
Nope, they've been around forever.
They're just not too well-known
because barely anyone uses them.
Sinon
1450013_4_a
An arrow? Hmm... I've never seen
one like this before. Is it a new
item?
Leafa
1450013_3_a
Leafa
1450013_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Leafa, take a quick look at this.
Sinon
1450013_1_a
Hmm...
Sinon
1450011_19_a
Y-Yeah, when you put it like that,
it does sound kinda impossible...
Leafa
1450011_18_a
Kirito did something similar in
GGO, but it was literally cutting
bullets in half in midair.
Sinon
1450011_17_a
Yeah, I suppose so. Arrows and
other ranged weapons lack the
weight and power of melee weapons.
Leafa
1450011_16_a
Arrows are much lighter than most
melee weapons, so it's likely I
won't be able to stop a blade.
Sinon
1450011_15_a
I...don't know. I've never even
considered it before.
Sinon
1450011_14_a
Yeah, that about sums it up.
So, can you do it?
Leafa
1450011_13_a
Hold up. You're saying you want me
to take the lead. In other words,
parry...with an arrow?
Sinon
1450011_12_a
And then you hit with a second
arrow right as my sword connects.
So...sound good?
Leafa
1450011_11_a
Yeah. You hit with an arrow first,
then I follow with my sword...
Leafa
1450011_10_a
You want me to be the main for
this one?
Sinon
1450011_9_a
You're...not serious, are you?
Sinon
1450011_8_a
I'm wondering. We got it with me
taking the lead, but what about
the other way around?
Leafa
1450011_7_a
Yes?
Sinon
1450011_6_a
Hehe, thanks!
But actually...
Leafa
1450011_5_a
You don't owe me a thing. Your
hard work made it happen. Besides,
I like partnering with you.
Sinon
1450011_4_a
I owe you big time for helping me
master that new technique.
Leafa
1450011_3_a
Sinon
1450011_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Hey Sinon! Thanks so much
for everything.
Leafa
1450011_1_a
I thought she might need some
cheering up, but it looks like
I was worried over nothing.
Leafa
1440138_39_a
Strea
1440138_38_a
Ahaha... I heard all this rain had
Sakuya down in the dumps...
Leafa
1440138_37_a
First, we play shogi!
Let the games begin!
Sakuya
1440138_36_a
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Recon
1440138_35_a
Recon
1440138_34_a
Good! Quickly now, preparations!
Recon, run! Fetch us tea, boy!
Sakuya
1440138_33_a
Leafa
1440138_32_a
Cool! Sure, I'd love to!
Strea
1440138_31_a
Strea! I challenge you to battle
once more, here and now!
Sakuya
1440138_30_a
Recon
1440138_29_a
Grrr... You may have bested me
once, but it shall not happen
again!
Sakuya
1440138_28_a
When I was playing you, I thought
for sure my brain was about to
overload!
Strea
1440138_27_a
Leafa
1440138_26_a
Yup, that's totally me!
But Yakusa-I mean, Sakuya-
you're pretty good!
Strea
1440138_25_a
If you know that name,
then it really is you...
Narcissistic Lettuce...
Sakuya
1440138_24_a
Sakuya
1440138_23_a
Yakusa? That is your account
name for those online matches,
right, Sakuya?
Recon
1440138_22_a
Leafa
1440138_21_a
Oh! So you must be that Yakusa
person I just played!
Strea
1440138_20_a
Recon
1440138_19_a
What?!
Sakuya
1440138_18_a
Hey, that's me!
Strea
1440138_17_a
Strea
1440138_16_a
Umm... Narcissistic...Lettuce?
Leafa
1440138_15_a
Recon
1440138_14_a
I was, until yesterday. But from
the shadows stepped one who cast
me down-Narcissistic Lettuce.
Sakuya
1440138_13_a
Strea
1440138_12_a
What?! Sakuya lost?!
Wasn't she supposed
to be unbeatable?!
Leafa
1440138_11_a
Sakuya just lost three matches
in a row, and she's pretty sore
about it.
Recon
1440138_10_a
Sakuya
1440138_9_a
Well, Leafa, the thing is...
Recon
1440138_8_a
Strea
1440138_7_a
Is everything all right, Sakuya?
You seem down.
Leafa
1440138_6_a
Recon
1440138_5_a
Strea, is it? Glad to meet you.
Please, make yourself at home.
Sakuya
1440138_4_a
Hi there! My name's Strea.
I'm a Gnome!
Strea
1440138_3_a
Strea
1440138_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
Hey Sakuya! I'm here to introduce
one of our friends.
Leafa
1440138_1_a
Understood. You may show them in.
Sakuya
1440137_24_a
Leafa's here? If she's brought
a friend, maybe it's Kirito?
Recon
1440137_23_a
Leafa the Sylph swordmaster,
and one in her company.
???
1440137_22_a
Understood. Who is it?
Sakuya
1440137_21_a
Excuse me, Lady Sakuya.
You have a visitor.
???
1440137_20_a
I cannot forget that a warrior
must always seek greater skill
and knowledge.
Sakuya
1440137_19_a
A wise thing to remember.
Perhaps my victories caused
me to grow complacent.
Sakuya
1440137_18_a
I suppose it's true what they say.
No matter how good you are,
there's always someone better.
Recon
1440137_17_a
W-Wow...
That's a...unique name...
Recon
1440137_16_a
I shall never forget the account
name of the one who bested me...
Curse you, Narcissistic Lettuce!
Sakuya
1440137_15_a
Nevertheless, it's true.
And by the same foe thrice
in quick succession...
Sakuya
1440137_14_a
YOU did? Sakuya, the Unbeatable?!
N-No way, that's impossible!
Recon
1440137_13_a
That...is correct...
Sakuya
1440137_12_a
W-Wait, you mean...
You lost to the same person
in three different games?
Recon
1440137_11_a
And what's worse, my opponent's
account was the same in each
match.
Sakuya
1440137_10_a
No way... YOU lost?!
Recon
1440137_9_a
And as of several moments ago...
I was defeated in all of them.
Sakuya
1440137_8_a
I was competing in Go, chess,
and shogi matches online...
Sakuya
1440137_7_a
What?! Why?!
Recon
1440137_6_a
Recon... I have never been this
aggravated before in my entire
life.
Sakuya
1440137_5_a
Sakuya
1440137_4_a
S-Sakuya?
What's wrong?
Recon
1440137_3_a
No! How could this have happened?!
Sakuya
1440137_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
GRRAAARGH!
Sakuya
1440137_1_a
Umm, Leafa? What did you
say that girl was...?
Recon
1440135_26_a
...
Recon
1440135_25_a
Hehe! Exactly! Wow, all of these
games sound like fun! I'm going
to give it a shot!
Strea
1440135_24_a
Your brain's processing speed is
like a gajillion times faster than
any human's.
Leafa
1440135_23_a
Hahaha... Oh yeah, I almost
forgot. You are a super-advanced
AI.
Leafa
1440135_22_a
No way! Seriously?!
Recon
1440135_21_a
Annnd finished! I just accessed
a bunch of sites and learned all
the rules!
Strea
1440135_20_a
Strea...?
Leafa
1440135_19_a
...
Strea
1440135_18_a
A lot of board games are really
complicated, so they're kinda
hard to learn...
Leafa
1440135_17_a
I want to learn more about how
humans enjoy themselves. It's my
duty as a former MHCP!
Strea
1440135_16_a
Nope, can't say I have!
But I'd like to try!
Strea
1440135_15_a
Have you ever played one, Strea?
Leafa
1440135_14_a
Board games? Oh yeah, real
world games where there are
pieces and stuff, right?
Strea
1440135_13_a
Apparently, she's basically
invincible too...
Leafa
1440135_12_a
A friend of mine's been totally
obsessed with online board games
recently.
Leafa
1440135_11_a
Oh, hey Strea.
Leafa
1440135_10_a
Recon
1440135_9_a
Leafa
1440135_8_a
What's up, Leafa?
Strea
1440135_7_a
Sakuya does seem like the kind
of person that'd be killer at
stuff like that...
Leafa
1440135_6_a
Everyone's talking about how she's
dominating the board game world.
Recon
1440135_5_a
She was moaning about being
rusty at first, but she hasn't
lost a game for a while now...
Recon
1440135_4_a
Yeah. Sakuya's been locked up in
the Sylph palace playing Go and
shogi nonstop for days...
Recon
1440135_3_a
Recon
1440135_2_a
bg_s2_20_restaurant
Wow, really?
Leafa
1440135_1_a
Sakuya... You're starting to
frighten me... Hah. Hah...
Recon
1440133_11_a
Anyway, I might as well give it
another try. Heh heh heh...
This will be fun.
Sakuya
1440133_10_a
W-Wow... I'm kind of in awe of
you right now...
Recon
1440133_9_a
I haven't played much since
I started VRMMOs though.
Sakuya
1440133_8_a
Yes, and one of those times I was
hailed as the unbeatable queen of
online board gaming.
Sakuya
1440133_7_a
Huh? Didn't you just say you only
played "from time to time"?
Recon
1440133_6_a
Interesting... Maybe I should join
the party. But I wonder if anyone
can match my skills...
Sakuya
1440133_5_a
Well, I hear that everyone's
playing online board games right
now. Maybe because of the rain?
Recon
1440133_4_a
Board games? I do enjoy a bit of
Go or shogi from time to time...
Sakuya
1440133_3_a
Sakuya
1440133_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
Hey Sakuya, do you play board
games?
Recon
1440133_1_a
Ha ha, no, you may not.
Sakuya
1440131_16_a
Could I have more details...?
Recon
1440131_15_a
I usually don't discuss that world
here-but suffice it to say my
duties there are...simple.
Sakuya
1440131_14_a
Wow, Sakuya, you must have no
life-er, I mean do you have a
lot of free time?
Recon
1440131_13_a
But there would be one, far worse
consequence to deal with... Heh,
I'd be bored out of my mind.
Sakuya
1440131_12_a
Yeah, it'll be a mess...
Recon
1440131_11_a
The next leader summit will have
to get pushed back as well...
Sakuya
1440131_10_a
Yes, we just might. But if we do,
it'll put a wrench in all of our
other upcoming plans.
Sakuya
1440131_9_a
I guess we'll have to put it
off for now.
Recon
1440131_8_a
Yeah, and we had that outdoor
exploration quest planned this
week too...
Recon
1440131_7_a
Of course I am. Rain in the real
world, rain in ALO-there's no
escaping it.
Sakuya
1440131_6_a
Sakuya
1440131_5_a
You seem down, Sakuya.
Recon
1440131_4_a
When will this infernal rain
finally stop?
Sakuya
1440131_3_a
sigh
...
Really, now...
Sakuya
1440131_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
...
Sakuya
1440131_1_a
Ha ha! You got it.
Sinon
1440128_22_a
I kiiiiiinda want to put that
particular episode behind me.
Girl
1440128_21_a
Ha ha! Go ahead! Just don't think
about me losing in that event,
okay?
Girl
1440128_20_a
Maybe that will help me get
in touch with that same fiery
feminine spirit of yours.
Sinon
1440128_19_a
Whenever I equip this outfit,
I promise I'll think of you.
Sinon
1440128_18_a
Hehe! I'm glad to hear it.
Sinon
1440128_17_a
I should be thanking you too!
This chat really put my mind
at ease. I feel so much better!
Girl
1440128_16_a
Really?
Then you're welcome!
Girl
1440128_15_a
Thanks... I feel like I learned
a bit from talking to you.
Sinon
1440128_14_a
...
Sinon
1440128_13_a
It's a game world, after all!
There's always something wonderful
waiting to turn your mood around!
Girl
1440128_12_a
Funny, isn't it? In a world like
this, those painful feelings fade
away before long.
Girl
1440128_11_a
If this were real life,
I wouldn't want to see
her face ever again.
Girl
1440128_10_a
Honestly, it did upset me. But
we're getting along well now!
At least on the surface, hehe...
Girl
1440128_9_a
That must've been painful...
And did it give you any
kind of envy or ill will?
Sinon
1440128_8_a
Yeah. A guildmate of mine
from ages ago.
Girl
1440128_7_a
Was she a friend of yours?
Sinon
1440128_6_a
When you told me you
lost to a challenger...
Sinon
1440128_5_a
...
Sinon
1440128_4_a
Anything I can do for ya?
Girl
1440128_3_a
Oh, it's you again...
What's up?
Girl
1440128_2_a
bg_18_tower_road_sunset
...Um, hi.
Sinon
1440128_1_a
Thanks, you guys!
Sinon

Silica
1440127_21_a
If you can't find her,
we'll help too!
Liz
1440127_20_a
Okay!
Good luck, Sinon!
Silica
1440127_19_a
I'll see you two later!
Sinon
1440127_18_a
You're right. I think I'll go find
that girl and talk to her.
Sinon
1440127_17_a
Liz...
Sinon
1440127_16_a
Hehehe!
Liz
1440127_15_a
How can I put it...? I feel like
I can understand where she's
coming from.
Liz
1440127_14_a
Heartbreak hurts, obviously, but
it doesn't need to turn you into
a curse-spewing rage monster.
Liz
1440127_13_a
Just because the girl was upset
doesn't mean she had any ill will.
Liz
1440127_12_a
What do you mean, Liz?
Sinon
1440127_11_a
You think so? I don't see it
that way, Sinon.
Liz
1440127_10_a
Y-You mean like a curse?!
That's creepy!
Silica
1440127_9_a
All the rage and pain behind it
makes me feel like it's got the
evil eye on it...
Sinon
1440127_8_a
It's like I said to the girl
who gave it to me.
Sinon
1440127_7_a
But I don't know if
I really want to equip it...
Sinon
1440127_6_a
Oh my gosh, this is really rare!
I'm so jealous!
Silica
1440127_5_a
Uh, yeah...
Sinon
1440127_4_a
Silica
1440127_3_a
Sinon
1440127_2_a
bg_18_tower_top
What? You just got a wedding
dress for free?!
Liz
1440127_1_a
So here you go! Strut around in
that and make all your friends
jealous!
Girl
1440125_18_a
Y-Yeah, maybe some do, but-
Sinon
1440125_17_a
Every girl wants to wear this
outfit someday, right?
Girl
1440125_16_a
Hehe! Aw, c'mon!
Don't look so shocked!
Girl
1440125_15_a
Wh-What? Really?
Sinon
1440125_14_a
In the end, it doesn't really
matter... But if you want these
clothes, you can have 'em.
Girl
1440125_13_a
M-Maybe you've got a point...
Sinon
1440125_12_a
...!
Sinon
1440125_11_a
You must've had some kind of
wish that you wanted granted...
Girl
1440125_10_a
But you wouldn't go sabotaging
your friends' love lives just for
something like that, would you?
Girl
1440125_9_a
But that's mainly because I heard
a rare item was going to be
awarded in the next quest.
Sinon
1440125_8_a
Huh? Y-Yeah, I guess...
Sinon
1440125_7_a
That still doesn't change the fact
that you competed to have a
wedding with your friend, though.
Girl
1440125_6_a
I lost in the wedding battle
event too, but it didn't bother
me at all...
Sinon
1440125_5_a
Ermn?
Uh, no, I'm not? Like, at all?
Sinon
1440125_4_a
But y'know what? I think
you're a lot like me!
Girl
1440125_3_a
It... It doesn't bother me that
much, though...
Sinon
1440125_2_a
Sinon
1440125_1_a_1
bg_18_tower_road
I see... It sounds like you've
sure got a lot on your mind, huh?
Girl
1440125_1_a
Sorry!
I didn't mean it in a bad way.
Sinon
1440123_32_a
H-Hey! Are you making fun of me?
Girl
1440123_31_a
It's kind of cute how you feel
your emotions so strongly.
Sinon
1440123_30_a
Huh?
Girl
1440123_29_a
...You're pretty feminine,
aren't you?
Sinon
1440123_28_a
...
Sinon
1440123_27_a
It'll just remind me of this and
put me in a terrible mood all
over again!
Girl
1440123_26_a
Even if I could reuse them,
I wouldn't want to.
Girl
1440123_25_a
The equipment might come in handy
for another quest somewhere down
the line.
Sinon
1440123_24_a
A-Ah, I see what you mean...
But still, you don't need to
throw it away.
Sinon
1440123_23_a
That's why I'm so annoyed!
Girl
1440123_22_a
I lost to a challenger, and now
I'll never get a chance!
Girl
1440123_21_a
Yeah... I was planning to wear it
specially for the wedding event,
but...
Girl
1440123_20_a
...!
It's...a wedding dress?
Sinon
1440123_19_a
See for yourself.
Girl
1440123_18_a
Wh-What are you talking about?
Are they cursed items?
Sinon
1440123_17_a
Just having this stuff around
makes my stomach churn!
Girl
1440123_16_a
No, I don't wanna
do that either...
Girl
1440123_15_a
If they're rare items, why not
hang onto them and sell them
to another player?
Sinon
1440123_14_a
It'd be such a waste to throw
away all that equipment in a rage.
Sinon
1440123_13_a
Oh, r-right...
Guess I was.
Sorry about that.
Girl
1440123_12_a
Hey, I'm not the one
yelling to herself in public.
Sinon
1440123_11_a
H-Hey! What are you
gawking at, weirdo?
Girl
1440123_10_a
...
Sinon
1440123_9_a
I'm gonna throw away
this whole stupid outfit!
Girl
1440123_8_a
Huh?
Sinon
1440123_7_a
Aww, man!
This is so annoying!
???
1440123_6_a
my head around the whole
concept of "girliness"...
Sinon
1440123_5_a
Maybe I should read some
romance comics to get
Sinon
1440123_4_a
I'm still not getting it.
Sinon
1440123_3_a
I'm really happy that Silica and
Liz would say that, but...
Sinon
1440123_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
...
Sinon
1440123_1_a
Err, no thanks!
I think I'll pass...
Sinon
1440121_26_a
Don't worry, Sinon! We'll help
bring out your feminine side!
Silica
1440121_25_a
Yeah...
Sinon
1440121_24_a
I know what you mean, though.
This world is still like another
separate reality for us, after all.
Liz
1440121_23_a
Ah... Right... Good point...
Sinon
1440121_22_a
Hehe! It's not meant to be
realistic, Sinon! This is a
virtual world.
Liz
1440121_21_a
Maybe that's why the whole
wedding event theme feels
unrealistic to me...
Sinon
1440121_20_a
That game had a lot of international
players and monetary deals, so the
stakes felt really high.
Sinon
1440121_19_a
Ah, I see what you mean...
Silica
1440121_18_a
And they didn't have these kinds
of light-hearted seasonal events
like ALO does...
Sinon
1440121_17_a
That's a first-person shooter,
so I never got to meet many
other girls...
Sinon
1440121_16_a
And the only VRMMO I played
before this was GGO.
Sinon
1440121_15_a
Back in the real world, all I used
to do in my free time was read...
Sinon
1440121_14_a
What?
Liz
1440121_13_a
No offense, but...I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Sinon
1440121_12_a
It's just the three of us here,
so this is officially a girl-talk
zone.
Liz
1440121_11_a
Yeah, no need for the
tough-girl act.

1440121_10_a
Whaaat? But you're a girl! Isn't
it your dream to get married
someday?
Silica
1440121_9_a
It's just...I'm not really that
interested in brides and
weddings and so on.
Sinon
1440121_8_a
N-No, that's not what I meant!
Sinon
1440121_7_a
What? Like, we could never beat
Asuna when it comes to her
feelings for Kirito or something?
Liz
1440121_6_a
Honestly, I'm not surprised...
Sinon
1440121_5_a
You said it. Asuna seriously
would not let up!
Silica
1440121_4_a
Sinon
1440121_3_a
Silica
1440121_2_a
bg_18_tower_top
sigh
... That wedding battle
sure was a tough one...
Liz
1440121_1_a
Heh... Well, Strea's Strea.
Besides, did you see that glint in
her eye? I give up, she wins.
Philia
1440118_33_a
Hah, I never thought revealing the
truth would only make her even
more insistent.
Kirito
1440118_32_a
Yay, woohoo!
Strea
1440118_31_a
B-But... Oh, you know what,
forget it! Fine! Just do whatever
you want, Strea.
Philia
1440118_30_a
I'll design it myself! I guarantee
it'll look fantastic!
Strea
1440118_29_a
You are going to look SO cute and
I'm not stopping until you wear
one!
Strea
1440118_28_a
Huh?! B-But
Philia
1440118_27_a
Just forget them! This is the
perfect way to blow off real world
stress! Wear it and wear it proud!
Strea
1440118_26_a
Well, yeah... But I have really
bad memories associated with
sailor uniforms now...
Philia
1440118_25_a
But you have black hair here, so
you won't get called names 'cause
you're wearing a sailor uniform!
Strea
1440118_24_a
And it is SO RUDE!! Gah! I'm
furious just thinking about it!
Philia
1440118_23_a
It means "a female gang member."
Basically, they're calling Philia
a bad person because of her hair.
Kirito
1440118_22_a
Yeah. I don't think too many people
use that term anymore.
Kirito
1440118_21_a
Gangsta girl?
Strea
1440118_20_a
Yeah... Ugh, I can't believe you
even got that one.
Philia
1440118_19_a
Like "gangsta girl"?
Kirito
1440118_18_a
I get called all sorts of names
by the other students.
Philia
1440118_17_a
It makes me really stand out at
school, especially with the sailor
uniform.
Philia
1440118_16_a
My real hair's a pretty unusual
color, right?
Philia
1440118_15_a
Well, there's no sense hiding it
anymore.
Philia
1440118_14_a
Philia...
Strea
1440118_13_a
Yeah. At least, I think I have
a good idea.
Kirito
1440118_12_a
You know the real reason why
I don't like wearing a sailor
uniform in the real world...
Philia
1440118_11_a
But, Kirito, you figured it out,
didn't you?
Philia
1440118_10_a
Fiiine.
Strea
1440118_9_a
So, Strea, no trying to stuff
Philia into a sailor uniform
anymore, okay?
Kirito
1440118_8_a
sigh
I guess the cat's out of
the bag, huh? The truth is...
Philia
1440118_7_a
Really, Philia?! What a waste!
You'd look so cute in one!
Strea
1440118_6_a
W-Well...
Philia
1440118_5_a
That's why she wasn't thrilled
when we asked her to wear one here
too.
Kirito
1440118_4_a
Strea
1440118_3_a
Philia
1440118_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Well, I figured that Philia didn't
like sailor uniforms because she
had to wear them for school.
Kirito
1440118_1_a
Huh? Huh?! Who's talking about
what now?!
Philia
1440117_27_a
Oh, yeah.
Strea
1440117_26_a
Strea, remember our chat a few
minutes ago about why Philia
didn't like sailor uniforms?
Kirito
1440117_25_a
N-N-NO! I did NOT stalk her!
Kirito
1440117_24_a
Wow, Kirito! You went and
stalked her to find that out, huh?
Strea
1440117_23_a
What?! H-How did you know?!
Philia
1440117_22_a
Philia... Your school makes you
wear a sailor uniform, right?
Kirito
1440117_21_a
Huh? Wh-Why do you want to talk
about that all of a sudden?
Philia
1440117_20_a
Strea
1440117_19_a
Philia, do you mind if we talk
about real life for a minute?
Kirito
1440117_18_a
Ahaha, right...
Well...
Ahem...
Kirito
1440117_17_a
Yeah! That works!
Strea
1440117_16_a
A blue funk...
Oh, you mean like, gloomy?
Philia
1440117_15_a
Yeah! Isn't that the right phrase
for this sorta situation?
Strea
1440117_14_a
B-Blue funk?!
Kirito
1440117_13_a
Kirito, Philia... Why are you two
in such a blue funk?
Strea
1440117_12_a
Yeah...
Philia
1440117_11_a
We didn't really talk about real
life back then... I guess it's too
late now, huh?
Kirito
1440117_10_a
When they heard that you and Asuna
would be going there too, they
insisted I go to a normal school.
Philia
1440117_9_a
Yeah. I wanted to, but my parents
wouldn't let me.
Philia
1440117_8_a
You don't go to the Survivors'
School, right?
Kirito
1440117_7_a
Oh, er... I...had something
to do at school.
Philia
1440117_6_a
Hey, Philia! What kept you
so long?
Strea
1440117_5_a
Hey.
Kirito
1440117_4_a
Strea
1440117_3_a
Kirito
1440117_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Sorry to keep you waiting, guys!
Philia
1440117_1_a
Got what...?
Strea
1440115_24_a
Hmm...
I think I got it.
Kirito
1440115_23_a
Kirito?
Is something wrong?
Strea
1440115_22_a
...
Kirito
1440115_21_a
Oh...
I guess, yeah...
Strea
1440115_20_a
Which means that Philia's real
hair color is brownish-blond.
Kirito
1440115_19_a
At the start of SAO, everyone's
avatar was forcibly changed to
resemble their real world selves.
Kirito
1440115_18_a
Huh...? Ahh! You're right!
Strea
1440115_17_a
But back in SAO, her hair was way
closer to blonde than black!
Kirito
1440115_16_a
Hold up, Strea. Yeah, Philia is a
Spriggan here in ALO, so she's
got black hair...
Kirito
1440115_15_a
The only one of us who actually
has black hair there is Leafa,
right?!
Strea
1440115_14_a
Yeah! Asuna, Liz, and Silica don't
have black hair in the real world.
Strea
1440115_13_a
Black...hair?
Kirito
1440115_12_a
Philia's got black hair! She's
perfect! It's like that outfit
was made for her!
Strea
1440115_11_a
I mean, sailor uniforms are made
for Japanese high school girls,
right?
Strea
1440115_10_a
But Kirito! I just know Philia
would look amazing in it!
Strea
1440115_9_a
Hold your horses there, Strea.
Let's not drag anything out of
anybody if they don't want us to.
Kirito
1440115_8_a
Yeah. We'll drag the truth out of
her today for sure!
Strea
1440115_7_a
She started acting reaaally weird
the second we brought up her
wearing a sailor uniform.
Kirito
1440115_6_a
Right... We'll pick up where we
left off.
Kirito
1440115_5_a
We're meeting up with Philia after
this, right? Let's ask her about
the sailor uniform again!
Strea
1440115_4_a
What's up?
Kirito
1440115_3_a
Kirito
1440115_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Hey-hey! Kirito!
Strea
1440115_1_a
Indeed... What's she hiding?
Kirito
1440113_25_a
Kirito
1440113_24_a
Veeery suspicious.
Strea
1440113_23_a
...
Kirito
1440113_22_a
Logging out now, bye, 'kay,
thanks, see you later!!
Philia
1440113_21_a
I'm n-not hiding anything! Er,
almost forgot! I have something
to do in the real world!
Philia
1440113_20_a
Yes, you certainly are!
You're hiding something,
aren't you? Come on, spill it!
Strea
1440113_19_a
N-N-No, I'm not!!
Philia
1440113_18_a
You're acting real suspicious all
of a sudden...
Kirito
1440113_17_a
Philia?
Is something wrong?
Kirito
1440113_16_a
W-Well...
Umm...
No! I refuse!!
Philia
1440113_15_a
Why? I think you'd look great
in one!
Strea
1440113_14_a
N-No way...
I hate sailor uniforms...
Philia
1440113_13_a
Huh?
Philia
1440113_12_a
Kirito
1440113_11_a
Philia, why not just put it on?
Join the sailor side!
Strea
1440113_10_a
Philia... I feel for you.
Kirito
1440113_9_a
Whaaat?! Aww, I'm going to
miss it!
Strea
1440113_8_a
So I officially disbanded it!
No more guild!
Philia
1440113_7_a
Then they started begging me
their hands and knees!
to wear
one while I trained them.
Philia
1440113_6_a
They started talking about how I'd
look in a sailor uniform.
Philia
1440113_5_a
Ugh, I don't even want to talk
about it.
Philia
1440113_4_a
Strea
1440113_3_a
Philia
1440113_2_a
bg_21_alne
So, what ever happened to the
"Strea Fan Club/Punish Me, Philia!"
guild members?
Kirito
1440113_1_a
Hahaha.
Kirito
1440111_24_a
Hehehe... Oh yeah, I forgot about
that. My bad, Philia!
Strea
1440111_23_a
And then you made ME deal with
them while you ran off!
Philia
1440111_22_a
It's all your fault, too! You had
to go and gather that crowd of
idiots!
Philia
1440111_21_a
That's mean, Strea! Besides,
I asked you to make them stop!
Philia
1440111_20_a
I'd say the way you drilled them
wasn't scary
it was terrifying!
Strea
1440111_19_a
I'm not that scary, am I?
Philia
1440111_18_a
but they all started hailing me as
"Queen Philia of the Amazons" and
demanding I whip them into shape.
Philia
1440111_17_a
Ugh, don't even remind me.
I just wanted to teach them some
PvP basics,
Philia
1440111_16_a
Heh, come to think of it...
Didn't the object of the guild's
adoration switch pretty quick?
Kirito
1440111_15_a
Philia ended up as the guild
leader, too.
Strea
1440111_14_a
Philia
1440111_13_a
Kirito
1440111_12_a
Hey, I didn't make the guild!
But still, hehe, that was fun!
Strea
1440111_11_a
You had that guild for people who
wanted to worship you in your
sailory-uniformy glory.
Kirito
1440111_10_a
I still can't believe what
happened with that the other day.
Kirito
1440111_9_a
Ah ha ha, Strea, you are totally
obsessed with that sailor outfit.
Philia
1440111_8_a
My sailor uniform is way cuter!
Strea
1440111_7_a
I hate to be a party pooper,
but that piece of equipment
just isn't that cute.
Strea
1440111_6_a
I know, right?
Philia
1440111_5_a
Congrats, Philia.
That's a nice rare item.
Kirito
1440111_4_a
Strea
1440111_3_a
Kirito
1440111_2_a
bg_21_alne
Treasure, treasure, la la la!
Philia
1440111_1_a
But I'll head back here
when I need to unwind, ha ha!
Sinon
1440108_21_a
Asuna
1440108_20_a
Yeah... I've got another shift.
Sinon
1440108_19_a
Huh? You're going already?
Asuna
1440108_18_a
Well, I'll see you later.
Sinon
1440108_17_a
That sudden quest helped me
let off some steam.
Sinon
1440108_16_a
Hehe! It was all
thanks to you, Asuna.
Sinon
1440108_15_a
Ha ha... Sounds like you got to work
out some aggression after all!
Asuna
1440108_14_a
I should be thanking you
for letting me kick his butt!
Sinon
1440108_13_a
After all, even in a position of
power, there are some things that
you just don't do...
Sinon
1440108_12_a
Don't mention it! I really can't
stand guys like that.
Sinon
1440108_11_a
I really can't
thank you enough!
Rescued Maid
1440108_10_a
Not just for saving me back there,
but also for helping me find a
new place to work.
Rescued Maid
1440108_9_a
Asuna
1440108_8_a
Sinon
1440108_7_a
Miss Sinon...
Thank you ever so much.
Rescued Maid
1440108_6_a
Sinon
1440108_5_a
Not at all. We had just been
thinking of hiring more staff,
so it's perfect timing.
Head Maid
1440108_4_a
Ma'am... Thank you so much!
Sinon
1440108_3_a
Sinon
1440108_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
I see... If that's the case, then
we'll hire that maid at our
estate.
Head Maid
1440108_1_a
Get her, boys!
Nobleman
1440107_18_a
But it's like you said... It's not
like any of that will help you
now!
Sinon
1440107_17_a
You're dragging your family's name
through the mud, being associated
with trash like this.
Sinon
1440107_16_a
These guys look like real bruisers.
This must be why that villager
told me to stay out of this.
Sinon
1440107_15_a
That's our cue, ain't it?
???
1440107_14_a
Of course, sir...
???
1440107_13_a
Gentlemen!
Nobleman
1440107_12_a
Heh! Someone talks a big game.
Not like any of that will help
you now!
Nobleman
1440107_11_a
Feel whatever you want. But if you
truly cared about her, you'd
start by considering her feelings.
Sinon
1440107_10_a
If I have feelings for her,
where's the harm in that?
Nobleman
1440107_9_a
This maid is working for my family
until she can pay off her family's
debt!
Nobleman
1440107_8_a
I know you're a brute
who needs to learn
some decency!
Sinon
1440107_7_a
Nngh... How dare you!
Don't you know who I am?
Nobleman
1440107_6_a
Hehe, now I understand...
He's an enemy mob!
Sinon
1440107_5_a
And now that I look closer...I can
see that noble has an HP bar!
Sinon
1440107_4_a
Oh, I see! This market is
set up in a field!
Sinon
1440107_3_a
I thought this bazaar was
all NPCs, so I shouldn't
get hit by anything...
Sinon
1440107_2_a
bg_21_alne
Huh?
He hit me...
Sinon
1440107_1_a
Sinon
1440105_21_a
bg_21_alne
Gwauh?!
Nobleman
1440105_20_a
bg_black
HAAAH!
Sinon
1440105_19_a
Learn to mind your own business or
Nobleman
1440105_18_a
What's up with you, lady?
This isn't your problem.
Nobleman
1440105_17_a
If there's one thing I hate, it's
people who abuse their authority!
Sinon
1440105_16_a
Sinon
1440105_15_a
Wh-What? Miss, I'm telling you this
for your own good! You do not want
to get involved!
Townsperson
1440105_14_a
So he's using his power to exploit her.
Just like in the real world...
Sinon
1440105_13_a
...I see.
Sinon
1440105_12_a
It seems that she wants to reject
the young man's advances, but
as a maid? Well...
Townsperson
1440105_11_a
So she ended up working as a
servant for that family in
order to pay it off.
Townsperson
1440105_10_a
She used to live here in this
village, but...her family
apparently incurred a lot of debt...
Townsperson
1440105_9_a
That's the son of a wealthy family
from the neighboring town
and their maid.
Townsperson
1440105_8_a
What's going on over there...?
Sinon
1440105_7_a
Come on, baby, I'll treat you
real nice... Heh heh....
???
1440105_6_a
Or, wait... Are you saying you'd
rather get fired?
???
1440105_5_a
What are you babbling about? I was
kind enough to hire you so you
could work off your debt, you know?
???
1440105_4_a
Hmm?
Sinon
1440105_3_a
S-Stop!
Master, please!
You shouldn't...
???
1440105_2_a
bg_21_alne
Well then... I guess that takes
care of today's shopping.
Sinon
1440105_1_a
Sinon
1440103_20_a
Thanks!
Asuna
1440103_19_a
I'll head right over.
Sinon
1440103_18_a
Hehe! It's all right.
Sinon
1440103_17_a
But I doubt that'll help
relieve your stress...
Asuna
1440103_16_a
I see... Well, I was going to ask
if you could go to the market
for me.
Asuna
1440103_15_a
My manager can be a real jerk.
Always moving around my shifts,
no matter what my plans are...
Sinon
1440103_14_a
Hehe... Are you mad about
something?
Asuna
1440103_13_a
I was just thinking I might work
off some aggression and
slaughter some baddies in GGO.
Sinon
1440103_12_a
Don't worry about it. My shift
got changed all of a sudden,
so I've got some free time.
Sinon
1440103_11_a
bg_21_alne
Sinonon! Sorry, I've got
to ask a favor!
Asuna
1440103_9_a
Sinon
1440103_10_a
Head Maid
1440103_8_a
...
Asuna
1440103_7_a
I don't suppose you know
any maids who could help?
Head Maid
1440103_6_a
Oh my... Yes, we are a bit
short-handed today.
Head Maid
1440103_5_a
There might not be enough maids
on duty to serve the guests
if I leave for the market...
Asuna
1440103_4_a
Huh...? But aren't we expecting
guests at the estate today?
Asuna
1440103_3_a
Asuna
1440103_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Today I will be sending you to buy
some provisions at the open-air
market in the field by the roadway.
Head Maid
1440103_1_a
Sinon
1440101_18_a
Looking forward to it!
Asuna
1440101_17_a
I'll try to come by and
say hello sometime.
Sinon
1440101_16_a
Hehe! Yeah, but, of course, I had
a fun time with you guys at
the estate.
Sinon
1440101_15_a
After all, you've been working
a lot lately, Sinonon.
Asuna
1440101_14_a
Ha ha! Yeah, I'd imagine you'd
be pretty fed up with that.
Asuna
1440101_13_a
so when I'm playing a VRMMO,
I don't really feel like having
people order me around.
Sinon
1440101_12_a
That's not quite it... It's just
that I'm always taking orders from
customers in my real job,
Sinon
1440101_11_a
You don't like being one?
Asuna
1440101_10_a
Hehe! Good thing you like
being a maid, Asuna.
Sinon
1440101_9_a
Yep. I still work there
from time to time.
Asuna
1440101_8_a
After you get used to being a
maid, you can stay on and keep
working at the estate, huh?
Sinon
1440101_7_a
Oh, right, those quests that
raise your maid skills, right?
Sinon
1440101_6_a
I noticed you haven't been doing
any maid quests lately...
Asuna
1440101_5_a
Asuna
1440101_4_a
Asuna... What's up?
Sinon
1440101_3_a
Oh! Hey, Sinonon!
Asuna
1440101_2_a
bg_21_alne
...
Sinon
1440101_1_a
Yeah! We're really looking forward
to it!
Asuna
1440098_23_a
I think I can finish one or two
more songs before the game ends.
Sinon
1440098_22_a
That said, I'm really enjoying it.
Will you guys wait for me
to complete a few more?
Sinon
1440098_21_a
Maybe so, but at this rate the
game will get taken offline before
I finish.
Sinon
1440098_20_a
Right. This is one task best left
to the pros.
Asuna
1440098_19_a
Haha, and it's not like we can
step in and help, either.
Kirito
1440098_18_a
It'll be ages before any of my
mixes sound anywhere near as
good as theirs.
Sinon
1440098_17_a
Besides, it looks like a lot of
music pros play, too. There are
some REALLY good arrangements.
Sinon
1440098_16_a
Kirito
1440098_15_a
Asuna
1440098_14_a
Give me a break! I can't crank
these out overnight, you know!
Sinon
1440098_13_a
Liz
1440098_12_a
Silica
1440098_11_a
Yeah! I can't wait to hear one
of your rock arrangements!
Yuuki
1440098_10_a
You've got a knack for this,
Sinonon!
Asuna
1440098_9_a
Kirito
1440098_8_a
Asuna
1440098_7_a
Oh, wow!
I was afraid you'd hate them...
Sinon
1440098_6_a
Yeah, that would definitely work!
Let's put it in the set!
Leafa
1440098_5_a
I agree! It'd be nice to have
a slower song in the middle of
the show!
Silica
1440098_4_a
Leafa
1440098_3_a
Silica
1440098_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Oh yeah, this is good!
Liz
1440098_1_a
Okay, great.
Shino
1440097_26_a
Of course!
We can't wait to hear them.
Asuna
1440097_25_a
It'll take me a few more days to
have more than one song ready.
I hope that's okay.
Shino
1440097_24_a
So, how's it going?
Kazuto
1440097_23_a
I can understand that.
Asuna
1440097_22_a
I didn't want to share anything
with the group until I had some
songs I was happy with.
Shino
1440097_21_a
I was still getting used to the
game myself, though. And I wasn't
sure I could use the software.
Shino
1440097_20_a
Okay then. But you know...
You could have told us that
you wanted to sing rock songs.
Kazuto
1440097_19_a
I've been turning the in-game
songs into rock numbers or
ballads.
Shino
1440097_18_a
What kind of song were you
thinking of making?
Asuna
1440097_17_a
Yeah, it's pretty crazy. But if
they can auto-generate quests,
a music editor must be a cakewalk.
Shino
1440097_16_a
Huh. I didn't know that.
Kazuto
1440097_15_a
Yeah, through an extra piece of
software. So I figured I'd give
it a try.
Shino
1440097_14_a
It is?
Kazuto
1440097_13_a
But the game also says it's
possible to arrange your own
songs.
Shino
1440097_12_a
and a lot of them are really
bright and poppy, since it's all
about being a pop star.
Asuna
1440097_11_a
Yeah, there's a pretty big
selection of original and pre-made
songs in there,
Asuna
1440097_10_a
But I figured that was because
we were locked in to the in-game
song selection.
Shino
1440097_9_a
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
that pop songs and dances aren't
really my thing.
Shino
1440097_8_a
So what's been on your mind
lately?
Kazuto
1440097_7_a
You didn't?
Asuna
1440097_6_a
Relax, Asuna. I never intended to
quit.
Shino
1440097_5_a
You're not quitting, are you?
Asuna
1440097_4_a
Kazuto
1440097_3_a
Asuna
1440097_2_a
bg_os_cafe
Ah, the band. Yeah, about that...
Shino
1440097_1_a
Huh?!
Shino
1440095_24_a
Kazuto
1440095_23_a
Don't quit the band, Shinonon!
Asuna
1440095_22_a
So you came all the way out here?
And in the real world, no less.
What's so important?
Shino
1440095_21_a
Asuna
1440095_20_a
We wanted to ask you something...
Kazuto
1440095_19_a
Kazuto! Asuna! What are you doing
here?
Shino
1440095_18_a
Kazuto
1440095_17_a
Hi there, Shinonon.
Asuna
1440095_16_a
Asuna
1440095_15_a
Hi.
Kazuto
1440095_14_a
bg_os_cafe
Hm?
Shino
1440095_13_a
Kazuto
1440095_12_a
Yeah...
Asuna
1440095_11_a
or if she would rather it be
dissolved entirely.
Kazuto
1440095_10_a
Fair point. But now we've
gotta ask her if she just wants
to leave the band,
Kazuto
1440095_9_a
So? Just say hi to someone like
a human being instead of stalking
them next time.
Asuna
1440095_8_a
She seemed totally absorbed.
I didn't want to bother her.
Kazuto
1440095_7_a
I didn't do it to be creepy!
She was listening to something on
her headphones.
Kazuto
1440095_6_a
Watched her? Like some creeper?
Why didn't you just say hi?
Asuna
1440095_5_a
Yeah, she's in the cafe just over
there. I watched her leave school.
Kazuto
1440095_4_a
Kazuto
1440095_3_a
Did you find Shinonon?
Asuna
1440095_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Asuna! Over here.
Kazuto
1440095_1_a
Yeah, I will.
Kirito
1440093_41_a
Leafa
1440093_40_a
Kirito
1440093_39_a
You should try talking to her,
Kirito.
Asuna
1440093_38_a
Liz
1440093_37_a
Silica
1440093_36_a
We're gonna have a hell of a hard
time beating this game if she
leaves...
Yuuki
1440093_35_a
Asuna
1440093_34_a
Leafa
1440093_33_a
Hm... That's a far cry from the
poppy dance numbers we're doing.
Kirito
1440093_32_a
I heard her say she'd like to do
a ballad or something.
Silica
1440093_31_a
Liz
1440093_30_a
Yuuki
1440093_29_a
Well, she has made some comments
recently.
Silica
1440093_28_a
Asuna
1440093_27_a
Kirito
1440093_26_a
I'm probably reading into things
a little too much...
Leafa
1440093_25_a
Does Sinon have a problem with
our sound?!
Yuuki
1440093_24_a
Wait... You don't think
Silica
1440093_23_a
Silica
1440093_22_a
Yuuki
1440093_21_a
Ah yeah, you'll have that with
some bands.
Liz
1440093_20_a
Some big disagreement about their
sound, I think.
Leafa
1440093_19_a
Do you know why they split?
Kirito
1440093_18_a
But then she said the band had
broken up recently.
Leafa
1440093_17_a
I figured she was a big fan of
theirs or something.
Leafa
1440093_16_a
When I asked her what it was, she
started telling me all about them.
Leafa
1440093_15_a
Asuna
1440093_14_a
Kirito
1440093_13_a
I ran into her in the real world
and heard her listening to a rock
band.
Leafa
1440093_12_a
Oh yeah?
Kirito
1440093_11_a
Kirito
1440093_9_a
Wait, I think I know what it is.
Leafa
1440093_8_a
Asuna
1440093_10_a
You think? She looked perfectly
fine to me.
Silica
1440093_7_a
Silica
1440093_6_a
Liz
1440093_5_a
Maybe she's coming down with
something?
Yuuki
1440093_4_a
Leafa
1440093_3_a
Kirito
1440093_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
What's gotten into Sinonon?
Asuna
1440093_1_a
Leafa
1440091_37_a
Asuna
1440091_36_a
Whoa, Sinon...!
Kirito
1440091_35_a
I'm just going to log out for
the night. Sorry.
Sinon
1440091_34_a
You know what, never mind.
Sinon
1440091_33_a
Don't get me wrong, I'm feeling
really good about what we've
achieved, but...
Sinon
1440091_32_a
Leafa
1440091_31_a
Asuna
1440091_30_a
What's wrong, Sinon?
Kirito
1440091_29_a
Ugh...
Sinon
1440091_28_a
Leafa
1440091_27_a
Asuna
1440091_26_a
Haha, I've never seen you guys
so happy!
Kirito
1440091_25_a
I don't know how karaoke works in
real life, but I'm really enjoying
climbing to the top with you guys!
Yuuki
1440091_24_a
Yuuki
1440091_23_a
Liz
1440091_22_a
But getting better at that part of
it gives you a real sense of
accomplishment!
Silica
1440091_21_a
This is a performance for other
people, and that comes with its
own pressures.
Asuna
1440091_20_a
Well, at karaoke you get to just
sing whatever you want with your
friends.
Asuna
1440091_19_a
Kirito
1440091_18_a
Asuna
1440091_17_a
Hehe, yeah! An audience gives you
a different kind of energy than
performing karaoke in real life.
Leafa
1440091_16_a
Performing on stage is actually
pretty fun now!
Liz
1440091_15_a
Yuuki
1440091_14_a
Silica
1440091_13_a
Yeah, and we're all starting to
gel as a group!
Liz
1440091_12_a
Looks like another great reaction
from the crowd!
Kirito
1440091_11_a
Asuna
1440091_9_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Great job!
Kirito
1440091_8_a
Leafa
1440091_10_a
Thanks so much, everyone!
Asuna
1440091_7_a
You're the best, Leafa!
Spectators
1440091_6_a
Silica, you are adorable!
Spectators
1440091_5_a
Leafa
1440091_4_a
Silica
1440091_3_a
Asuna
1440091_2_a
bg_event_idol_stage
Asunaaaa!
Spectators
1440091_1_a
Ha ha. Well, I'm counting on both
of you!
Kirito
1440088_31_a
Eep... Yeah, I did, didn't I...?
Asuna
1440088_30_a
You said practicing something a
million times is the only way to
do it right, didn't you?!
Yui
1440088_29_a
With that mindset, you won't be
able to do a good job when it
counts.
Yui
1440088_28_a
Umm... Sorry, Yui... It's just way
more embarrassing practicing than
it is just doing it...
Asuna
1440088_27_a
You were so much more enthusiastic
at the competition!
Yui
1440088_26_a
Mommy! Where's your cheerleading
spirit?
Yui
1440088_25_a
H-Hurray, hurray...
Go, Kirito...
Asuna
1440088_24_a
Go, Daddy, go!
Hurray, hurray!
Yui
1440088_23_a
Bye, see you later!
Yui
1440088_22_a
Y-Yeah...
Asuna
1440088_21_a
Really? In that case, come on,
Mommy! We have a lot of practicing
to do!
Yui
1440088_20_a
Yeah. I plan on taking part.
Kirito
1440088_19_a
Oh yeah, that dueling tournament
is coming up, right?
Asuna
1440088_18_a
Thanks, Yui. I'm counting on you.
Kirito
1440088_17_a
I'm ready and willing to give you
all the emotional support you'll
need when things get tough!
Yui
1440088_16_a
Yes, you do! Although my cheers
do not have any status-boosting
effects,
Yui
1440088_15_a
Hahaha, sweet. So in other words,
I got a monopoly on your
cheerleading?
Kirito
1440088_14_a
Hehehe, isn't it obvious?
To prepare for next time
we have to cheer you on!
Asuna
1440088_13_a
Actually, hold up: question!
Why are you still wearing those?
Kirito
1440088_12_a
Ha ha, you are one hardcore
drillmaster, Asuna.
Kirito
1440088_11_a
R-Right, got it!
Yui
1440088_10_a
So I want you to do that move
fifty more times, got it?
Asuna
1440088_9_a
Next lesson. Practicing something
a million times means it'll come
naturally in the heat of battle.
Asuna
1440088_8_a
Yes, we are!
Yui
1440088_7_a
Asuna
1440088_6_a
Yui
1440088_5_a
Hey, you two, still working on
improving Yui's battle skills?
Kirito
1440088_4_a
Yeah, nice one!
Just like that, Yui!
Asuna
1440088_3_a
Asuna
1440088_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Take THAT!
Yui
1440088_1_a
Yeah!
Kirito
1440087_36_a
But we've all made up now,
so everything's just peachy!
Yui
1440087_35_a
No, it was my fault for trying to
pretend that it didn't bother me.
Seriously, sorry.
Kirito
1440087_34_a
Kirito, sorry to make you suffer
in silence like that. I guess we
should've said something.
Asuna
1440087_33_a
Yes, they would make PvP extremely
unfair.
Yui
1440087_32_a
Ha ha... Well, that makes sense.
Those buffs are totally
overpowered.
Kirito
1440087_31_a
Also, they announced the event
rules, and cheer-based buffs are
prohibited. So yeah, moot point.
Asuna
1440087_30_a
Out of the picture.
Asuna
1440087_29_a
So in other words, that upcoming
competition is...
Kirito
1440087_28_a
So Yui and I decided that if you
asked us not to do it, we'd happily
comply.
Asuna
1440087_27_a
B-But I wasn't
Kirito
1440087_26_a
Then again, watching you fume
about it was really funny!
Yui
1440087_25_a
B-But...!
Kirito
1440087_24_a
Even if you didn't say it, it was
plastered all over your face.
Asuna
1440087_23_a
We knew you weren't happy that
everyone was making a fuss over us
in our cheerleading outfits, duh.
Asuna
1440087_22_a
What...just happened here?
Kirito
1440087_21_a
You're very late, Daddy.
Yui
1440087_20_a
We've been sitting here wondering
when you'd finally work up the
nerve to say it.
Asuna
1440087_19_a
Huh?!
Kirito
1440087_18_a
Finally.
Asuna
1440087_17_a
Hehehe...
Asuna
1440087_16_a
But...if there's still time to say
no, could I please ask you to turn
them down? Pretty please?
Kirito
1440087_15_a
But...I'm a little jealous of all
the attention you're getting.
Sorry, that sounded weird...
Kirito
1440087_14_a
I know it sounds pretty selfish
of me...
Kirito
1440087_13_a
Daddy...
Yui
1440087_12_a
But I'd rather that the only one
you cheer for...is me...
Kirito
1440087_11_a
I know it isn't my place to tell
you what to do, and I don't want
to try to control you...
Kirito
1440087_10_a
...
Asuna
1440087_9_a
Why?
Yui
1440087_8_a
Err, how do I put this...
Could you say no?
Kirito
1440087_7_a
Yeah?
Asuna
1440087_6_a
It's about that player that asked
you two for the cheering support
buff...
Kirito
1440087_5_a
What's up, Kirito?
Asuna
1440087_4_a
Asuna
1440087_3_a
Yui
1440087_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Oh, Asuna, Yui...
Kirito
1440087_1_a
Y-Yeah... Good idea...
Asuna
1440085_26_a
I'd be sure they aren't just doing
it for the lols or have some
darker intent before you agree.
Kirito
1440085_25_a
I'd caution you about one thing,
though
I'd make sure this player
is on the up and up.
Kirito
1440085_24_a
Ha ha, so in other words, leave me
out of this. It's your call!
Kirito
1440085_23_a
Daddy...
Yui
1440085_22_a
Kirito...
Asuna
1440085_21_a
But saying that...I won't stop you
if you want to do it.
Kirito
1440085_20_a
Honestly, you two are becoming a
hot topic. If it were me, I'd be
afraid it could get out of hand.
Kirito
1440085_19_a
Wait, you're asking me?
Uh, well...
Kirito
1440085_18_a
Kirito... What do you think
I should do?
Asuna
1440085_17_a
I see...
Kirito
1440085_16_a
Let me think about it.
I haven't made up my mind yet.
Asuna
1440085_15_a
And...what did you say?
Kirito
1440085_14_a
They even said they'd be willing
to trade materials or equipment
to secure her help.
Yui
1440085_13_a
They said they'd pay any price to
get her to cheer them on.
Yui
1440085_12_a
Y-Yeah...
Asuna
1440085_11_a
Provide support...? Wait, you're
talking about that ability buff
that outfit gives?
Kirito
1440085_10_a
Yeah. Thing is, they asked me to
come provide support during the
next tournament...
Asuna
1440085_9_a
Ha ha. Well, that outfit definitely
sticks out.
Kirito
1440085_8_a
But then this guild representative
saw me and came over...
Asuna
1440085_7_a
Well, I put this outfit on to help
Yui practice.
Asuna
1440085_6_a
What's wrong, Asuna?
Kirito
1440085_5_a
Mommy...
Yui
1440085_4_a
Kirito
1440085_3_a
Yui
1440085_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
What to do, what to do...
Asuna
1440085_1_a
Sure...
Kirito
1440083_27_a
We'll just be a minute, Kirito.
Asuna
1440083_26_a
Th-Thank you so, so much!
Player
1440083_25_a
Y-Yeah, I guess it's just a
picture.
Asuna
1440083_24_a
Um, why are you asking me?
But I guess if you two don't mind,
why not?
Kirito
1440083_23_a
D-Daddy, what do we do?!
Yui
1440083_22_a
Whaaat?! Seriously?!
Asuna
1440083_21_a
I want to remember this moment
forever!
Player
1440083_20_a
U-Um, would you mind taking a
photo with me? But in those
cheerleader outfits!
Player
1440083_19_a
Ahaha, thank you very much...
Asuna
1440083_18_a
I knew it! You two looked so
awesome!
Player
1440083_17_a
Oh, uh, yes...
Yes, we are...
Yui
1440083_16_a
You're the two who appeared in
that MMO Tomorrow interview,
right?
Player
1440083_15_a
Do you need something?
Asuna
1440083_14_a
Yeah?
Kirito
1440083_13_a
Umm...excuse me?
Player
1440083_12_a
Hurray for progress!
Kirito
1440083_11_a
Hehe, the world's a-changing,
Kirito. Progress!
Asuna
1440083_10_a
I remember you telling me how hard
it was to recreate the taste of
soy sauce back in SAO...
Kirito
1440083_9_a
I'm just impressed technology has
come so far that we can quickly
reproduce real-world flavors now.
Kirito
1440083_8_a
Yeah, but the real one's in Tokyo,
and a bit too far away. That's why
we're eating here first!
Asuna
1440083_7_a
Yay, pancakes! I'm excited!
I heard this place was very
popular in the real world too!
Yui
1440083_6_a
I'm so excited! Pancakes, Kirito!
PANCAKES!
Asuna
1440083_5_a
Awesome, then we're almost there.
Kirito
1440083_4_a
Asuna
1440083_3_a
Kirito
1440083_2_a
bg_21_alne
Daddy, the cafe is just a little
bit further down this big street.
Yui
1440083_1_a
Ha ha, I'm glad you're so happy.
Kirito
1440081_22_a
And even better, I'm really
excited that I can help you two
out in battle now too!
Yui
1440081_21_a
It was SO AMAZING!
I had tons of fun!
Yui
1440081_20_a
Right. So, how was the interview?
Kirito
1440081_19_a
Yeah... I'm normally not that
comfortable showing this much
skin...
Asuna
1440081_18_a
Is that why I just overheard you
say it was "kinda embarrassing"?
Kirito
1440081_17_a
Ahaha...
Asuna
1440081_16_a
Right... So I guess winner or not,
I was totally out of the picture
at the interview then, huh?
Kirito
1440081_15_a
The magazine said we really drew a
crowd at the event with them, so
they wanted us to wear them again!
Yui
1440081_14_a
But, how do I put this...
Why cheerleader outfits?
Kirito
1440081_13_a
Yeaaah, this is that interview I
really didn't want to do, so you
took my place. Right, Asuna?
Kirito
1440081_12_a
Yup! The other half of the reward
was making it so I can fight now!
Yui
1440081_11_a
Ahh, I remember now. That reward
from the competition we won, right?
Kirito
1440081_10_a
For MMO Tomorrow!
They interviewed both of us!
Asuna
1440081_9_a
Interview...?
Kirito
1440081_8_a
Oh, hi Kirito. We were just
getting interviewed. The thing
I told you about.
Asuna
1440081_7_a
Asuna
1440081_6_a
Yui
1440081_5_a
Hey, you two. What's with the
getups?
Kirito
1440081_4_a
Y-Yeah, I guess... It was also
kinda embarrassing...
Asuna
1440081_3_a
Asuna
1440081_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Mommy, that was so much fun!
Yui
1440081_1_a
Th-Thank you!
Kirito
1440068_32_a
J-Just take the damn chocolate and
say thank you!
Sinon
1440068_31_a
But...when we talked about it
during the quest...
Kirito
1440068_30_a
plus I wanted to get that Arrow
anyway!
Sinon
1440068_29_a
O-Only because we're friends!
It looked like it'd be tasty,
Sinon
1440068_28_a
Y-You did all this...to give me
chocolate?!
Kirito
1440068_27_a
Yeah. That was the reward.
Sinon
1440068_26_a
Wait...
This is chocolate...
Kirito
1440068_25_a
item_event_valentine
Yep. Here.
Sinon
1440068_24_a
Did you get the reward? What is
it, anyway?
Kirito
1440068_23_a
Well, that's good. Guess we did
the right thing.
Kirito
1440068_22_a
No. See? It says we cleared it
on the HoloWindow.
Sinon
1440068_21_a
But does this mean we can't
finish the quest?
Kirito
1440068_20_a
...
Sinon
1440068_19_a
Yeah. Even if they are only NPCs,
it's not cool to mess with
anyone's feelings like that...
Kirito
1440068_18_a
But maybe it's for the best...
Sinon
1440068_17_a
She went inside that house...
Cardinal only knows how this
will turn out now...
Kirito
1440068_16_a
There she goes...
Sinon
1440068_15_a
Wha...?
Kirito
1440068_14_a
S-So... I'm going to go by myself
and tell him how I feel!
Girl NPC
1440068_13_a
It's just... I think I should do
this on my own, without any
tricks...
Girl NPC
1440068_12_a
Huh?
But why?!
Kirito
1440068_11_a
I think I'd prefer if we didn't
use the arrow after all...
Girl NPC
1440068_10_a
Um... Excuse me...
Girl NPC
1440068_9_a
Seriously...?
Kirito
1440068_8_a
W-Well, a little... I just hope I
can aim this arrow true enough...
Sinon
1440068_7_a
Aren't you?
Kirito
1440068_6_a
Why are YOU getting nervous?
Sinon
1440068_5_a
My heart's pounding...
Kirito
1440068_4_a
Sinon
1440068_3_a
Kirito
1440068_2_a
bg_event_valentine_town
...
Girl NPC
1440068_1_a
...
Sinon
1440067_20_a
Sinon
1440067_19_a
Hey, does that mean you're finally
going to tell him how you feel?
Kirito
1440067_18_a
I-I understand. Then I'll take the
chocolate myself. Could you bring
me to the next village over?
Girl NPC
1440067_17_a
Sinon
1440067_16_a
Well, I'm not sure what will
happen. We've never used it...
Kirito
1440067_15_a
bg_event_valentine
So this arrow will make him feel
the same way I do...
Girl NPC
1440067_14_a
Kirito
1440067_13_a
Okay.
Sinon
1440067_12_a
Well, let's take this back to that
girl and see if anything else
happens.
Kirito
1440067_11_a
Yeah... But now there's finally
a quest that'll make use of it.
Sinon
1440067_10_a
so no one ever knew what it was
for.
Kirito
1440067_9_a
It's one of those strange items
that's easy to get, but not
especially powerful or anything,
Kirito
1440067_8_a
Well, it's not exclusive to this
specific quest.
Kirito
1440067_7_a
Sh-Shut up already. In any case,
it was surprisingly easy to get
ahold of.
Sinon
1440067_6_a
Same difference...
Kirito
1440067_5_a
The thing's actually called
Cupid's Passion.
Sinon
1440067_4_a
Ugh, enough with the commentary...
Sinon
1440067_3_a
Sinon
1440067_2_a
item_event_cupid_arrow
bg_event_dungeon_alo
This is basically Cupid's Arrow.
It makes you fall deeply, madly
in lo
Kirito
1440067_1_a
You're right.
Kirito
1440065_17_a
We might find something useful.
Sinon
1440065_16_a
Alright, let's find out more
about this arrow.
Sinon
1440065_15_a
Yeah.
Kirito
1440065_14_a
But if that item only works on
NPCs, then it must be specifically
for this scenario...
Sinon
1440065_13_a
I-It's DEFINITELY your
imagination!
Sinon
1440065_12_a
Is it just my imagination or do
you look a little disappointed?
Kirito
1440065_11_a
Hmmm... Well, in that case...
I guess it's an option.
Sinon
1440065_10_a
W-Well, I'm not totally sure, but
I think it only works on NPCs...
Kirito
1440065_9_a
Wh-What?! No way! Something that
messes with free will is going
way too far, even if it's just VR!
Sinon
1440065_8_a
There's that arrow that makes
you fall in love with whomever
shoots you...
Kirito
1440065_7_a
There has to be some foolproof
way of getting him to return
her feelings... Hmmm...
Sinon
1440065_6_a
T-True...
Kirito
1440065_5_a
We won't get anywhere with him
if we do this half-assed...
Sinon
1440065_4_a
Yeah. That NPC's crush is kind of
a stick in the mud, isn't he?
Sinon
1440065_3_a
Sinon
1440065_2_a
bg_21_alne
Hmmm... No new hints in this
village after all...
Kirito
1440065_1_a
R-Right.
Kirito
1440063_28_a
Forget it. Come on. We're wasting
time.
Sinon
1440063_27_a
Yeah... Wait, who's this "certain
someone"?
Kirito
1440063_26_a
Then we can look for an NPC as
popular as a certain someone.
Sinon
1440063_25_a
For now let's just head to the
next village over.
Sinon
1440063_24_a
Anyway, she gave us our hint. Now
what do we do?
Kirito
1440063_23_a
I guess...
Sinon
1440063_22_a
Better not let her hear you say
that. We might auto-fail...
Kirito
1440063_21_a
I wish she wouldn't drag us into
this just because she doesn't have
the courage to do it herself.
Sinon
1440063_20_a
Ha ha, yeah, I guess that's true.
Kirito
1440063_19_a
Acting all mushy because of
Valentine's Day...
Sinon
1440063_18_a
Acting like what?
Kirito
1440063_17_a
sigh
Even the NPCs are acting
like this... All I wanted was that
reward...
Sinon
1440063_16_a
Then the aim of this quest is to
make sure her feelings are
returned...
Kirito
1440063_15_a
Kirito
1440063_14_a
...
Sinon
1440063_13_a
I doubt he'll remember who I am
if all you do is give him the
chocolate...
Girl NPC
1440063_12_a
Yes, but he's so popular...
Lots of girls like him...
Girl NPC
1440063_11_a
So you want us to take this
Valentine's Day chocolate to him?
Kirito
1440063_9_a
Sinon
1440063_10_a
bg_event_valentine
There's this boy in the next
village over... I just want him to
know how I feel...
Girl NPC
1440063_8_a
Kirito
1440063_7_a
Y-Yeah...
Sinon
1440063_6_a
No problem. You'd do the same
for me.
Kirito
1440063_5_a
Um, hey... Thanks for helping me
out with this quest, by the way.
Sinon
1440063_4_a
Yeah, you're right.
Let's go talk to her.
Kirito
1440063_3_a
Kirito
1440063_2_a
bg_event_valentine
Kirito, I think that's the girl
with the quest.
Sinon
1440063_1_a
Alright... Yeah, I could probably
be convinced as long as it's
purely for gaming purposes...
Sinon
1440061_23_a
How about it, Sinonon?
Asuna
1440061_22_a
so even if you're not interested
in the holiday itself, you can
still have a fun time in-game.
Asuna
1440061_21_a
There are plenty of quests to do
and new items to get,
Asuna
1440061_20_a
Still, Valentine's Day is a big
deal this time of year.
Asuna
1440061_19_a
Ehehe...
Asuna
1440061_18_a
What do you mean, "probably"?
Everyone knows you're going to,
no point pretending otherwise.
Sinon
1440061_17_a
W-Well, probably...
Asuna
1440061_16_a
You're giving chocolate to Kirito,
aren't you?
Sinon
1440061_15_a
Oh...
Asuna
1440061_14_a
Me?! No way! Who would I give
stuff like that to?
Sinon
1440061_13_a
D-Don't you give chocolate or
anything to anyone?
Asuna
1440061_12_a
Ugh, keep that mushy stuff out
of VR, would you...
Sinon
1440061_11_a
Hahaha, that was a couple planning
to go out for Valentine's Day.
Asuna
1440061_10_a
What the heck was that?
Sinon
1440061_9_a
...
Sinon
1440061_8_a
G-Great!
Woman
1440061_7_a
Wh-What?!
Y-Yeah, absolutely!
Man
1440061_6_a
W-Would you like to hang out
the day after tomorrow...?
Woman
1440061_5_a
Huh?
Man
1440061_4_a
Asuna
1440061_3_a
Sinon
1440061_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
H-Hey...
Woman
1440061_1_a
あはは……
アスナ
1440058_32_a
わかればよろしい
シノン
1440058_31_a
は、ハイ……申し訳ありません
破魔矢の素材集め、
手伝わせていただきます……
キリト
1440058_30_a
よこしまなアンタを
ここで滅してあげてもいいのよ……?
シノン
1440058_29_a
破魔矢は邪悪なものを
滅する矢でしょ?
シノン
1440058_28_a
あ、危ないですよ?
キリト
1440058_27_a
え、ええと……シノンさん
返そうとしてた矢を弓につがえて、
こちらに向けるのは……
キリト
1440058_26_a
キリト……
尻尾がなんだって……?
シノン
1440058_25_a
俺、やる気が出ちゃうかも……
キリト
1440058_24_a
おおっ、そうだ
ケットシーのあのモフモフの尻尾を
もう一度触らせてもらえるなら
キリト
1440058_23_a
そうだよ、キリトくん!
シノのんは友達でしょ?
アスナ
1440058_22_a
な、なにを考えてるの……
シノン
1440058_21_a
さすがに無償ってのは
どうだろうなぁ～?
キリト
1440058_20_a
だって一応攻略法も見つけてやった
わけだし、破魔矢の素材集めまで
手伝うとなると、
キリト
1440058_19_a
えっ?
シノン
1440058_18_a
そうだな……でも……
それはいいとしても、
なにか見返りが欲しいトコだなぁ
キリト
1440058_17_a
それなら今一緒にやろうよ
わたし達も手伝うからさ
アスナ
1440058_16_a
破魔矢は時間かければ
絶対に作れるわけだし、そのうち
また時間作ってやっておくわ
シノン
1440058_15_a
大丈夫よ
シノン
1440058_14_a
あっ……でもこれ返されると、
シノンは破魔弓を使えないのか?
キリト
1440058_13_a
キリト
1440058_12_a
そうね……はい、これ返すわ
シノン
1440058_11_a
良かったね
そのやり方前提のクエスト
だったんだろうね
アスナ
1440058_10_a
だからモタついてるそいつらを
片っ端から仕留めていったら、
すごく楽にクリアできたわ
シノン
1440058_9_a
なるほど、破魔矢の退魔の力を
恐れてるってことなんだろうな
キリト
1440058_8_a
増援はどんどん出るんだけど、
一定以上はこちらに近づいてこなくて
なんだか……恐れてるみたいだった
シノン
1440058_7_a
ええ、そのとおりよ
破魔矢を持ってるだけで
敵のアクションがだいぶ変わったの
シノン
1440058_6_a
ははっ、その顔だと
無事に破魔弓をゲットできた
みたいだな
キリト
1440058_5_a
シノのん、お帰り!
アスナ
1440058_4_a
キリト
1440058_3_a
アスナ
1440058_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
キリト、アスナ!
ただいま!
シノン
1440058_1_a
ありがとう、二人とも!
じゃあもう一度行ってくるわね
シノン
1440057_21_a
うん、シノのん
ぜひ使ってみて!
アスナ
1440057_20_a
ああ、いいぜ
キリト
1440057_19_a
キリト、アスナ
申し訳ないけど、
これ一旦貸してもらえるかしら?
シノン
1440057_18_a
……なるほど
やってみる価値はあるわ
シノン
1440057_17_a
ああ、厄避けだろ?　もしかしたら
これを持つことで、敵の増援を
防ぐことができるのかもしれない
キリト
1440057_16_a
あっ……!
破魔矢って元々……
アスナ
1440057_15_a
今回も似たような
敵の仕様にしてるんだとしたら……
恐らく突破口は別にあるんだと思う
キリト
1440057_14_a
あれはどう考えても、
バランス無視の無理ゲー設定だ
キリト
1440057_13_a
俺は以前世界樹のダンジョンで
似たような目に遭ったことがある
キリト
1440057_12_a
そうよ……
シノン
1440057_11_a
そのダンジョン、敵が無尽蔵に
押し寄せてくるって言ってたよな
キリト
1440057_10_a
キリトくん……どういうこと?
アスナ
1440057_9_a
でももしかしてそれは……
そういう思考を利用した
罠なのかもしれない
キリト
1440057_8_a
破魔矢と破魔弓、
どちらも狙うプレイヤーなら
普通そう考えるよな
キリト
1440057_7_a
え、ええ素材集めに時間が
かかりそうだったから、
後回しにしてたの
シノン
1440057_6_a
ああ、そうだ
シノン、まだ持ってないんだろ?
キリト
1440057_5_a
これは……
もしかして……破魔矢?
シノン
1440057_4_a
シノン
1440057_3_a
アスナ
1440057_2_a
item_event_hamaya
bg_event_dungeon_alo
シノン
こいつを持っていったらどうだ?
キリト
1440057_1_a
なるほどな……
キリト
1440055_16_a
その度に脱出を繰り返して……
今のところキルはされてないけど、
集中力が切れるとまずそうね
シノン
1440055_15_a
最終的に対処できないくらいの
Mob集団に囲まれちゃうのよ……
シノン
1440055_14_a
ええ、最初は少ないし、
そんなに強くもないんだけど……
次第にどんどん増えてきて、
シノン
1440055_13_a
無尽蔵に?
アスナ
1440055_12_a
そうね……強いて言うなら、
敵の援軍が無尽蔵にPOPする
ところかしら……
シノン
1440055_11_a
敵が強いとか多いとか、ダンジョンの
ギミックがややこしいとか、
難しいにも色々あるだろ?
キリト
1440055_10_a
えっ?
シノン
1440055_9_a
シノン……ちなみにそのクエ、
どんな風に難しいんだ?
キリト
1440055_8_a
ええ、だから気持ちだけは
もらっておくわ
シノン
1440055_7_a
そ、そっか……
じゃあわたし達には
協力することもできないんだね……
アスナ
1440055_6_a
というか難関クエストである以上、
ソロじゃなかったら、
最初から二人にも手助け頼んでたわ
シノン
1440055_5_a
ええ、そうなの
シノン
1440055_4_a
アスナ
1440055_3_a
シノン
1440055_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
なに?
ソロ専用のクエスト?
キリト
1440055_1_a
キリト、アスナ……
お言葉はありがたいんだけど……
実は……
シノン
1440053_27_a
うん!
アスナ
1440053_26_a
まあでもここで会ったが
吉日ってやつだ
俺たちも手伝うよ
キリト
1440053_25_a
まあその認識も間違いじゃないけど、
やり込み要素として破魔弓の方も
セットで用意されたらしいわ
シノン
1440053_24_a
俺もだ……
キリト
1440053_23_a
わたしてっきり破魔矢って
お正月の賑やかしアイテムかと……
アスナ
1440053_22_a
そ、そうなんだ……
知らなかったよ
アスナ
1440053_21_a
しかもその火力がALOの弓矢の
中でもトップクラスなのよ
シノン
1440053_20_a
ええ、それを手に入れることで、
破魔矢も武器として扱えるように
なるの
シノン
1440053_19_a
破魔弓……?
キリト
1440053_18_a
破魔矢の対になるアイテム
《破魔弓》が手に入るの
シノン
1440053_17_a
でもね、あそこから通じてる
ダンジョンで請けられる
特殊クエストで……
シノン
1440053_16_a
ああ、そのはずだが……
キリト
1440053_15_a
それ自体は装備できないし、
戦う力もないわ……
シノン
1440053_14_a
そうだったのね
破魔矢はあくまで観賞用のアイテム
シノン
1440053_13_a
ようやく素材が揃ったところ
だったんだよ
アスナ
1440053_12_a
ああ、ちょうど俺たちも
それを作ってたんだ
キリト
1440053_11_a
この周辺で採れる素材で作る
《破魔矢》って知ってる?
シノン
1440053_10_a
どんなクエスト?
アスナ
1440053_9_a
そこであるクエストを
攻略してたんだけど、
それがやたらと難しくて……
シノン
1440053_8_a
え、ええ……
私はあのフィールドから進める
特殊空間に行っていたの
シノン
1440053_7_a
なんかあの空間に
いきなり放り出されたって
感じがしたけど
アスナ
1440053_6_a
シノのん、一体なにがあったの?
アスナ
1440053_5_a
そうか、良かったよ
ギリギリセーフだったな
キリト
1440053_4_a
アスナ
1440053_3_a
キリト
1440053_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
ふぅ……助かったわ
ポーションも
もう無くなってたから……
シノン
1440053_1_a
う、うん!
アスナ
1440051_19_a
キ、キリト!?
それにアスナ……!
シノン
1440051_18_a
シ、シノのん!?
どうしたのこんなところで!?
アスナ
1440051_17_a
シノン
1440051_16_a
アスナ
1440051_15_a
えっ!?
キリト
1440051_14_a
………………
キリト
1440051_13_a
う、うん
アスナ
1440051_12_a
行ってみよう……
キリト
1440051_11_a
あっちの方から聞こえてきたね……
アスナ
1440051_10_a
なんだ今の声……
キリト
1440051_9_a
あはは、そう言えばそうだね……
アスナ
1440051_8_a
ああ、早速ログハウスに飾ろうぜ
神棚とかはないけど……
うーん、どこに飾ればいいのか……
キリト
1440051_7_a
うん、これって武器じゃないからね
鑑賞物……現実と同じで、
家に置いとく縁起物だから
アスナ
1440051_6_a
集めるのに時間がかかるけど、
誰でも作れるのがいいよな
キリト
1440051_5_a
ああ、俺たちが今集めていた素材で
作るのは正月シーズン限定の
アイテム《破魔矢》……
キリト
1440051_4_a
これくらい素材を集めれば
十分だよね
アスナ
1440051_3_a
アスナ
1440051_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
よし、そろそろ終わろう
アスナ
キリト
1440051_1_a
ふふっ、わかったわ
そうするわ
シノン
1440048_17_a
嫌がらずにちゃんとわたしを
連れてってね
アスナ
1440048_16_a
ふふっ、だからこれからも
似たようなクエストがあっても、
アスナ
1440048_15_a
そう……良かったわ
シノン
1440048_14_a
むしろ連れてきてくれてありがとう
楽しかったし……それにシノのんの
役に立てて、わたしも嬉しかったよ
アスナ
1440048_13_a
ちょ、ちょっと止めてよ
全然そんなの気にしないよ
アスナ
1440048_12_a
あなたのアシストのおかげで、
私はこいつを倒すことができたのよ
ごめんなさい、アスナ……
シノン
1440048_11_a
でも結果的にそうしなければ、
目的は達成できなかった……
シノン
1440048_10_a
あなたに謝らないといけないわね……
最初ここにあなたを連れてくることを、
私は反対したけど……
シノン
1440048_9_a
良かったね
アスナ
1440048_8_a
報酬の装備も
手に入れることができたわ
シノン
1440048_7_a
でもアスナのおかげよ
幻のトラ《ファントム・ティーグル》を
倒して、
シノン
1440048_6_a
えへへ……
おかげで翅がだいぶやられちゃったよ
あとで回復魔法かけておかなきゃね
アスナ
1440048_5_a
まさか全速力で飛びながら
トラを追いかけるとは思わなかったわ
シノン
1440048_4_a
まったく……
アスナったら無茶するわね
シノン
1440048_3_a
シノン
1440048_2_a
bg_18_mountain
やったー!
シノのん、無事に仕留めたんだね!
おめでとう!
アスナ
1440048_1_a
ぜええええりゃあああっ!!!
アスナ
1440047_22_a
えっ!?
わ、わかったわ!
シノン
1440047_21_a
シノのんはもう一度弓矢を構えて!
地上に落ちてきたところを
仕留めるつもりで!!
アスナ
1440047_20_a
ア、アスナ!?
飛んで追いかけるなんて無茶よ!
翅がボロボロになるわ!!
シノン
1440047_19_a
はあああっ……!!
アスナ
1440047_18_a
は、外した!!
くっ……気づかれるなんて!
シノン
1440047_17_a
……!
アスナ
1440047_16_a
……せいっ!
シノン
1440047_15_a
………………
アスナ
1440047_14_a
じゃあ行くわ……
シノン
1440047_13_a
う、うん
アスナ
1440047_12_a
アスナはそこで見ていて
音は絶対に立てないようにね
シノン
1440047_11_a
残念だけど、さっき言ったように、
これは最初の一撃がすべてだから
シノン
1440047_10_a
シノのん、わたしにできることはない?
アスナ
1440047_9_a
でも残念ね……
あなたはこの狩人シノンに
狩られることになる……
シノン
1440047_8_a
そうね
惚れ惚れするような、
神々しい佇まいと言ったところかしら
シノン
1440047_7_a
威風堂々としているというか……
アスナ
1440047_6_a
ほ、ほんとだ……
うわぁ……なんか幻のトラって
言われるだけあるね
アスナ
1440047_5_a
あの大きな木陰の下よ……
休んでるみたいだけど……
寝てる訳じゃないわね
シノン
1440047_4_a
えっ、どこ!?
アスナ
1440047_3_a
アスナ
1440047_2_a
bg_18_mountain
いた……!
シノン
1440047_1_a
ふふっ、ごめんなさい
シノン
1440045_29_a
もーっ、違うよシノのん!
ヒドイよー!
アスナ
1440045_28_a
ただ意地張ってるだけじゃ
なかったのね……
シノン
1440045_27_a
なるほどね
アスナの中でちゃんと定義があるのね
シノン
1440045_26_a
武器は別に制約でもなんでもないからね
ただ弓矢を使えばいいって
だけの話だし
アスナ
1440045_25_a
種族の違いは
最初に決められたものだから、
諦めが悪くなっちゃうんだけど……
アスナ
1440045_24_a
う、ううん
そんなことないよ
アスナ
1440045_23_a
もしかして剣で倒したいって
思ってる?
シノン
1440045_22_a
ふふっ、不利だからと投げ出すのが
嫌なアスナさん的には
納得いかないかしら?
シノン
1440045_21_a
………………
アスナ
1440045_20_a
そうね……
シノン
1440045_19_a
なるほど……
じゃあ弓矢で急所に当てるのが、
唯一の倒す手段ってことなんだね
アスナ
1440045_18_a
見つかる前の最初の一発で仕留めないと
失敗と考えるしかないわ
シノン
1440045_17_a
つまり初動がすべてなの
シノン
1440045_16_a
ふふっ、アスナ察しがいいわね
そのとおり……今回の標的は
見つかったらアウトよ
シノン
1440045_15_a
一度逃げられたら二度と
捕捉不可能ってことじゃ?
アスナ
1440045_14_a
確かに……あれ?
でも、つまりそれって……
アスナ
1440045_13_a
飛び回って動くことが
可能なのかもしれないわ
シノン
1440045_12_a
そうね……でも相手はトラ
木登りが得意だし、木々の間を
シノン
1440045_11_a
そのモンスターも動きにくいと
思うけど……
アスナ
1440045_10_a
でも……この木の幹や枝が密集した
空間で、しかも地面までぬめってるん
だから、
アスナ
1440045_9_a
非常に困難だって言われてる
レアモンスターよ
シノン
1440045_8_a
そうよ、滅多に人前に姿を現すことが
なく、しかもエンカウントできても
仕留めるのは、
シノン
1440045_7_a
ええと……
名前は確かトラ型のモンスター
《ファントム・ティーグル》だったよね
アスナ
1440045_6_a
地上のダンジョンの深部に
お目当てがいるの
シノン
1440045_5_a
ええ、そうね
そしてこの大自然が作り上げた
シノン
1440045_4_a
入り組んでて、まさに樹海って
呼ぶにふさわしい感じだね……
アスナ
1440045_3_a
シノン
1440045_2_a
bg_18_mountain
それにしても本当に鬱蒼とした
森だね……
アスナ
1440045_1_a
うん、わかったよ!
アスナ
1440043_19_a
付いてくるなら本気で付いてきて!
シノン
1440043_18_a
まあ気合いが入ってるのは
よくわかったわ
ただ甘やかすつもりはないから……
シノン
1440043_17_a
あはは、やっぱそう思います?
アスナ
1440043_16_a
はぁ……なんとなくはわかったけど
ずいぶんと反抗期なのね、お嬢様
シノン
1440043_15_a
その気持ちが今もどこかで
燻ってるのかもしれない
アスナ
1440043_14_a
あるときを境に、この世界には
絶対に負けたくないって思うように
なったの……
アスナ
1440043_13_a
それと……SAOにダイブしたころ、
しばらくわたしはずっと
街に引きこもってたんだけど……
アスナ
1440043_12_a
不利なことはわかってても不可能じゃ
ないなら、絶対にクリアしてやるぞって
気になるというか……
アスナ
1440043_11_a
種族が違うから不利とか、
種族の特徴があるから無理だとか、
そういう状況にあえて挑戦したくなるの
アスナ
1440043_10_a
どういうこと?
シノン
1440043_9_a
あとは、世界に負けたくない……
そう思ってるのかもしれないな
アスナ
1440043_8_a
PvPはどうしても……
前のゲームでの嫌なことを
想い出しちゃうし……
アスナ
1440043_7_a
抵抗……?
プレイヤー同士で戦いたくないから、
種族システムも嫌いってこと?
シノン
1440043_6_a
それに抵抗したい……
どこかで、そう思ってるのかも
しれない
アスナ
1440043_5_a
そうね
シノン
1440043_4_a
それが結果的に
このALOのPvP要素を
後押ししてるでしょ?
アスナ
1440043_3_a
シノン
1440043_2_a
bg_18_mountain
わたしね……
種族って仕様が無ければいい……
とまでは言わないんだけど……
アスナ
1440043_1_a
………………
アスナ
1440041_16_a
それは来る前にも言ったと思うけど、
どうしてアスナ無理して付いてくるって
言ったの……?
シノン
1440041_15_a
そうね
視界が狭まるからこそ、
目のいいケットシーしか歩けないって訳
シノン
1440041_14_a
これだけ枝が密集してると、
実質飛行できないのと同じだね……
アスナ
1440041_13_a
ALOなんだし飛べばなんとかなるって
思ったんだけど、
アスナ
1440041_12_a
べ、別に怒ってはいないけど……
シノン
1440041_11_a
ご、ごめんね、シノのん
足引っ張っちゃって……
怒ってる?
アスナ
1440041_10_a
何度も言ったじゃない……
シノン
1440041_9_a
目が良くて、小回りの利く
アクションが得意なケットシーの……
いわば専用の屋外ダンジョンなの
シノン
1440041_8_a
この森を踏破するのって、
元々ケットシー以外の種族は
あまり向いていないのよ
シノン
1440041_7_a
アスナ……
だから言ったでしょ?
シノン
1440041_6_a
イタッ!
枝が身体中に当たって
歩きにくいね……
アスナ
1440041_5_a
………………
シノン
1440041_4_a
ぬかるみに足がハマっちゃった……
アスナ
1440041_3_a
シノン
1440041_2_a
bg_18_mountain
わわっ!
アスナ
1440041_1_a
Hahaha!
Kirito
1440028_19_a
Y-You idiot, don't say I didn't
warn you!
Sinon
1440028_18_a
Hehe, well I guess I'll just
have to see for myself.
Kirito
1440028_17_a
Urk...! I-It's not going to be
anything special!
Sinon
1440028_16_a
I can't wait to see you
dressed up as a demon, Sinon.
Kirito
1440028_15_a
Oh, fine. Anyway, I'm going to go
make that costume.
Sinon
1440028_14_a
But no promises to be an
accomplice for anything super
crazy you might have in mind.
Kirito
1440028_13_a
Hahaha! I'll be happy to help you
with whatever I can, as long
as it's feasible.
Kirito
1440028_12_a
Instead of using 'em one at a
time, maybe I'll wait for
something big and cash 'em all in.
Sinon
1440028_11_a
Hehe, I guess you could put it
that way.
Sinon
1440028_10_a
So you're just saving up favors
now?
Kirito
1440028_9_a
Anyway, I've racked up another
favor to collect from you. I
look forward to cashing it in.
Sinon
1440028_8_a
I guess...
Sinon
1440028_7_a
Hahaha, don't be like that.
It's all a matter of luck
with games like this.
Kirito
1440028_6_a
After all, we were only getting
supposedly "rare" items that a
certain someone wanted...
Sinon
1440028_5_a
I'm just glad it finally
dropped...
Sinon
1440028_4_a
Woohoo, that's great!
Kirito
1440028_3_a
Kirito
1440028_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Phew... I finally have what I
need to make that demon
costume...
Sinon
1440028_1_a
I'm glad one of us is in a good
mood...
Sinon
1440027_20_a
Yes! Thank you, Sinon!
You're amazing!
Kirito
1440027_19_a
How about I just let you have it
in exchange for a future favor?
Sinon
1440027_18_a
Hehe, I was kidding.
But it does feel a little unfair
to give it to you for nothing...
Sinon
1440027_17_a
Y-You're going to sell it?!
Then let me buy it!
Kirito
1440027_16_a
I bet I could get a good price
for it, since it's so rare and
all...
Sinon
1440027_15_a
Wh-What?!
Kirito
1440027_14_a
But I already gave you something
for helping me out. I don't have
to give you this too, right?
Sinon
1440027_13_a
Oh, whatever...
Sinon
1440027_12_a
Y-You don't trust me at all,
do you...?
Kirito
1440027_11_a
I wonder...
Sinon
1440027_10_a
How would I know what items the
monsters here drop? It's just a
coincidence!
Kirito
1440027_9_a
N-No way!
You're totally overthinking this!
Kirito
1440027_8_a
Hey... You didn't agree to help
me because you knew this would
happen, did you...?
Sinon
1440027_7_a
I can't believe I'm only getting
the items YOU want...
Sinon
1440027_6_a
It... It is! Sinon, that's another
item I'm after!
Kirito
1440027_5_a
A Sacred Cerulean Crystal...
This is one of those campaign
items too, isn't it?
Sinon
1440027_4_a
Let's see...
Kirito
1440027_3_a
Kirito
1440027_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Hmm...
I got another weird rare item...
Sinon
1440027_1_a
Easy for you to say, now that you
have what you wanted...
Sinon
1440025_28_a
Hahaha! Don't worry about it so
much. Let's just relax and have
a good time!
Kirito
1440025_27_a
sigh
... I wish I could get the
materials I need for the demon
costume that easy...
Sinon
1440025_26_a
Thank you!
You're the best!
Kirito
1440025_25_a
Well then... There you go.
I transferred it over, it's all
yours.
Sinon
1440025_24_a
Yeah, of course!
Kirito
1440025_23_a
Sure, be my guest. But that means
we're even, okay? You help me,
I give you the crystal.
Sinon
1440025_22_a
Sinon, can I... Can I have this?
Kirito
1440025_21_a
This is one of the items you have
to collect in another campaign
that I'm working on!
Kirito
1440025_20_a
A what?
Sinon
1440025_19_a
Whoa!
This is a Sacred Scarlet Crystal!
Kirito
1440025_18_a
Huh?
Wait, let me see that!
Kirito
1440025_17_a
I got a rare item,
but it's not one I wanted...
Sinon
1440025_16_a
What's wrong?
Kirito
1440025_15_a
Kirito
1440025_14_a
sigh
...
Sinon
1440025_13_a
Sinon
1440025_12_a
I guess you're right...
Sinon
1440025_11_a
I wouldn't let it get to you.
Kirito
1440025_10_a
Something like that. I mean,
rare items wouldn't be rare if
they dropped all the time, right?
Kirito
1440025_9_a
What? Like I was more patient
last time because I only wanted
them for Asuna's sake?
Sinon
1440025_8_a
Maybe it just seems like that
'cause you want them for yourself
now, not for someone else.
Kirito
1440025_7_a
But now the demons aren't dropping
any of the materials I need...
Sinon
1440025_6_a
When we were helping Asuna, we
got everything she needed without
a hitch.
Sinon
1440025_5_a
What's with the deep sigh, Sinon?
Kirito
1440025_4_a
sigh
...
Sinon
1440025_3_a
Sinon
1440025_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
We'll finish this quest in no
time!
Kirito
1440025_1_a
Then let's get this show on
the road!
Kirito
1440023_26_a
...But thank you, hehe.
Sinon
1440023_25_a
You sound like a soap opera actor.
A bad one.
Sinon
1440023_24_a
Perhaps this fateful meeting is a
sign that I should accompany you!
Kirito
1440023_23_a
Oh, Sinon, fancy meeting you
here!
Kirito
1440023_22_a
Then...
Kirito
1440023_21_a
Hahaha, yeah.
But I can tell this isn't the way
you'd prefer me to offer...
Kirito
1440023_20_a
What? You mean helping me get
the materials I need?
Sinon
1440023_19_a
I see.
Well, I can do you a favor.
Kirito
1440023_18_a
I didn't think I'd have any
trouble completing it a second
time on my own.
Sinon
1440023_17_a
Besides, I already did this
demon-hunting quest with Asuna
and the others.
Sinon
1440023_16_a
Y-You know how much
appearances matter to me...
Sinon
1440023_15_a
What are you embarrassed about?
Kirito
1440023_14_a
I suppose denying it now would be
even more embarrassing...
You're right...
Sinon
1440023_13_a
...
Sinon
1440023_12_a
You...!
Sinon
1440023_11_a
I kind of had a feeling you wanted
a Halloween costume after all.
Kirito
1440023_10_a
K-Kirito? What are you doing here?
Sinon
1440023_9_a
It's okay to ask for help if you
can't do something on your own.
Kirito
1440023_8_a
Huh?!
Sinon
1440023_7_a
Gyaaaaaaaaaah!
Demon
1440023_6_a
Not so fast!
Kirito
1440023_5_a
Hey! You're running away again?!
Ugh!
Sinon
1440023_4_a
Gyahaaaah!
Demon
1440023_3_a
Tch! It's not going to be easy to
take you down on my own, is it?
Sinon
1440023_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Gyaaaaaah!
Demon
1440023_1_a
...
Kirito
1440021_19_a
I suppose... I'll consider it.
Sinon
1440021_18_a
Yep! It doesn't have to be useful!
Trying on different clothes
in VR is cool in and of itself!
Liz
1440021_17_a
Hehe, it's fun to pick one out
just based off of how it looks
too.
Silica
1440021_16_a
Uh... I suppose, if there was one
that had a useful buff or skill
or something...
Sinon
1440021_15_a
Speaking of Halloween costumes!
Didn't you want to try and make
one, Sinon?
Leafa
1440021_14_a
N-No, it's nothing...
Sinon
1440021_13_a
Is something wrong, Sinon?
Silica
1440021_12_a
...
Sinon
1440021_11_a
O-Of course I will!
Kirito
1440021_10_a
You better compliment the crap
out of her the next time she
dives in!
Liz
1440021_9_a
That's all you have to say
about it?!
Liz
1440021_8_a
Me? Uh...yeah, it was cute.
Kirito
1440021_7_a
What did you think, Kirito?
Liz
1440021_6_a
It made me kind of wish I'd gone
for the demon costume instead
of the witch's...
Leafa
1440021_5_a
It was! The first time I saw it
on her, I just couldn't stop
staring!
Silica
1440021_4_a
Leafa
1440021_3_a
Silica
1440021_2_a
bg_18_tower
Asuna's demon costume was
absolutely adorable, wasn't it?
Liz
1440021_1_a
I'll remember that.
See you again soon.
Sinon
1440018_15_a
We will! Thank you again, Alicia!
Silica
1440018_14_a
Let me know if you ever need my
help again! I've got your backs!
Alicia
1440018_13_a
Nah, don't mention it. Besides,
I earned bragging rights today!
We're amazing!
Alicia
1440018_12_a
Alright then... Thanks, Alicia.
Sinon
1440018_11_a
O-Okay, if you insist...
Sinon
1440018_10_a
Happy to hear it. But seriously,
Sinon, no need for weird titles.
Call me Alicia!
Alicia
1440018_9_a
You saved our skin.
Sinon
1440018_8_a
She's right, you know.
Thanks, Alicia-
Ack, I mean "boss."
Sinon
1440018_7_a
That's not true! If you hadn't
helped us, our plan would have
never gotten off the ground.
Silica
1440018_6_a
You say three, but I didn't do
anything. I was nothing more
than a glorified dragon taxi.
Alicia
1440018_5_a
Hehe, I second that.
Sinon
1440018_4_a
Alicia
1440018_3_a
Sinon
1440018_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_sunset
I never imagined we could beat
this quest with only three people!
Silica
1440018_1_a
Now get ready to die!
Sinon
1440017_17_a
Sorry, monsters, but today's your
unlucky day. You will fall before
my overwhelming power!
Sinon
1440017_16_a
Heh. Silica... Nicely done.
Now this quest is all but mine.
Sinon
1440017_15_a
The ballista's stopped...
Sinon
1440017_14_a
Silica
1440017_13_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
1440017_12_a
We just need to distract the
ballista team while Sinon attacks!
Silica
1440017_11_a
Pina, remember! We don't have to
defeat them.
Silica
1440017_10_a
Chirrrp!
Pina
1440017_9_a
Now it's my time to shine!
Silica
1440017_8_a
Okay! Thanks again!
Silica
1440017_7_a
Got it! Just signal me when you
need to be picked up!
Alicia
1440017_6_a
Alicia! I'm good!
Fall back for now!
Silica
1440017_5_a
Nahaha! Come on, it was nothing!
I'm just happy we're not PvPing!
Alicia
1440017_4_a
Got it, Alicia! Thank you very
much for giving me a ride on
your dragon!
Silica
1440017_3_a
Silica
1440017_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
Silica! I'm going to descend here!
Get ready for drop off!
Alicia
1440017_1_a
A-Actually...
Silica
1440015_23_a
I'm the Cait Sith boss!
It's my job to help a fellow cat!
Alicia
1440015_22_a
Something troubling you, huh?
Give me the lowdown!
Alicia
1440015_21_a
...Wh-?!
Sinon
1440015_20_a
Oh! Hi, Alicia!
Silica
1440015_19_a
Hey hey! Look at you two kitties!
What's with the gloom and doom?
Alicia
1440015_18_a
I guess we're out of options...
Silica
1440015_17_a
Yeah. It's a pretty big cave, but
it's too dark down there to fly.
Sinon
1440015_16_a
But the whole thing takes place
underground, right?
Silica
1440015_15_a
I thought about flying in from
above too...
Silica
1440015_14_a
Perhaps...
Sinon
1440015_13_a
Ahaha...
I guess it IS impossible.
Silica
1440015_12_a
But there's no way I could get
in there alone...
Silica
1440015_11_a
Pina and I could distract them
so they couldn't fire...
Silica
1440015_10_a
Hmmm...
If I could get close to it...
Silica
1440015_9_a
If only...
Sinon
1440015_8_a
If only you could disrupt the
ballista engineers long enough
to take out the other mobs...
Silica
1440015_7_a
Well, you don't have to take out
the ballista, right? Just make it
so it can't bother you...
Silica
1440015_6_a
Okay, busted...but I'm fresh out
of ideas. Got any for me, Silica?
Sinon
1440015_5_a
I know exactly what you're
thinking. 'If I could only deal
with that ballista...'
Silica
1440015_4_a
H-Huh? I haven't...?
Sinon
1440015_3_a
Sinon
1440015_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Hehe, I can see it in your eyes!
You haven't given up at all,
have you?
Silica
1440015_1_a
Heh. I underestimated ALO's
admins.
Sinon
1440013_19_a
I guess trying to game the system
was a bad idea.
Sinon
1440013_18_a
So I went in with zero research
and got gunned down by a hail of
giant arrows. Yay me.
Sinon
1440013_17_a
Yeah. You'd need the strength of
a Gnome to handle one.
Silica
1440013_16_a
You said it. And Cait Sith are
terrible with ballistae, so using
one to fight back was out.
Sinon
1440013_15_a
I guess a ballista does have way
longer range than any bow, huh?
Silica
1440013_14_a
Oh...
Silica
1440013_13_a
They had a ballista.
Sinon
1440013_12_a
But then, what happened?
Silica
1440013_11_a
That sounds like it could work...
Silica
1440013_10_a
It might have taken forever,
but I should've been able to
solo the whole thing like that...
Sinon
1440013_9_a
I would keep my distance, stay out
of their attack range, and shoot
'em all 'till they were dead.
Sinon
1440013_8_a
That's right. In parlance, I was
going to kite the whole war camp.
Sinon
1440013_7_a
In other words...
You planned on whittling all of
them down from a distance?
Silica
1440013_6_a
Even if there were ranged mobs,
they'd have bows. No bow can
compete with my range.
Sinon
1440013_5_a
Exactly. I had this image that
those sorts of monsters were
primarily melee fighters.
Sinon
1440013_4_a
Demi-humans...
Like goblins and orcs, right?
Silica
1440013_3_a
Silica
1440013_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
It's not like I went in without a
plan. All the quest mobs are
demi-humans, right?
Sinon
1440013_1_a
Wowie... I must say, I'm blown
away by your courage. I could
never do that...
Silica
1440011_17_a
Besides, none of the items I
picked up were useful anyway.
Sinon
1440011_16_a
So the death penalty doesn't
really sting me that much.
Sinon
1440011_15_a
Well, I'm still pretty new here
in ALO.
Sinon
1440011_14_a
Test yourself? Even still,
you're far too reckless...
Silica
1440011_13_a
Heh. Truth is, I wanted to test
myself. I suppose curiosity
killed the cat.
Sinon
1440011_12_a
Why in the world did you try
to solo it?!
Silica
1440011_11_a
Hold up! Everyone's saying that
one's really hard, even for a
whole raid party!
Silica
1440011_10_a
You tried doing that quest solo?!
Silica
1440011_9_a
I tried soloing that new mountain
quest, but it was way too hard.
Sinon
1440011_8_a
What?!
Silica
1440011_7_a
Well...the truth is, I just
respawned. I got killed.
Sinon
1440011_6_a
Um... Sinon? Are you okay?
You seem down.
Silica
1440011_5_a
Yeah, I guess...
Sinon
1440011_4_a
It's been a bit since you
converted your GGO avatar to ALO.
Adjusted to being a Cait Sith yet?
Silica
1440011_3_a
Silica... Hello.
Sinon
1440011_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Good afternoon, Sinon.
Silica
1440011_1_a
Right, right.
Epidanthia
1250028_18_a
E-Epidanthia! Not another word,
or I will KILL you.
Sinon
1250028_17_a
Hehe... Doesn't take much to cheer
you up, does it, Sinon?
Epidanthia
1250028_16_a
Got it!
Kirito
1250028_15_a
A-Anyway, come on! Stop standing
around and help us clear this
area!
Sinon
1250028_14_a
It doesn't?
Kirito
1250028_13_a
Y-You're late, you idiot!
I knew you'd be back, but
you took WAY too long!
Sinon
1250028_12_a
Sinon? Everything all right?
Kirito
1250028_11_a
...
Sinon
1250028_10_a
Then I'm doubly glad I decided
to come back.
Kirito
1250028_9_a
To be honest, it's not going well.
Epidanthia
1250028_8_a
We're still working on our quest.
Without you on the team, we had
to figure out a whole new strat.
Epidanthia
1250028_7_a
Oooh, cool. Glad to have you,
Kiri-poo.
Epidanthia
1250028_6_a
I finished my ALO quest early,
so I thought I'd swing by to give
you two some backup!
Kirito
1250028_5_a
Kirito? What are you doing here?
Sinon
1250028_4_a
Epidanthia
1250028_3_a
Sinon
1250028_2_a
bg_s2_11_cave
Sinon!
Epidanthia!!
Kirito
1250028_1_a
Hehe... I know.
Thanks, Epidanthia. I appreciate it.
Sinon
1250027_33_a
And here I was, worrying about
you and everything!
Epidanthia
1250027_32_a
Whaaat?!
That was just mean!
Epidanthia
1250027_31_a
Hehe... Alright, I'm in. You know,
I'm finally starting to respect
you.
Sinon
1250027_30_a
Cheer up! Let's kill some stuff
and blow off steam!
Epidanthia
1250027_29_a
So stop being so gloomy already,
okay?
Epidanthia
1250027_28_a
Epidanthia...
Sinon
1250027_27_a
Love...is a pretty wonderful
thing, after all.
Epidanthia
1250027_26_a
If moping around about the person
you like makes you weak, then I
don't need to be strong.
Epidanthia
1250027_25_a
It doesn't?
Sinon
1250027_24_a
What are you even talking about?
Of course you're upset. That
doesn't mean you're weak.
Epidanthia
1250027_23_a
I guess...I'm still not strong
enough.
Sinon
1250027_22_a
My head knows I shouldn't be
upset, but my heart's not having
any of it. It's irritating.
Sinon
1250027_21_a
Yup, and yup.
Epidanthia
1250027_20_a
You already knew. Did you HAVE
to make me say it?
Sinon
1250027_19_a
Ahahaha, you finally admitted it!
Epidanthia
1250027_18_a
There. You happy now?
Sinon
1250027_17_a
As you probably guessed, he's
partying with his girlfriend in
ALO.
Sinon
1250027_16_a
Fine. I'm in a bad mood because
Kirito isn't here.
Sinon
1250027_15_a
...
Sinon
1250027_14_a
Can you, like, be any more obvious?
Seriously.
Epidanthia
1250027_13_a
Aww, so cute. She's trying to hide
her embarrassment by getting
angry again.
Epidanthia
1250027_12_a
N-No, I'm not! Are you still going
on about that?! I told you,
you have it wrong!
Sinon
1250027_11_a
Yeaaah, no. You're all sad pandas
because Kiri-poo isn't here.
Epidanthia
1250027_10_a
S-Still don't know what you're
talking about. I'm always like
this.
Sinon
1250027_9_a
Alright, Sinon, admit it.
You're down in the dumps.
Epidanthia
1250027_8_a
...
Sinon
1250027_7_a
Okay!
Epidanthia
1250027_6_a
I'm fine.
Let's just kill it and go.
Sinon
1250027_5_a
Sinon, you all right?
You seem pretty bummed out.
Epidanthia
1250027_4_a
Sure... Let's do it...
Sinon
1250027_3_a
Sinon
1250027_2_a
bg_s2_11_cave
Alllrighty! We finish that baddie,
and we're done here!
Epidanthia
1250027_1_a
...
Sinon
1250025_21_a
Interesting...
Epidanthia
1250025_20_a
It's a two-person party quest,
and he's already got a partner.
Sinon
1250025_19_a
Ahh, that's a shame. You're not
going with him?
Epidanthia
1250025_18_a
He's got some sort of important
quest to do in ALO.
Sinon
1250025_17_a
Heeey, where's Kiri-poo today?
Epidanthia
1250025_16_a
bg_event_ggo_pub
Sorry I'm late, Epidanthia.
Sinon
1250025_15_a
Hmmm... That so, huh...
Epidanthia
1250025_14_a
I was always alone before I met
them. They offered me friendship
and so much more...
Sinon
1250025_13_a
To Kirito's girlfriend, I mean,
and to all of his friends.
Sinon
1250025_12_a
I strongly disagree...
Besides, I'm not just grateful
to him, but to Asuna too.
Sinon
1250025_11_a
In the end, if you like a guy,
you end up LIKE liking a guy.
Know what I mean?
Epidanthia
1250025_10_a
In my opinion, I don't think guys
and girls can have that sort of
relationship.
Epidanthia
1250025_9_a
Grateful? Huh. That so?
Epidanthia
1250025_8_a
Here's the deal. We're friends,
nothing more. Besides, I'm more
grateful to him than anything.
Sinon
1250025_7_a
Grrr... Oh, whatever.
Listen. I don't DISlike Kirito.
Sinon
1250025_6_a
Who, indeed? Ha ha ha!
Epidanthia
1250025_5_a
Who do you think got me riled
up in the first place?
Sinon
1250025_4_a
Cooled off yet?
Epidanthia
1250025_3_a
Epidanthia
1250025_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
Phew...
Sinon
1250025_1_a
Hehe, aww. I never thought you'd
be the type to act like an idiot
over some guy, Sinon.
Epidanthia
1250023_19_a
Wh-What...! Y-You...! Graaar!!
Sinon
1250023_18_a
Oh, forget it. Looking at you
squirm and blush at the same
time just hurts.
Epidanthia
1250023_17_a
Don't get any weird ideas about
us, okay?!
Sinon
1250023_16_a
Wh-What is that supposed
to mean?!
Sinon
1250023_15_a
...Excuse me?!
Sinon
1250023_14_a
It's like THAT, huh?
Epidanthia
1250023_13_a
Ahh. I get it.
Epidanthia
1250023_12_a
Y-Yeah... So there's no way I
could ever go out with him...
Sinon
1250023_11_a
Reaaally now?
Epidanthia
1250023_10_a
Besides...
Kirito's...got a girlfriend.
Sinon
1250023_9_a
H-Hold it right there. Yeah,
I know him in real life, but
we're just friends. Got it?
Sinon
1250023_8_a
You know each other in real life
too, right? It only makes sense
that you'd be together.
Epidanthia
1250023_7_a
Well, with the way you two chat
it up, you totally act like his
clingy girlfriend.
Epidanthia
1250023_6_a
I c-can't believe you'd ask that!
That's the stupidest question
I've ever heard!
Sinon
1250023_5_a
You're not? Reaaally...?
Epidanthia
1250023_4_a
Wh-Why would you even think that?!
Sinon
1250023_3_a
Epidanthia
1250023_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
There's n-no way
we're d-d-dating!
Sinon
1250023_1_a
What are you, crazy?!
Sinon
1250021_21_a
...
Sinon
1250021_20_a
Are you and Kiri-poo going out?
Epidanthia
1250021_19_a
Ask away.
Sinon
1250021_18_a
Good for them. So, Sinon, now
that it's just the two of us...
I've got a question.
Epidanthia
1250021_17_a
Epidanthia
1250021_16_a
Well, those two sure seem to be
getting along.
Sinon
1250021_15_a
Whoa! You're right!
Kirito
1250021_14_a
Well, why not enhance it like so?
That should fit your fighting
style much better.
Orchis
1250021_13_a
Yeah, actually.
Kirito
1250021_12_a
Kirito
1250021_11_a
Kirito, do you have this weapon?
Orchis
1250021_10_a
...
Epidanthia
1250021_9_a
Sinon
1250021_8_a
Y-Yeah, good point...
Kirito
1250021_7_a
We'll never be able to take it out
with our stock of healing items
this low. We need to resupply.
Sinon
1250021_6_a
What are you, crazy? That super
powerful boss spawns in there.
Sinon
1250021_5_a
Ahh, I guess we have...
Alright, let's check the northern
ruins next. Sound good?
Kirito
1250021_4_a
The one that leads from that
underground room, right?
We've been there already.
Sinon
1250021_3_a
Sinon
1250021_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
We haven't explored that tunnel
yet, right?
Kirito
1250021_1_a
Thanks!
Sinon
1250018_30_a
Hehe, that's great!
Good luck, Sinon!
Silica
1250018_29_a
I thought she'd never say that!
Sinon
1250018_28_a
Yes, ma'am!
Sinon
1250018_27_a
Now then, Sinon, where were we?
Oh yes, time to practice your
spellcraft!
Witch
1250018_26_a
Oh, it looks like she's awake.
Silica
1250018_25_a
Ahhh, that was a good nap...
Witch
1250018_24_a
Hnnnh... 
yawn
Witch
1250018_23_a
Hehe, I'm glad!
Silica
1250018_22_a
At first, I really hated this, but
I don't mind working hard now
since I know it pays off!
Sinon
1250018_21_a
That's amazing!
Silica
1250018_20_a
It looks like just spending time
around her earns me EXP.
Sinon
1250018_19_a
No way!
Silica
1250018_18_a
...I've noticed that my magic
skills have actually increased,
bit by bit.
Sinon
1250018_17_a
Even just by cooking and cleaning
and listening to things you
wouldn't think matter at all...
Sinon
1250018_16_a
Really?
Silica
1250018_15_a
Me too... Though, actually, what
she has taught me so far has
helped a lot.
Sinon
1250018_14_a
Hopefully she'll teach you more
advanced stuff soon.
Silica
1250018_13_a
How it's set up, how it's defined,
how to use it. Nothing much more
than that.
Sinon
1250018_12_a
Still just basic stuff, like what
magic is in terms of the world
of ALO.
Sinon
1250018_11_a
That's great! What kind of lessons
is she giving you?
Silica
1250018_10_a
Well, she's finally started
teaching me a little bit about
magic, here and there.
Sinon
1250018_9_a
Hahaha... I take it your pursuit
of magical knowledge is going
the same as before.
Silica
1250018_8_a
Doesn't she? It makes me want to
strangle her, but I don't think
that would get me anywhere.
Sinon
1250018_7_a
Oh, wow... Yeah, she looks pretty
comfortable on that sofa.
Silica
1250018_6_a
I just finished giving her a
massage, so she's finally asleep.
Sinon
1250018_5_a
Hey, where's the witch gone off
to?
Silica
1250018_4_a
Not at all, Silica.
Sinon
1250018_3_a
Sinon
1250018_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Hi, Sinon. Hope you don't mind
me stopping by again today.
Silica
1250018_1_a
Hahaha, hang in there...
Silica
1250017_26_a
Alright, alright.
I should get going.
Sinon
1250017_25_a
Sinon! I'm done eating!
Come rub my shoulders!
Witch
1250017_24_a
Heh heh, exactly.
Sinon
1250017_23_a
That makes sense. It's easier for
you to be satisfied with something
once you figure out how it works.
Silica
1250017_22_a
Once I started thinking of it that
way, I stopped feeling so fed
up with this place.
Sinon
1250017_21_a
They aren't just fairy tales, but
people skilled at a craft based
in science.
Sinon
1250017_20_a
Once I realized that, I realized
something about witches...
Sinon
1250017_19_a
By today's standards, they are,
anyway, since they made medicine
to help people get better.
Sinon
1250017_18_a
The women they called "witches"
in medieval Europe were actually
doctors, right?
Sinon
1250017_17_a
And while I was looking for them,
I remembered something.
Sinon
1250017_16_a
Earlier, the witch sent me out on
an errand to pick some medicinal
herbs in the forest.
Sinon
1250017_15_a
What about now?
Silica
1250017_14_a
And maybe that's why I just
couldn't find the motivation
to work on my magic.
Sinon
1250017_13_a
Maybe that's why I've gotten
so fed up with this world. It
just reeks of fantasy cliche...
Sinon
1250017_12_a
Anyway, you know I'm more used to
games like GGO, right?
Sinon
1250017_11_a
Ahaha...
Silica
1250017_10_a
Though that witch hasn't taught
me a single thing since I
started...
Sinon
1250017_9_a
Yeah, it kinda sucks... But I
decided I'd try to see it through
to the end anyway.
Sinon
1250017_8_a
Oh my gosh, that's terrible!
Silica
1250017_7_a
Just about.
Sinon
1250017_6_a
Don't tell me it's been like this
every day...
Silica
1250017_5_a
Yeah, she's eating the lunch
I made her.
Sinon
1250017_4_a
Is the witch really okay with you
talking to me now?
Silica
1250017_3_a
Silica
1250017_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
Sorry that took so long, Silica.
Sinon
1250017_1_a
O-Of course...
Silica
1250015_28_a
Sorry, Silica, but I'm a little
preoccupied at the moment...
Could you hold on a second?
Sinon
1250015_27_a
Um, what's going on?
Silica
1250015_26_a
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Right away!
Sinon
1250015_25_a
Do the laundry next, Sinon!
And don't forget, you still have
to prepare my meal!
Witch
1250015_24_a
No... I'm fine...
Sinon
1250015_23_a
Sinon, are you okay? I barely
recognize you, you look so
worn out...
Silica
1250015_22_a
...
Sinon
1250015_21_a
How are your magic studies going?
I came to see how you were...
doing... Huh?
Silica
1250015_20_a
Hey, Silica.
Sinon
1250015_19_a
Sinon
1250015_18_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
Sinoooon!
Silica
1250015_17_a
Sinon
1250015_16_a
Ahaha... Good luck with this one.
Kirito
1250015_15_a
I-I'm sorry! Look, I'll start
cleaning right now!
Sinon
1250015_14_a
Enough. You've put me in a foul
mood. I don't believe I can be
bothered taking you as my student.
Witch
1250015_13_a
Hrmph...
I won't abide any back talk!
Witch
1250015_12_a
What?! I came here to learn magic,
not to clean some witch's house!
I mean-some nice witch's...
Sinon
1250015_11_a
Very well then. I think I'll have
you start by cleaning my house.
Witch
1250015_10_a
Yeah, okay.
Sinon
1250015_9_a
She is going to be your teacher,
so maybe you better be a little
more polite...
Kirito
1250015_8_a
Sinon, I think this NPC is able to
hold some degree of improvised
dialog.
Kirito
1250015_7_a
M-My apologies.
Sinon
1250015_6_a
The cheek of you! Were you raised
in a barn? Did no one teach you
to respect your elders?!
Witch
1250015_5_a
Y-Yeah, so what if I do?
Sinon
1250015_4_a
Kirito
1250015_3_a
Sinon
1250015_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Hee hee hee... So you want to be
my apprentice, dearie?
Witch
1250015_1_a
No, not at all.
Kirito
1250013_23_a
You wouldn't mind coming with me
to meet her, would you?
Sinon
1250013_22_a
Well, that's fitting. Sounds like
she'll be able to help me improve.
Sinon
1250013_21_a
The Dread Bastion in the
Halloween event area. The NPC is a
witch who lives deep in the woods.
Kirito
1250013_20_a
I never knew an NPC like that
existed... Where do I need to go?
Sinon
1250013_19_a
And then that player can undertake
a quest to enhance their skills.
Kirito
1250013_18_a
Well, it's an NPC, actually, who
will take on any player who wants
to learn magic as an apprentice.
Kirito
1250013_17_a
Really? Who?
Sinon
1250013_16_a
I just thought of the perfect
person to teach you magic!
Kirito
1250013_15_a
I bet she'd appreciate that...
Oh! Hey!
Kirito
1250013_14_a
Oh... Right, I should probably
wait until she's finished before
asking for help.
Sinon
1250013_13_a
Wait, sorry. I forgot she's super
busy right now working on one
of the Dread Bastion quests...
Kirito
1250013_12_a
Yeah, you're right...
Okay, I'll go find her.
Sinon
1250013_11_a
You'd be better off asking Leafa.
Everyone knows she's a kickass
cleric.
Kirito
1250013_10_a
Well, I'm not exactly the best at
magic either. I'm more of a
physical weapons type of guy...
Kirito
1250013_9_a
Which is why I'm asking you
to teach me, Kirito.
Sinon
1250013_8_a
I see...
Kirito
1250013_7_a
Silica can attest to that, since
I totally botched a new spell
during battle.
Sinon
1250013_6_a
To a certain extent, yes, but I
still can't quite get the hang of
higher level magic...
Sinon
1250013_5_a
Hold on, I thought you already
knew how to do that.
Kirito
1250013_4_a
Yes. I want to be able to
cast spells properly.
Sinon
1250013_3_a
Sinon
1250013_2_a
bg_05_restaurant
You wanna study magic?
Kirito
1250013_1_a
Huh?
Silica
1250011_23_a
Well... Okay, I know exactly
what to do!
Sinon
1250011_22_a
...but I keep putting off honing
my magic skills.
Sinon
1250011_21_a
Since I started playing ALO, I've
gotten pretty decent at using a
bow and flying...
Sinon
1250011_20_a
But...
Silica
1250011_19_a
I haven't been practicing magic
as much as I should.
Sinon
1250011_18_a
That's not true...
It's my fault.
Sinon
1250011_17_a
Besides, I was the one who
couldn't defeat those monsters
in the first place.
Silica
1250011_16_a
H-Honestly, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.
Silica
1250011_15_a
I totally messed up that AOE
spell...
Sinon
1250011_14_a
Silica...
I'm so sorry.
Sinon
1250011_13_a
bg_02_fountain
...
Sinon
1250011_12_a
True...
Alright, I'll see what I can do.
Sinon
1250011_11_a
I know AOE spells aren't always
the strongest, but those monsters
don't have much HP left anyway!
Silica
1250011_10_a
What about casting some sort of
AOE spell? I bet that would be
easier than a bow and arrow!
Silica
1250011_9_a
I can't get a clear shot from here
with all these plants in the way!
Sinon
1250011_8_a
Sinon! What happened?
Silica
1250011_7_a
Gah!
Sinon
1250011_6_a
Steady...
Sinon
1250011_5_a
Yeah, I got this!
Sinon
1250011_4_a
Can you go after them?
Silica
1250011_3_a
Sinon
1250011_2_a
bg_02_forest
Sinon! I just saw a group of
monsters run into that thicket!
Silica
1250011_1_a
Sinon
1240148_21_a
Sure... Good idea!
Leafa
1240148_20_a
Anyhow, let's hunker down
belowdecks until the storm passes.
Sinon
1240148_19_a
Uh...okay?
Leafa
1240148_18_a
Heh. Nope. Nobody up here but
me and the birds.
Sinon
1240148_17_a
By the way, Sinon...
Is someone else up there?
I thought I heard you talking...
Leafa
1240148_16_a
Ah! Okay.
I'll head right down.
Sinon
1240148_15_a
The captain said you're off
lookout duty until the storm
passes!
Leafa
1240148_14_a
What's up, Leafa?
Sinon
1240148_13_a
Hey, Sinon!
Leafa
1240148_12_a
...
Sinon
1240148_11_a
Fly safe! I know we'll meet again!
Sinon
1240148_10_a
Caaaw!
Seagull
1240148_9_a
You need to get somewhere safe
too, before the rain starts...
Sinon
1240148_8_a
I guess that's seagull for
"biscuits, please"?
Sinon
1240148_7_a
Caww!
Seagull
1240148_6_a
Heh. Thanks, seagull.
I couldn't have spotted the storm
without you.
Sinon
1240148_5_a
Caw, caw, caw.
Seagull
1240148_4_a
bg_event_sky_and_sea
Phew...
We made it just in time.
Sinon
1240148_3_a
Aye-aye, cap'n!
Crew Members
1240148_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
Batten down the hatches!
Squall's a-comin'!
Captain
1240148_1_a
That means a huge storm's coming.
I need to warn the crew!
Sinon
1240147_20_a
Wh-What is it
Oh!
Those clouds to the south are
looking really ominous...
Sinon
1240147_19_a
Caww! Caw caww!
Seagull
1240147_18_a
Gah! What?!
Sinon
1240147_17_a
Cawww!!
Seagull
1240147_16_a
...
Sinon
1240147_15_a
...
Sinon
1240147_14_a
Well, back to reading.
Sinon
1240147_13_a
Heh! You guys must've worked
up quite an appetite.
Sinon
1240147_12_a
Caw!!
Seagull
1240147_11_a
Here you go, little guys...
Sinon
1240147_10_a
They aren't supposed to work on
animals, but I bet they taste
pretty good. And you look hungry.
Sinon
1240147_9_a
Hmm... I think I have a few of the
treats I use for beast-taming
lying around...
Sinon
1240147_8_a
Caw, caw!
Seagull
1240147_7_a
You can keep me company while
I read.
Sinon
1240147_6_a
Hehe, sure.
Be my guest.
Sinon
1240147_5_a
Ah, a flock of seagulls...
Want to rest those wings up here?
Sinon
1240147_4_a
What's that?
Sinon
1240147_3_a
Sinon
1240147_2_a
bg_event_sky_and_sea
Caw, caw!
???
1240147_1_a
We're counting on you, Sinon!
Leafa
1240145_26_a
But don't worry. I won't shirk
my lookout duties. I'll keep one
eye on the sea.
Sinon
1240145_25_a
I'll read some novels to pass
the time.
Sinon
1240145_24_a
Oh yeah! I completely forgot
about the e-reader function!
Thanks, Leafa.
Sinon
1240145_23_a
ALO has a plug-in for reading
regular e-books in your downtime.
Leafa
1240145_22_a
Why not catch up on some reading?
Leafa
1240145_21_a
Very. There's nothing to do but
twiddle my thumbs up here. As long
as there's no calamity, anyway.
Sinon
1240145_20_a
Are you bored?
Leafa
1240145_19_a
Thanks! I needed a break
from the monotony.
Sinon
1240145_18_a
Oh, yeah
before I forget!
I brought you some tea!
Leafa
1240145_17_a
Looking at the sea from the sky is
great, sure, but I think I might
prefer this perch to the air.
Sinon
1240145_16_a
I...agree. There's something about
having a swaying deck under your
feet that makes it extra nice.
Sinon
1240145_15_a
It's not quite the same as flying
across the ocean on the way here,
but this view is still wow.
Leafa
1240145_14_a
Yeah.
If you like ocean, that is.
Sinon
1240145_13_a
What an amazing view!
Leafa
1240145_12_a
Really? Aww...
But, still wow!
Leafa
1240145_11_a
Thanks... The only problem is that
there's nothing to do up here.
Sinon
1240145_10_a
I heard you got put up here on
watch, so I thought I'd keep you
company!
Leafa
1240145_9_a
Leafa! What are you doing up here?
Sinon
1240145_8_a
Sinon
1240145_7_a
Hey, Sinoooooon!!
Leafa
1240145_6_a
...
Sinon
1240145_5_a
Now that I've got my bearings,
it's just me and the big blue sea.
Sinon
1240145_4_a
I thought it'd take a while to
learn this, but it's pretty easy
once you've got the basics.
Sinon
1240145_3_a
So I ring the bell like...so.
Sinon
1240145_2_a
bg_event_sky_and_sea
Now let's see...
High waves off...north-northwest.
Sinon
1240145_1_a
I'll just have to make
the most of this.
Sinon
1240143_15_a
...
Sinon
1240143_14_a
W-Wait! B-But...!
Sinon
1240143_13_a
Aye, them's the breaks...
yawn
Speaking of which, time for
me break. Good luck, me heartie!
Crew
1240143_12_a
There are dozens just for
different types of clouds!
Sinon
1240143_11_a
Thanks...
Wait, what the
How many patterns are there?!
Sinon
1240143_10_a
All the patterns be written down
here. Memorize 'em, right quick!
Crew
1240143_9_a
Ring a different pattern depending
on what you see.
Crew
1240143_8_a
If you see anything, pull this
cord to sound the alarm below
on the deck.
Crew
1240143_7_a
Sounds straightforward.
Sinon
1240143_6_a
We also call out if we sight land.
Crew
1240143_5_a
Up here, we keep an eye out for
changes in the winds and the
waves, not to mention other ships.
Crew
1240143_4_a
So brief me on my lookout duties.
What, specifically, am I looking
out for?
Sinon
1240143_3_a
Aye, and our only ship's lookout.
Haven't caught a wink in days,
so I be glad you're here.
Crew
1240143_2_a
bg_event_sky_and_sea
So you're the commanding officer
up here, huh?
Sinon
1240143_1_a
Yuuki
1240141_33_a
Kirito
1240141_32_a
Hang in there, Sinonon!
Asuna
1240141_31_a
I'll go get this over with...
Sinon
1240141_30_a
I guess you're right.
Sinon
1240141_29_a
Asuna
1240141_28_a
Yuuki
1240141_27_a
Yeah, but what can you do?
He's the boss, so we don't get
much of a say...
Kirito
1240141_26_a
Hmph...! Rude! Some captain he is,
judging by appearances! I oughta
give him a piece of my mind...
Sinon
1240141_25_a
Cats like climbing up high,
right? So up you go!
Captain
1240141_24_a
B-But I don't know how to
Sinon
1240141_23_a
Report to the crow's nest!
Captain
1240141_22_a
I hear you got good eyes!
I got just the job for you:
lookout!
Captain
1240141_21_a
Big-ears?!
You didn't just say that.
Sinon
1240141_20_a
Hey, you!
Yeah, you! Big-ears!
Captain
1240141_19_a
...
Captain
1240141_18_a
Asuna
1240141_17_a
Yuuki
1240141_16_a
You're a Cait Sith, Sinon.
Your eyes are the sharpest around!
Kirito
1240141_15_a
Huh? You can't?
But they're right there!
Sinon
1240141_14_a
Kirito
1240141_13_a
Asuna
1240141_12_a
Me neither...
Yuuki
1240141_11_a
Kirito
1240141_9_a
Really? Where?
I don't see anything...
Asuna
1240141_8_a
Yuuki
1240141_10_a
Over there!
A pod of dolphins!
Sinon
1240141_7_a
Yuuki
1240141_6_a
Asuna
1240141_5_a
Hm? What is it, Sinon?
Kirito
1240141_4_a
Hey, look!
Sinon
1240141_3_a
Sinon
1240141_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
(Kirito and his friends found many
adventures waiting for them on
the high seas...)
1240141_1_a
Leafa
1240138_35_a
Silica
1240138_34_a
Hehe, thanks for the compliment.
Sinon
1240138_33_a
The sun may be burning overhead,
but I just got a cold chill...
Kirito
1240138_32_a
Asuna
1240138_31_a
Brrr...
That's our Sinon: ice-cold sniper.
Kirito
1240138_30_a
Silica
1240138_29_a
Hehe, I hope so. That's why I put
the fear of me into him.
Sinon
1240138_28_a
Silica
1240138_27_a
Sinon
1240138_26_a
Ahaha, nice one, Sinon! I bet he's
regretting ever trying to pick you
up, huh?
Leafa
1240138_25_a
Asuna
1240138_24_a
Ha ha, so that's what that was
all about.
Kirito
1240138_23_a
Silica
1240138_22_a
So I worked out some stress.
I must say, it felt oh so good.
Sinon
1240138_21_a
Leafa
1240138_20_a
Silica
1240138_19_a
I saw him hitting on another girl
in the middle of the competition.
It infuriated me.
Sinon
1240138_18_a
Kirito
1240138_17_a
Really?!
Asuna
1240138_16_a
Silica
1240138_15_a
That guy...was the jerk who
hit on me earlier.
Sinon
1240138_14_a
Leafa
1240138_13_a
Silica
1240138_12_a
Hehe, sorry I caused such a stir.
Sinon
1240138_11_a
The audience was dumbfounded.
I think I saw a bunch of people
with their mouths actually agape.
Kirito
1240138_10_a
Yeah, we saw you blast him after
he was already out, like, ten
times.
Kirito
1240138_9_a
Kirito
1240138_8_a
But didn't I see you get into
some kind of fight with a guy?
Asuna
1240138_7_a
Silica
1240138_6_a
Hehe, thanks.
It was surprisingly easy.

You absolutely dominated!

Sinon, congratulations!!
Silica
1240138_1_a
try to use OS as your own
personal hookup app makes me
absolutely furious. Now go. Scoot.
Sinon
1240137_48_a
But I'm serious about my OS
gaming. Unlike you, skirtchaser.
And seeing idiots like you
Sinon
1240137_47_a
This is a free country, so you
can do whatever you like...
Sinon
1240137_46_a
gasp
S-Sorry, I'm sorry! Okay!
I'm leaving, so no more, alright?
Ladies' Man

Sinon
1240137_44_a
Gwaaargh!
N-No, not the fa
GAH!
Ladies' Man
1240137_43_a
Hmm... I'm feeling like a third.
Sinon
1240137_42_a
Well, this is interesting. Shooting
someone after they're out still
triggers the water. I like this.
Sinon
1240137_41_a
Ugaaawh!
Ladies' Man
1240137_40_a
You've really pissed me off, so
here's another one for the road.
Sinon
1240137_39_a
Gah! It's you again!
Ladies' Man
1240137_38_a
You're despicable.
Sinon
1240137_37_a
Wh-What the heck was that?!
Ladies' Man
1240137_36_a
Sinon
1240137_35_a
Hwaaagh?!
Ladies' Man
1240137_34_a
Aw, come on, don't be like that.
This is fate, baby! Destiny!
Ladies' Man
1240137_33_a
Are you kidding me?
You're hitting on me in the
middle of the tournament?!
Female Competitor

Sinon

Hey baby, how about you and I go
out when this event's over?
Ladies' Man

Yeah! I bet she wins this one!

Sinon's in the zone.
Kirito

Hehe, thanks for the compliment.
Sinon
1240137_24_a
And I didn't even realize you had
me in your sights...
Competitor B

W-Wow, you're ridiculously
accurate...
Competitor B

Eeek!
Competitor B

Who's next...?
Sinon

Players hit by water are out!
Please exit the game area!

Yeah, seriously. It makes it easy
to run and easy to hide.

Heh, anyway. Go easy on me out
there, alright, pretty lady?
Ladies' Man
1240135_25_a
It's you, huh? You've got some
nerve trying to flirt with me
again.
Sinon
1240135_24_a
Hmph!
Sinon

H-Hey!

Hey there, pretty lady. Wanna come
grab some food with us when this

Sinon
1240135_20_a
Asuna
1240135_19_a
Anyway, come on, guys.
Let's go find some good seats.
Kirito
1240135_18_a
That's our Sinon.
She's so confident!
Silica

Silica
1240135_16_a
Asuna
1240135_15_a
Sinon said, "Water guns? Please.
You think I'll let myself get hit?
Hah!" Then she marched off, ha ha.
Kirito
1240135_14_a
Apparently the fact that you get
shot with water is the big draw
here. It makes it more real.
Leafa
1240135_13_a
Leafa
1240135_12_a
Hehe, I can't wait to see people
get blasted! You can only get this
kind of show at an OS-linked pool!
Liz
1240135_11_a
Gets a powerful jet of actual
water shot at them. Cool, right?
Kirito
1240135_9_a
Silica
1240135_10_a
Whoever gets shot in OS...
Kirito
1240135_8_a
Yup. From what I read, it's just
a normal PvP match...with one
twist.
Kirito
1240135_7_a
So Sinonon's going to compete?
Asuna
1240135_6_a
This is a battle royale! Last one
standing wins! There's only one
restriction: guns only!

Everyone ready? It's time to
start this pool's OS mini-event!
Announcer
1240135_1_a
Wait a sec, this is
Sinon
1240133_14_a
Right here.
Kirito
1240133_13_a
Really? Let me see...
Sinon
1240133_12_a
Hmm... Oh, look here. A gun-only
mini-event is starting over at
that pool.
Kirito
1240133_11_a
They just finished a big event,
so I doubt it... Still, it's worth
a check.
Kirito
1240133_10_a
Speaking of OS...any interesting
events going on? I need something
to take my mind off those creeps.
Sinon
1240133_9_a
Hahaha... You realize this is the
real world, right? Not GGO or OS.
Kirito
1240133_8_a
I dropped a smoke bomb and legged
it, but I was so pissed I could've
stuck a pistol in that guy's face.
Sinon
1240133_7_a
Happy to help. I heard you got
hit on. I guess those sorts of
guys hang around pools, huh?
Kirito
1240133_6_a
Well, I'm happy you did.
Now I get you as my own
personal flirtguard.
Sinon
1240133_5_a
I should've stretched, yeah, but
I still can't believe I pulled a leg
muscle... Owww...
Kirito
1240133_4_a
Heh, it's your own fault. You
should've stretched before
you got in the water.

seen him since we tipped his

Yeah, he'll keep us
hold on!
Where's Kirito?!
He's not here!
Silica
1240131_30_a
Asuna
1240131_29_a
Silica
1240131_28_a
I heard that too. But that's
why Kirito's here, right?
Sinon
1240131_27_a
Leafa
1240131_26_a
Apparently guys on the prowl try
to hit on girls who are alone or in
all-girl groups...

1240131_25_a
Asuna
1240131_24_a
Silica
1240131_23_a
Yeah, and he was an irritating
pest. I told him in no uncertain
terms "no" and left him stewing.

Whoa! Sinon!
Someone was hitting on you?!
Leafa

Silica

Hmm... Splashing around like an
idiot isn't really my scene, but
it's better than getting hit on.
Sinon
1240131_18_a
Sinonon! Come and play with us!
Asuna
1240131_17_a
Sinon? Weren't you off reading
a book?

P-Please have mercy...
Shooting Gallery Attendant
1240128_23_a
Yep! Every last one
in the stall!
Sinon
1240128_22_a
But now you can win
ALL the prizes!
Seven
1240128_21_a
Ha ha! Yeah, that was lucky!
Sinon
1240128_20_a
It takes AR tech to
accomplish that!
Kirito
1240128_19_a
You couldn't normally ask a
carnival game to move the
targets and up the difficulty.
Kirito
1240128_18_a
And we can thank this Ordinal
Scale mini-game for that!
Kirito
1240128_17_a
But now that I know about
kinetic vision, I can work
it to my advantage after all.
Sinon
1240128_16_a
Yeah, thanks! I feel like I
was starting to doubt myself
for a while there...
Sinon
1240128_15_a
Thanks for that, Seven!
Kirito
1240128_14_a
Now that they're in motion,
your kinetic vision kicks in
and you're all set!
Seven
1240128_13_a
You were unconsciously
compensating for the unmoving
targets and aiming there.
Seven
1240128_12_a
Just as I thought!
Sinon has no problem now that
the targets are in motion!
Seven
1240128_11_a
Now that they've raised the
difficulty of the game, you're
hitting all of them, Sinon!
Kirito
1240128_10_a
I did it again!
Sinon
1240128_9_a
...!
Sinon
1240128_8_a
3, 2, 1! Pull!
Sinon
1240128_7_a
gulp
... A bull's-eye?!
B-But you couldn't hit
anything before...!
Shooting Gallery Attendant
1240128_6_a
You hit it!
Kirito
1240128_5_a
Aha!
Sinon
1240128_4_a
Seven
1240128_3_a
Kirito
1240128_2_a
bg_event_festival
...!
Sinon
1240128_1_a
I'd like to try a little
experiment...
Seven
1240127_33_a
Hmm?
What can I do for you?
Shooting Gallery Attendant
1240127_32_a
That's my hypothesis!
Now to test it out...
Excuse me, mister!
Seven
1240127_31_a
Bullet Line Prediction...?
Ha ha! That sounds silly, but
I guess it sums up the idea.
Seven
1240127_30_a
I-I don't know about that...
Sinon
1240127_29_a
But you've got something
like that just by instinct!
That's incredible, Sinon!
Kirito
1240127_28_a
You were pretty handy with
Bullet Line, Kirito...
Sinon
1240127_27_a
Makes sense! Like a built-in
version of the Bullet Line
Prediction system in GGO!
Kirito
1240127_26_a
...!
Kirito
1240127_25_a
based on the current
position, and aiming there. A
still target throws you off!
Seven
1240127_24_a
Think of it like this! Good
kinetic vision means your
brain makes a prediction
Seven
1240127_23_a
So if you've got good kinetic
vision, you can't hit a
bull's-eye? I don't get it...
Sinon
1240127_22_a
Landing a hit depends on
sensing where the target is
going to be, not where it is.
Seven
1240127_21_a
Think about a sniper aiming
for a moving target.
Seven
1240127_20_a
Kinetic vision...?
Kirito
1240127_19_a
What I mean is you've got
a good sense of kinetic
vision!
Seven
1240127_18_a
That's not what I mean, silly!
VRMMOs compensate for
nearsighted players anyway.
Seven
1240127_17_a
Well, my glasses are
accessories, but my eyes
aren't that keen or--
Sinon
1240127_16_a
Huh...?
Kirito
1240127_15_a
...I hypothesize that your
eyes are too good!
Seven
1240127_14_a
So if it's not your
technique...
Seven
1240127_13_a
N-No, not really.
Sinon
1240127_12_a
And do you have anything
like a hand tremor when
you try to take aim?
Seven
1240127_11_a
Right...
Sinon
1240127_10_a
Hmmm... I think I'd still
class that as a mid- to
long-range weapon.
Seven
1240127_9_a
Right... But I wield a
spear from time to time in
ALO without any trouble.
Sinon
1240127_8_a
because you're used to
working at a distance.
Am I correct?
Seven
1240127_7_a
Who said anything about jokes?
Sinon! You're having trouble
hitting close range targets
Seven
1240127_6_a
Calm down, Seven.
We're not in the
mood for jokes.
Kirito
1240127_5_a
Allow Professor Nanairo
Arshavin to solve this
predicament...with SCIENCE!
Seven
1240127_4_a
Sinon
1240127_3_a
Kirito
1240127_2_a
bg_event_festival
... Aha! I think I understand!
Seven
1240127_1_a
Huh?
What's wrong?
You guys look miserable...
Seven
1240125_16_a
Oh... Hi, Seven.
Kirito
1240125_15_a
Kirito
1240125_14_a
Hey, you guys!
Didja try the new shooting
gallery?
Seven
1240125_13_a
O-Oh, okay... Good to hear.
Kirito
1240125_12_a
L-Look, it's not about what
happened when I was a kid! I
just misjudged the distance!
Sinon
1240125_11_a
Sinon, I was thinking...
Kirito
1240125_10_a
It's just a guess. I'm not
sure, myself...
Sinon
1240125_9_a
Huh. I guess that makes sense.
Kirito
1240125_8_a
I must've missed because my
eyes couldn't adjust to the
far shorter ranges here.
Sinon
1240125_7_a
I was hitting targets a mile
away in GGO. Even in ALO, my
range is a few hundred yards.
Sinon
1240125_6_a
Huh...?
Kirito
1240125_5_a
The targets back there were
way too close for me...
Sinon
1240125_4_a
In VRMMOs, I usually focus
on long-range weapons.
Sinon
1240125_3_a
Kirito
1240125_2_a
bg_event_festival
I think I know.
Sinon
1240125_1_a
About that...
Sinon
1240123_22_a
Yeah, I know... Which is why
I, um...was just wondering
what threw you off.
Kirito
1240123_21_a
Me? I'm fine. You saw me in
that last event battle,
didn't you...?
Sinon
1240123_20_a
Are you not feeling well
today, Sinon?
Kirito
1240123_19_a

Sinon
1240123_18_a
Sinon...?
Kirito
1240123_17_a

Sinon
1240123_16_a
You missed again?!
Kirito
1240123_15_a
...!
Sinon
1240123_14_a
Second round. Ready, aim...
Sinon
1240123_13_a
Th-That was just practice,
right, Sinon?
Kirito
1240123_12_a
Aw, what a shame!
But no worries!
Ready for round 2?
Shooting Gallery Attendant
1240123_11_a

Sinon

Kirito
1240123_9_a

Sinon
1240123_7_a
Hmmm...?
Kirito
1240123_6_a
Here goes...
Sinon
1240123_5_a
Ha ha! You can count
on that with Sinon here!
Kirito
1240123_4_a
Sinon
1240123_3_a
Kirito
1240123_2_a
bg_event_festival
Ready, sharpshooters?
Take those guns and
aim for a bull's-eye!
Shooting Gallery Attendant
1240123_1_a
Uh, sure! Let's go...
Kirito
1240121_14_a
Do you know the way?
Sinon
1240121_13_a
Well, anyway.
I guess there's no harm
in checking it out.
Sinon
1240121_12_a
Huh?
Kirito
1240121_11_a
It's not that simple...
Sinon
1240121_10_a
You think it'd be too easy for
you? That just means you'd be
a shoo-in for the top prize!
Kirito
1240121_9_a
Oh. Cool.
Sinon
1240121_8_a
As soon as I saw it,
I thought of you, Sinon!
Kirito
1240121_7_a
It's incredible!
The graphics are so immersive,
I got chills!
Kirito
1240121_6_a
Oh, yeah? How is it?
Sinon
1240121_5_a
I wanted to tell you! They
upgraded the AR shooting
gallery down on the midway!
Kirito
1240121_4_a
Hmm? What is it?
Sinon
1240121_3_a
Sinon
1240121_2_a
bg_event_festival
Oh, that's right...!
Kirito
1240121_1_a
We'll be rooting for you!
Suguha
1240118_19_a
I'll be back on top in no time!
Sinon
1240118_18_a
Okay. Tell them not to worry.
Sinon
1240118_17_a
I'm gonna go back to
Liz and Silica.
Suguha
1240118_16_a
Ha ha. Guess I don't need to
worry anymore, then.
Suguha
1240118_15_a
Don't worry. I'll make sure
their HP is down to zero by
the time they get here.
Sinon
1240118_14_a
They must have realized that they
can't hit us from so far away.
Suguha
1240118_13_a
I think the ship's coming closer.
Suguha
1240118_12_a
Sinon, be careful.
Suguha
1240118_11_a
Two to go!
Sinon
1240118_10_a
Hehe, and that's just what
makes Sinon so good!
Suguha
1240118_9_a
Yeah. Not to mention they're
moving targets on the water...
Player B
1240118_8_a
I know I'm the one who suggested
attacking them, but I didn't think
you'd get one on your first shot!
Player A
1240118_7_a
Thanks! And also thanks for
warning me when they shot at us!
Sinon
1240118_6_a
Whoa, that was amazing!
Suguha
1240118_5_a
Got one!
Sinon
1240118_4_a
Grawwwh!

1240118_3_a
Suguha
1240118_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Get ready to be destroyed!
Sinon
1240118_1_a
Hehehe... If it's a fight they
want, it's a fight they'll get...
Sinon
1240117_35_a
Are they trying to take us out
of the fight as a precaution?
Sounds like overkill!
Player B
1240117_34_a
Yeah! I saw a bullet animation
coming from just over the water!
Suguha
1240117_33_a
Gah! What in the world was that?!
Did it come from the ship?!
Sinon
1240117_32_a
Wait... What's that sound...?
Oh, crap! Sinon, get down!
Suguha
1240117_31_a
But is it fair to attack them
when they haven't done anything
to us?
Sinon
1240117_30_a
I actually thought of that...
Sinon
1240117_29_a
So should we start shooting at
them instead of the DBAs?
Player B
1240117_28_a
for all sorts of personal and
political reasons...
Player A
1240117_27_a
According to this game's story, we
Adapts are supposed to have a lot
of infighting going on,
Player A
1240117_26_a
OS recommends PvP play,
just like ALO.
Player A
1240117_25_a
Huh?
Sinon
1240117_24_a
Hey. Do you think we're allowed
to attack them?
Player A
1240117_23_a
Argh, I didn't even consider
that...!
Suguha
1240117_22_a
Yup... They get to aim from so
close. It puts the rest of us at
a terrible disadvantage.
Sinon
1240117_21_a
Are there event participants on
that thing?!
Suguha
1240117_20_a
Huh?
Suguha
1240117_19_a
Whoa, it's a ship...
Suguha
1240117_18_a
THAT happened!
Sinon
1240117_17_a
What happened?
Suguha
1240117_16_a
Leafa...
Sinon
1240117_15_a
Sinooooon!
Suguha
1240117_14_a
Jeez... So, you gotta be rich to
win? Give me a break! This is
ridiculous!
Player B
1240117_13_a
Considering they'd go so far as
to bring a cruiser, there's really
nothing we can do at this point...
Player A
1240117_12_a
Ugh...
Sinon
1240117_11_a
Alright, Leafa. Let us know
what's going on.
Liz
1240117_9_a
Silica
1240117_10_a
I-I'm gonna go see what's
going on!
Suguha
1240117_8_a
What?! How did that happen?
Liz
1240117_7_a
Sinon's down to 4th place!
Silica
1240117_6_a
Look at the rankings!
They've just been refreshed...
Silica
1240117_5_a
What's wrong, Silica?
Suguha
1240117_4_a
Liz
1240117_3_a
Suguha
1240117_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Oh no!
Silica
1240117_1_a
Though, I doubt the devs could
predict that someone would sail
out on a ship...
Sinon
1240115_24_a
Actually, there are no such
restrictions in this event.
Sinon
1240115_23_a
Isn't that against the rules?!
Player A
1240115_22_a
Yeah, I bet that's what
they're planning...
Sinon
1240115_21_a
That's not fair! From that
distance, they could shoot them
down before anyone else!
Player B
1240115_20_a
What the...?! There are players
on that ship!
Sinon
1240115_19_a
It looks like a cruiser's going
out to sea...
Player A
1240115_18_a
Hm? What's going on? People are
yelling over there.
Sinon
1240115_17_a
H-Hey! Look!
???
1240115_16_a
Yeah, I bet...
Player B
1240115_15_a
The movements are a little
different here, but the experience
definitely helped.
Sinon
1240115_14_a
I was a gunner in a VRMMO.
Sinon
1240115_13_a
I've never seen such accurate
shots in an AR game before.
Player B
1240115_12_a
Well, I make sure that every
one counts.
Sinon
1240115_11_a
Impressive! I bet you hardly
wasted any bullets.
Player A
1240115_10_a
Phew...
Sinon
1240115_9_a
Suguha
1240115_8_a
Silica
1240115_7_a
I don't think anyone could catch
up to her at this point...
Liz
1240115_6_a
Look how many more points she has
than the gunner in second place!
Liz
1240115_5_a
Of course. It's Sinon...
Suguha
1240115_4_a
Liz
1240115_3_a
Suguha
1240115_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Amazing! She's in first place!
Silica
1240115_1_a
Oh, yeah!
Suguha
1240113_19_a
Hey guys. Why don't we take a
look at Sinon's score?
Liz
1240113_18_a
At least, watching all those
DBAs drop from the sky reminds
me of one.
Silica
1240113_17_a
Ha ha, yeah. Or a puzzle game.
Silica
1240113_16_a
So it's like a glorified carnival
shooting game.
Suguha
1240113_15_a
The point of this event is for
gunners to show off their skills,
after all.
Liz
1240113_14_a
They do, but I don't think they
can make it all the way to the
players.
Liz
1240113_13_a
Do they attack players too?
Silica
1240113_12_a
Geez! Can you believe how many
monsters are getting shot down!
Suguha
1240113_11_a
Graaaahh!!
Monster
1240113_10_a
Sure, it's pretty if you don't
look at the creepy-crawly
monsters in the sky.
Liz
1240113_9_a
It looks like fireworks when so
many of them go off at once.
That really is pretty, hehe.
Silica
1240113_8_a
Those are bullet animations,
right?
Silica
1240113_7_a
Whoa, the sky's so beautiful.
Suguha
1240113_6_a
Wow, listen to that crowd!
The event must have just started!
Liz
1240113_5_a
Silica
1240113_4_a
Suguha
1240113_3_a
Liz
1240113_2_a
bg_event_seashore
YEEEAAH!! WHOOOO!
???
1240113_1_a
We're rooting for you, Sinon!
Silica
1240111_19_a
Hehe, I gotta agree with you
there. Well, I should get going.
I think it's about to start.
Sinon
1240111_18_a
It's really exciting to limit the
equipment type and hold the
quest over the actual ocean.
Liz
1240111_17_a
Yeah. I'm impressed with how
well the devs were able to take
advantage of the AR platform.
Liz
1240111_16_a
Sounds like a fun quest!
Suguha
1240111_15_a
Yup. And players are awarded
points based on how many they
shoot down.
Sinon
1240111_14_a
and you guys are supposed to
shoot them down with guns or
bows and arrows, right?
Liz
1240111_13_a
So for this event, a swarm of
flying DBAs is going to appear
above the water,
Liz
1240111_12_a
Hehe, thanks.
Sinon
1240111_11_a
It's okay. We still wanted to
come watch you be amazing!
Silica
1240111_10_a
Yup. That's why you guys can't
join me, unfortunately.
Sinon
1240111_9_a
There's going to be a gunner-
exclusive quest in this harbor
today, right?
Suguha
1240111_8_a
Yeah. It's not every day you see
that many firearms-wielding
players in one place.
Sinon
1240111_7_a
Wow... That sure is a lot of
people.
Liz
1240111_6_a
I can't wait to try out my new
gun. I just got it yesterday!
Player B
1240111_5_a
Suguha
1240111_4_a
Sinon
1240111_3_a
Liz
1240111_2_a
bg_event_seashore
I'm gonna get the highest score
today.
Player A
1240111_1_a
Uh... Excuse me?
Kirito
1240108_25_a
It's NOTHING! It's not like I'm
thinking I just totally blew the
chance of a lifetime or anything!!
Sinon
1240108_24_a
Why's your face so red?
Kirito
1240108_23_a
Hey, are you okay, Sinon?
Kirito
1240108_22_a
Y-Y-You and I w-w-would've...
k-k-k-ki
Sinon
1240108_21_a
Wh-Which means...if I just
followed the script, then...
Sinon
1240108_20_a
Well... Yeah, I guess. Why?
Kirito
1240108_19_a
Y-You were the PRINCE?!
Sinon
1240108_18_a
Then suddenly I get a message
saying I finished the Snow White
story. I was crazy confused.
Kirito
1240108_17_a
So I figured I was part of a fairy
tale, and came into the forest to
see what I had to do.
Kirito
1240108_16_a
A second ago this NPC told me
I was the prince.
Kirito
1240108_15_a
Y-Yeah...
Sinon
1240108_14_a
Let me guess...
You killed the queen, right?
Kirito
1240108_13_a
Y-Yeah, seems that way...
Sinon
1240108_12_a
Ah, I thought that was you!
So, you're Snow White, huh?
Kirito
1240108_11_a
Huh?! Is that...K-Kirito?!
Sinon
1240108_9_a
Kirito
1240108_10_a
Sinnnooonnn!
Hey, Siiinon!!
???
1240108_8_a
Wh-What's going to happen now that
I messed up the story?!
Sinon
1240108_7_a
And then he wakes her up with a...
Gah! A k-k-kiss!!
Sinon
1240108_6_a
Then the prince shows up...
Sinon
1240108_5_a
S-So the next part of the story is
that Snow White falls into a
deep sleep...
Sinon
1240108_4_a
UGH! I got so worked up
I accidentally killed her.
Sinon
1240108_3_a
Sinon
1240108_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Gnnrk... No... I cannot die...
Nooo!
Crone
1240108_1_a
Nnngh!!!
Crone
1240107_24_a
Listen, idiot. I know who you are!
If you don't want an arrow through
your skull, remove your disguise!
Sinon
1240107_23_a
...!
Crone
1240107_22_a
I'm at the end of my rope here...
Sinon
1240107_21_a
Do I really have to put up with
this garbage?
Sinon
1240107_20_a
First I have to let a weakling
beat me, then do chores, and now
I have to listen to this tripe...
Sinon
1240107_19_a
Would you care for one?
The first is free!
Crone
1240107_18_a
Grr...
Sinon
1240107_17_a
My apples are quite good for you.
I guarantee they will enhance
your already considerable beauty.
Crone
1240107_16_a
I'm just an old woman who travels
this area selling apples.
Crone
1240107_15_a
...!
Sinon
1240107_14_a
Sinon
1240107_13_a
bg_18_mountain
My oh my, I never expected to meet
such a fair maiden living so deep
in the woods.
???
1240107_12_a
I'm going to kill these stupid
dwarfs...
Sinon
1240107_11_a
And after that...
Dwarf G
1240107_10_a
And after that is lunch!
Make it good!
Dwarf F
1240107_9_a
Then picking weeds, don't forget!
Dwarf E
1240107_8_a
Then mucking out the eaves!
Dwarf D
1240107_7_a
Then laundry!
Dwarf C
1240107_6_a
But before chores comes breakfast!
Cook, I say!
Dwarf B
1240107_5_a
Come, Snow White!
Your chores await!
Dwarf A
1240107_4_a
Ugh... This event is really
pissing me off...
Sinon
1240107_3_a
If I remember right, next the
queen disguises herself as a crone
and sells her a poison apple.
Sinon
1240107_2_a
bg_21_alne_inn
Hmph. Well I've gotten into doing
their chores in exchange for
their
shudder
hospitality...
Sinon
1240107_1_a
Gah, these idiots need to shut up.
I've never met anyone so
irritating before...
Sinon
1240105_23_a
Ha ha ha! Friends, let us keep
things friendly now!
Dwarf G
1240105_22_a
Bah, hogwash! You would spin
demons out of dandelions! She is
what she says she is, no more!
Dwarf F
1240105_21_a
She lies? The fiend! Are all girls
this villainous?!
Dwarf E
1240105_20_a
No no no, I must protest! You are
all being deceived, I say!
She lies to take advantage of us!
Dwarf D
1240105_19_a
Hear hear! Sanctuary for the
poor girl!
Dwarf C
1240105_18_a
Horrible! Horrendous! Dreadful!
Let her stay, say I!
Dwarf B
1240105_17_a
Your mother seeks your head?!
Dwarf A
1240105_16_a
Please, I beg of you.
May I shelter here for a time?
Sinon
1240105_15_a
Excuse me. I have fled here, for
my wicked mother is after my head.
Sinon
1240105_14_a
But if I remember the story right,
I have to beg them for help. Ick.
Sinon
1240105_13_a
These dwarfs...are something else.
I don't think I can match their
weird excitement here...
Sinon
1240105_12_a
Friends! True friends!
A lovely thing!
Dwarf G
1240105_11_a
Of course, why not! We are all
friends, this is true. Friends
share many things, even illusions!
Dwarf F
1240105_10_a
But if that's true, isn't it odd
for us all to see the same?
Dwarf E
1240105_9_a
No no, I must protest! 'Tis a
mirage! An illusion! No girl
would be here, I say!
Dwarf D
1240105_8_a
I haven't laid eyes upon a lady
in years!
Dwarf C
1240105_7_a
You're right! A fair forest
damsel, say I!
Dwarf B
1240105_6_a
Hey there, ho there! Do my eyes
deceive me? A lady it is, indeed!
Dwarf A
1240105_5_a
Wait, is that a happy-go-lucky
tune my ears hear?
Sinon
1240105_4_a
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho!
???
1240105_3_a
Come to think of it, isn't this
where Snow White meets the
Seven Dwarfs?
Sinon
1240105_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Hey, look. There's a tiny hut
out here in the forest.
Sinon
1240105_1_a
Hmph, guess there's no use arguing
with an NPC. Fine, I'll flee.
Thanks.
Sinon
1240103_18_a
What will you do, my lady?
Hunter NPC
1240103_17_a
Still... Why'd it take you so long
to tell me this, huh?! I'm at
half health here!
Sinon
1240103_16_a
Interesting. Running isn't my
style, but I guess I should follow
the story.
Sinon
1240103_15_a
I shall tell Her Majesty that I
slew you with my very hands, so I
beg of thee! Flee into the forest!
Hunter NPC
1240103_14_a
So...we're doing Snow White now?
Sinon
1240103_13_a
And it was you who appeared in the
mirror, not her. She flew into
a jealous rage.
Hunter NPC
1240103_12_a
I heard that the queen asked her
magic mirror to show her the
fairest of them all...
Hunter NPC
1240103_11_a
But the queen
your mother
she
ordered your death. I could not
disobey her!
Hunter NPC
1240103_10_a
You coulda fooled me!
Sinon
1240103_9_a
I didn't want to kill you...
Hunter NPC
1240103_8_a
Yeah? Spit it out already.
Sinon
1240103_7_a
The truth is...
Hunter NPC
1240103_6_a
Finally. I'm almost at half
health...
Sinon
1240103_5_a
Your attacks are too pathetic to
hurt, but playing the part of a
pincushion is getting annoying.
Sinon
1240103_4_a
sigh
Yeah, yeah, I'd be happy to.
Can we hurry this up?
Sinon
1240103_3_a
Sinon
1240103_2_a
bg_18_mountain
D-Die!
Hunter NPC
1240103_1_a
sigh
I'm already disgusted
with this event.
Sinon
1240101_19_a
He's repeating himself... Don't
tell me this is a scripted battle
where I have to LOSE to this fool?
Sinon
1240101_18_a
D-Die!
Hunter NPC
1240101_17_a
He didn't lose any HP?
What's going on here?
Sinon
1240101_16_a
D-Die!
Hunter NPC
1240101_15_a
Bullseye... Huh?!
Sinon
1240101_14_a
Nnrk!!
Hunter NPC
1240101_13_a
Let me show you how it's done!
Sinon
1240101_12_a
Hmph. This guy doesn't even know
how to nock his bow properly.
Sinon
1240101_11_a
D-Die!
Hunter NPC
1240101_10_a
Hmm... He looks like an NPC,
and he's dressed like a hunter...
Sinon
1240101_9_a
Wh-What's with this guy? Only an
ill-bred lout would ambush
a lady.
Sinon
1240101_8_a
Bah! I missed?!
???
1240101_7_a
What the?!
Sinon
1240101_6_a
W-Waaagh!
???
1240101_5_a
This is irritating. 
sigh
...
Might as well try to find a fairy
tale on my own.
Sinon
1240101_4_a
Checking my friend list won't help
either. The friend locater is
disabled in this area.
Sinon
1240101_3_a
Where did everyone go? They have
to be somewhere here on Grimm
Island...
Sinon
1240101_2_a
bg_18_mountain
sigh
...
I'm lost.
Sinon
1240101_1_a
Of course, Sinon!
Asuna
1240098_22_a
Will you wait for me?
Sinon
1240098_21_a
I'm going to get so buff and prove
to everyone that I can keep up
in OS either way.
Sinon
1240098_20_a
Secret...? Sure, whatever.
Call it what you want.
Sinon
1240098_19_a
Yep. It'll be our secret.
Asuna
1240098_18_a
You know you can't tell Kirito and
the others ANY of what we just
talked about, right?
Sinon
1240098_17_a
Heh...
Asuna
1240098_16_a
That's why I didn't tell anyone!
It felt so selfish.
Sinon
1240098_15_a
I mean, I didn't do ALL of this
for you guys. I did it for myself,
so I wouldn't be embarrassed!
Sinon
1240098_14_a
Whenever you thought about playing
OS, you were also thinking about
us.
Asuna
1240098_13_a
Come again?
Sinon
1240098_12_a
I'm kind of glad to hear that.
Asuna
1240098_11_a
Sinonon...
Asuna
1240098_10_a
And then there's me-the bookworm.
I didn't think I'd be able to
keep up.
Sinon
1240098_9_a
Easy for you to say, since you
work out. Even Liz and the others
are pretty fit for gamers.
Sinon
1240098_8_a
You certainly didn't need to go
that far with it...
Asuna
1240098_7_a
Whoa! You're taking this workout
thing pretty seriously, huh?
Asuna
1240098_6_a
And I figured I'd not only be able
to get the Augma, but nice running
clothes and shoes too.
Sinon
1240098_5_a
More or less. I figured the more
I worked, the more fit I'd get.
Sinon
1240098_4_a
So you could train up for OS?
Asuna
1240098_3_a
Sinon
1240098_2_a
bg_18_mountain
So I got a really physical job.
Asuna
1240098_1_a
Sinonon...
Asuna
1240097_38_a
That's what was going through my
head.
Sinon
1240097_37_a
Why would I be any good at a game
that suddenly demands I move
around all the time?
Sinon
1240097_36_a
And I've liked to read books ever
since I was young. I'm an
introvert-a homebody.
Sinon
1240097_35_a
Ah, I see...
True, OS does rely a lot on
your ability to get around.
Asuna
1240097_34_a
You're actually you, running
around. I thought my own physical
limitations would hold me back.
Sinon
1240097_33_a
Augmented or not, it's still
reality, you know?
Sinon
1240097_32_a
Okay... I'll come clean. When
I first heard about AR games,
I thought it was scary.
Sinon
1240097_31_a
And how could that be related to
how fast you got here?
I'm officially confused.
Asuna
1240097_30_a
Besides wanting to play OS with
everyone?
Asuna
1240097_29_a
There's another reason I've been
working really hard.
Sinon
1240097_28_a
What?
Asuna
1240097_27_a
sigh
It's just...you know...
Sinon
1240097_26_a
REALLY fast.
Asuna
1240097_25_a
Well, I, um...flew really fast.
Sinon
1240097_24_a
When you said you'd be 30 minutes
late, I thought for sure you'd
actually be an hour late.
Asuna
1240097_23_a
The town you spawned in was 30
minutes from here, wasn't it?
Asuna
1240097_22_a
Sorry?
Sinon
1240097_21_a
Sinonon, I can't help but wonder
how you made it here so fast.
Asuna
1240097_20_a
Whew. That takes care of them.
Sinon
1240097_19_a
You bet!
Asuna
1240097_18_a
Let's kick the stuffing out of
these guys, shall we?
Sinon
1240097_17_a
Hey! Did you forget about us?!
Quit yapping already!
Enemy NPC
1240097_16_a
No! That's not what I meant
at all!
Asuna
1240097_15_a
Sorry, you're right. I was late.
I shouldn't berate you.
Sinon
1240097_14_a
Heh. I figured I could handle it
on my own, so I-
Asuna
1240097_13_a
Why'd you try to tackle this solo?
I would've gone with you if you
had waited...
Sinon
1240097_12_a
Sinonon! You came!
Asuna
1240097_11_a
I just made it.
Sinon
1240097_9_a
Asuna
1240097_10_a
Huh?!
Asuna
1240097_8_a
Bleargh!
Enemy NPC
1240097_7_a
What?! Where were the rest of them
hiding?!
Asuna
1240097_6_a
This one's nearly dead!
Enemy NPC
1240097_5_a
You think you can beat me?!
Asuna
1240097_4_a
Unf!
Asuna
1240097_3_a
Asuna
1240097_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Die!!!
Enemy NPC
1240097_1_a
Yep. Bye!
Sinon
1240095_27_a
Okay, I'll let you go.
See you tonight!
Asuna
1240095_26_a
You're still working, even after
starting OS? Wow.
Asuna
1240095_25_a
Unfortunately I've gotta go to
work now. I'll talk to you later
tonight in ALO, okay?
Sinon
1240095_24_a
Hehe, it's okay.
Sinon
1240095_23_a
Sorry, there I go again.
Asuna
1240095_22_a
Oh no? Then why did you-?
Asuna
1240095_21_a
I... I don't really mind. Besides,
that's not why I didn't say
anything.
Sinon
1240095_20_a
We should've been more considerate
when we were making a huge deal
out of it.
Asuna
1240095_19_a
I'm sorry, Sinon. We all got the
Augma for free as students at the
Survivors' School.
Asuna
1240095_18_a
So THAT'S why you were so busy...
Asuna
1240095_17_a
That way I'd be able to take a
bunch of time off once the game
launched.
Sinon
1240095_16_a
I didn't want to cause any trouble
at work, so I took a bunch of
shifts early on.
Sinon
1240095_15_a
You what...?
Asuna
1240095_14_a
Actually... I've been preparing
for this ever since you all said
you were going to play together.
Sinon
1240095_13_a
I've turned around and done
exactly what I told Kirito not
to do.
Asuna
1240095_12_a
I'm sorry, that was rude. You
don't have to tell me if you
don't want to.
Asuna
1240095_11_a
...
Sinon
1240095_10_a
Really? Why didn't you tell us?
Asuna
1240095_9_a
Yeah, just today...
Sinon
1240095_8_a
So you've started playing OS too?
Asuna
1240095_7_a
...
Sinon
1240095_6_a
It IS you! I just happened to
see you.
Asuna
1240095_5_a
Oh, hi Asuna...
Sinon
1240095_4_a
Huh?!
Sinon
1240095_3_a
Sinon
1240095_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Sinonon!
Asuna
1240095_1_a
I'll just say hello.
Asuna
1240093_25_a
No. I can't sit here and worry
about it.
Asuna
1240093_24_a
Maybe I shouldn't bring it up.
Asuna
1240093_23_a
So why would she start playing
OS without telling us?
Asuna
1240093_22_a
she said she was sticking to VR.
Asuna
1240093_21_a
When Liz and the others asked her
if she was going to try it out,
Asuna
1240093_20_b
Has she started playing OS too?
Asuna
1240093_19_a
Is that Sinonon?
What's she doing here?
Asuna
1240093_18_a
...
Sinon
1240093_17_a
Hm?
Asuna
1240093_16_a
Liz
1240093_15_a
Okay!
Asuna
1240093_14_a
Alright then, see you later in
ALO, Asuna!
Liz
1240093_13_a
Hehe, that's right. It'd be nice
to be able to balance both.
Asuna
1240093_12_a
It's not as though ALO is boring
now. Besides, I can only visit
Pina in ALO!
Silica
1240093_11_a
I know. I was just saying we have
to be careful.
Silica
1240093_10_a
Of course we have. It's a shiny
new game!
Liz
1240093_9_a
She's right. We've all been pretty
addicted to OS lately.
Silica
1240093_8_a
Yeah... And I feel like we'll end
up playing OS a lot more at this
rate.
Asuna
1240093_7_a
And we want to play ALO again,
don't we?
Liz
1240093_6_a
It's only been a few days since
we started OS. We've gotta keep an
eye on our play time!
Liz
1240093_5_a
Oh! Yeah, sure thing.
Liz
1240093_4_a
Silica
1240093_3_a
Liz
1240093_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Hey guys, do you mind if I log off
here?
Asuna
1240093_1_a
Yeah, got it...
Kirito
1240091_25_a
Let's respect her privacy.
Asuna
1240091_24_a
Hahaha! She's not going to tell
you EVERYTHING just because
we're friends, Kirito.
Asuna
1240091_23_a
Yeow!
Kirito
1240091_22_a
S-So what if I am! Don't go prying
into my business, okay?!
Sinon
1240091_21_a
Hm?
Kirito
1240091_20_a
I, uh...
Sinon
1240091_19_a
Er, okay, sorry to assume.
Are you saving up for something?
Kirito
1240091_18_a
Pfft, you say that as if I like
my job.
Sinon
1240091_17_a
You're really getting involved,
aren't you?
Kirito
1240091_16_a
Oh, okay.
Asuna
1240091_15_a
I'm scheduled to work tomorrow.
I don't think I'll get a chance
to log on.
Sinon
1240091_14_a
Actually, about that...
Sinon
1240091_13_a
Yeah, that works for me.
Kirito
1240091_12_a
This seems like a good stopping
point. Shall we log off and
continue this tomorrow?
Asuna
1240091_11_a
Oh, stop, we all made contributions
this time around.
Sinon
1240091_10_a
You definitely get the MVP award
for today's battle, Sinon.
Kirito
1240091_9_a
Not to mention the nasty combos
they unleashed as soon as we
got close...
Kirito
1240091_8_a
Yeah, our melee and magic attacks
wouldn't have dealt enough damage.
Kirito
1240091_7_a
Sure was. We couldn't have beat
them without your shooting!
Asuna
1240091_6_a
Whew. Those were some pretty
tough mobs!
Sinon
1240091_5_a
Right back at you, Asuna.
Kirito
1240091_4_a
Sinon
1240091_3_a
Kirito
1240091_2_a
bg_18_tower_road_sunset
Nice job, Kirito.
You too, Sinonon!
Asuna
1240091_1_a
ええ!
シノン
1240048_25_a
さあシノン
ここからはALOのクリスマスを
存分に楽しもうぜ!
キリト
1240048_24_a
シノン
1240048_23_a
おう、今行く!
キリト
1240048_22_a
キリトくーん!
シノのーん!
早く早くー!!
アスナ
1240048_21_a
シノン
1240048_20_a
ああ、そういうことだ
キリト
1240048_19_a
私の居場所はGGOと……
このALO……キリトやアスナ、
みんなのいるこの場所なのよね
シノン
1240048_18_a
私また誤解してたのかも
しれない
シノン
1240048_17_a
キリト……
ええ、そうね
シノン
1240048_16_a
それは杞憂なんだ
後ろめたくなんて思う必要も……
ないんだよ
キリト
1240048_15_a
だからお前がもし溶け込めてないって
感じたとしても、
キリト
1240048_14_a
みんなはシノンのことを
温かく出迎えてくれる
キリト
1240048_13_a
シノン……だから言ったとおりだろ?
キリト
1240048_12_a
………………
シノン
1240048_11_a
さあ、みんな勢ぞろいしてるよ
ほら、こっちこっち
アスナ
1240048_10_a
アスナ……
シノン
1240048_9_a
うん、それにシノのんは、GGOと
掛け持ちでプレイしてるんだから、
こういうことがあるのも仕方ないよ
アスナ
1240048_8_a
そうなのか?
キリト
1240048_7_a
なーんてね、冗談冗談
実はこっちもパーティの準備に
手間取っちゃってたんだ～
アスナ
1240048_6_a
アスナ……ごめんなさい
遅れて……
じ、実は私がワガママを……
シノン
1240048_5_a
ア、アスナ……すまん
キリト
1240048_4_a
シノン
1240048_3_a
キリト
1240048_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
シノのん!
キリトくん!
遅い!!
アスナ
1240048_1_a
キリト……ありがとう
シノン
1240047_30_a
遅刻するって連絡は
俺から入れておくよ
キリト
1240047_29_a
はは、大丈夫さ
みんな待っててくれる
キリト
1240047_28_a
いいの?
このままだとみんなとの待ち合わせに
遅れるわよ?
シノン
1240047_27_a
それでいいだろ?
キリト
1240047_26_a
お前が納得いくまで刃を研いでから、
ALOに戻ろう
キリト
1240047_25_a
おし、
じゃあ今日は俺もとことん付き合うぜ
キリト
1240047_24_a
キリト……
シノン
1240047_23_a
そうか
でもそれも悪くないよな
キリト
1240047_22_a
刃……か
的外れでもないわね、その表現
シノン
1240047_21_a
その……
自分の心の刃みたいなものを、
研ぎ澄まそうとしてるのか?
キリト
1240047_20_a
シノン……
お前はこのGGOに定期的に
戻ることで、
キリト
1240047_19_a
あの場所……あの空間は、
とても優しくて居心地がいいから……
シノン
1240047_18_a
みんなといるとね……その想いが……
少し揺らいでしまいそうになるの
シノン
1240047_17_a
過去の弱い自分と決別するため、
このGGOを選んだ……
シノン
1240047_16_a
でもね、
私が元々この仮想世界に来たのは、
自分自身を強くするため
シノン
1240047_15_a
えっ……?
キリト
1240047_14_a
もちろん楽しいし、
友達になってくれたアスナ達には
感謝しきれないくらいだわ……
シノン
1240047_13_a
別にね……
みんなと一緒にいるのが、
イヤってわけじゃないの
シノン
1240047_12_a
シノン……
キリト
1240047_11_a
………………
シノン
1240047_10_a
なんでだよ?
みんなきっと俺たちが戻ってくるのを
待ちわびてるぞ
キリト
1240047_9_a
私は今日はGGOで過ごすわ
シノン
1240047_8_a
えっ……?
キリト
1240047_7_a
戻るならキリト一人で戻りなさい
シノン
1240047_6_a
じゃあそろそろALOに……
キリト
1240047_5_a
確かに……マージン分は
だいぶ稼いだし、これで
ランキングには食い込めるはず……
シノン
1240047_4_a
おい、シノン
これだけ討伐すればもう十分
なんじゃないか
キリト
1240047_3_a
キリト
1240047_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
ふぅ……
シノン
1240047_1_a
シノン……?
キリト
1240045_33_a
そうね……
シノン
1240045_32_a
………………
シノン
1240045_31_a
んで、ALOに戻って
みんなとクリスマスパーティでもして
盛り上がるのもいいんじゃないか?
キリト
1240045_30_a
この調子でバンバン鳥を倒して、
さっさとクエストクリアしようぜ
キリト
1240045_29_a
そうね……
シノン
1240045_28_a
ってことは後発でも
上位に食い込むのは、
それほど大変じゃなさそうだな
キリト
1240045_27_a
さすがのゲームホリックたちも、
この時期ばかりは現実に戻る
みたいだわ
シノン
1240045_26_a
アメリカ人の文化ではクリスマスは
新年よりも重要な行事だしね
シノン
1240045_25_a
アメリカ……ああ、なるほど
クリスマス時期だとさすがに、
現実世界を重要視するわけか
キリト
1240045_24_a
GGOは海外サーバーもあるでしょ
メインのプレイヤーは
FPS好きのアメリカ人よ
シノン
1240045_23_a
ん、どういう意味だ?
キリト
1240045_22_a
そうね……
まあ、この時期はそうなるのか……
シノン
1240045_21_a
あ、ああ
ここってかなり有名な狩猟ポイント
なのに、プレイヤーも少ないもんな
キリト
1240045_20_a
……にしても、このクエスト、
想像してたよりもスムーズね
ちょっと肩透かしかも……
シノン
1240045_19_a
は、はい……
キリト
1240045_18_a
私が仕留めそこなって
地上に落ちてきた奴がいたら、
トドメを刺す役を頼むわ
シノン
1240045_17_a
キリトの光剣と拳銃じゃ
とても空飛ぶMobには
届かないでしょ
シノン
1240045_16_a
ええと……俺はなにをすれば……
キリト
1240045_15_a
ちょっと待って
今いいところだから
シノン
1240045_14_a
あの……シノンさん
キリト
1240045_13_a
………………
シノン
1240045_12_a
………………
キリト
1240045_11_a
ギャッ!
グギャッ!
モンスター
1240045_10_a
………………
シノン
1240045_9_a
おっ、次も命中だな!
キリト
1240045_8_a
ギャオッ!
モンスター
1240045_7_a
………………
シノン
1240045_6_a
こんなの当たり前よ
ん……あの廃墟の上にも
群れがたむろしてるわね……
シノン
1240045_5_a
おおっ、さすがシノン
一発で仕留めたな!
キリト
1240045_4_a
グギャアッ!
モンスター
1240045_3_a
キリト
1240045_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
………………
シノン
1240045_1_a
お、おう
そうだな……
キリト
1240043_19_a
既に開催されて数日経過してるから、
ここから上位に追いつくには
気合い入れてやらないとね
シノン
1240043_18_a
さあ行くわよ
シノン
1240043_17_a
ううむ……それもそうか
キリト
1240043_16_a
ないわよ
というかGGOでそんなイベントは
滅多にないでしょ
シノン
1240043_15_a
クリスマスイベントと言うからには、
なんか困ってるNPCを助けるとか、
微笑ましいエピソードはないのか?
キリト
1240043_14_a
そうみたいね
シノン
1240043_13_a
つまりスローター系!?
キリト
1240043_12_a
《バンデット・ナイトジャー》を
狩猟せよ……
キリト
1240043_11_a
なになに
パーティに出す大量のチキンを
用意するため、
キリト
1240043_10_a
そのクリスマス限定のクエストと
やらは、一体どんな内容なんだ……
キリト
1240043_9_a
………………
シノン
1240043_8_a
ALOに戻るのはその後でいいだろ?
キリト
1240043_7_a
い、いやいいって
それよりもさっさと
こっちのクエストやっちゃおうぜ
キリト
1240043_6_a
やっぱりALOに戻った方が……
シノン
1240043_5_a
キリトがさっき言ってたけど、
賑やかなクリスマスの雰囲気を
楽しみたいなら、
シノン
1240043_4_a
若干の装飾はされてるけど、
ALOほど大がかりなお祭りムード
にはなってないわね
シノン
1240043_3_a
シノン
1240043_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
なんか……
クリスマスと言っても
特になにも変わらないな……
キリト
1240043_1_a
キリト
1240041_18_a
そう……
好きにしなさい
シノン
1240041_17_a
俺もそのクエストは付き合うよ
キリト
1240041_16_a
そうか……
シノンのGGOにかける想いは
わかったよ
キリト
1240041_15_a
なにかアップデートがあったときは
ちゃんと戻ってプレイして
おきたいのよ
シノン
1240041_14_a
別にそういう意味じゃないわ
ただ私は元々GGOプレイヤー
シノン
1240041_13_a
ああ、機嫌損ねるなよ
キリト
1240041_12_a
嫌なら別に付き合う必要はないわ
私一人でも行くから、
キリトはALOに戻りなさい
シノン
1240041_11_a
そこでクリスマスと言われましても、
どうにも想像つかなくて……
キリト
1240041_10_a
GGOは退廃した近未来世界だろ?
キリト
1240041_9_a
いやまあ
ALOみたいなファンタジー世界の
クリスマスなら想像しやすいけど、
キリト
1240041_8_a
なによ
シノン
1240041_7_a
GGOでクリスマス……
うーん……
キリト
1240041_6_a
ええ、今クリスマス時期の
イベントクエストが開催されてるのよ
シノン
1240041_5_a
ホントにGGOに行くのか?
キリト
1240041_4_a
なに、キリト?
シノン
1240041_3_a
シノン
1240041_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
なあ、シノン
キリト
1240041_1_a
はぁ……わかったよ
どこまでも付き合うぜ、シノン
キリト
1240028_34_a
はは……
こっからはキリトに任せるぜ
エギル
1240028_33_a
当然よ!
シノン
1240028_32_a
ええっ!?
今からですか!?
キリト
1240028_31_a
GGOにダイブするから
付き合いなさい!
シノン
1240028_30_a
は、はい!?
キリト
1240028_29_a
キリト!
シノン
1240028_28_a
今なんか無性に
銃を撃ちたくなってきたわ……!
シノン
1240028_27_a
ああ～っ、もうなんか
ムシャクシャしてきたわ!
シノン
1240028_26_a
そうなんだけど……
シノン
1240028_25_a
お互いの特徴を食い合っても
仕方ないだろ……?
キリト
1240028_24_a
ま、まあALOとGGOは
魔法と銃って要素で
一応すみ分けしてるわけだし……
キリト
1240028_23_a
それはそうだけど……
やっぱりALOの世界に銃なんて
存在しなかったのね……
シノン
1240028_22_a
役に立つ武器なのはわかったし、
今後も十分活用していけるだろ?
エギル
1240028_21_a
でもまあこいつのおかげで
あのサラマンダー達をぶっ飛ばせた
わけだろ?
エギル
1240028_20_a
そういうことになるわね……
シノン
1240028_19_a
シノンがさっき使ってた
爆発属性のスキルに近い技を出せる
武器ってことか
キリト
1240028_18_a
GGOのへカート
似ても似つかない代物だわ……
シノン
1240028_17_a
ええ、これは魔法を込めた弾を放つ
サラマンダーの魔法具よ
シノン
1240028_16_a
はは、確かに銃弾を放ってはいるが、
派手に爆発してたもんな
キリト
1240028_15_a
それはそうよ……
だってこれ……
全然銃じゃないんだもの……
シノン
1240028_14_a
ん、あからさまに
テンション落ちてるな……?
エギル
1240028_13_a
ええ……そうね……
シノン
1240028_12_a
ふぅ……
あいつらみんな退散したみたいだな
キリト
1240028_11_a
残念だけど……
扱いに慣れるには……
しばらく時間がかかりそうよ……
シノン
1240028_9_a
お、おれらが悪かった!
か、か、勘弁してくれ～～!!
サラマンダー
1240028_8_a
キリト、巻き添え食うなよ!
エギル
1240028_7_a
うおっ……すごい爆発!
キリト
1240028_6_a
た、た、助けてくれぇぇ!!
サラマンダー
1240028_5_a
……!
シノン
1240028_4_a
キリト
1240028_3_a
シノン
1240028_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave_boss
ぐぎゃああっ!!
サラマンダー
1240028_1_a
へへっ、そう来ると思ったぜ!
よし、やってやろう!
キリト
1240027_27_a
鉄の世界で、冷徹な狙撃手と
恐れられた私の実力……
見せてあげる!
シノン
1240027_26_a
こんな下衆な奴ら……
倒すことになんの躊躇も要らない!
シノン
1240027_25_a
ふふっ……いいわね
文字通り試し撃ちする相手としては
この上ないメンツだわ
シノン
1240027_24_a
シノン……どうする?
キリト
1240027_23_a
攻略しても先着順だからな
無駄な努力になっちまうのは
避けたいってことよ!
サラマンダー
1240027_22_a
そんな面倒なこと
わざわざしてられるかよ?
サラマンダー
1240027_21_a
なにを言ってるんだ?
お前達もサラマンダーなら、
自分でクエストやればいいだろ?
エギル
1240027_20_a
お前ら……!
キリト
1240027_19_a
そんなことはいいから、
そいつをおれたちにくれないか?
サラマンダー
1240027_18_a
なんだ、お前たちは……
エギル
1240027_17_a
サラマンダーのプレイヤー……?
10人以上いるな……
囲まれてる……!?
キリト
1240027_16_a
へへっ、クエスト攻略ご苦労さん……
サラマンダー
1240027_15_a
ん……?
キリト
1240027_14_a
おし、じゃあ早速
武器の性能を試してみようぜ……
キリト
1240027_13_a
二人のおかげで
これを手に入れられたのは
間違いないからね
シノン
1240027_12_a
ふふっ……でもまあ
今日は悪態つくのも許してあげる
シノン
1240027_11_a
キリト～!
シノン
1240027_10_a
一番乗りってことか
まあシノンさんに尻叩かれながら、
急ぎ足でここまで来たからな～
キリト
1240027_9_a
おっ……結局なんだかんだで、
この報酬を最初に手に入れたのも
俺たちみたいだぜ
エギル
1240027_8_a
期待が高まるわ……
シノン
1240027_7_a
ええ……使ってみないと
操作感はわからないけど……
見た目は完全に狙撃銃よね……
シノン
1240027_6_a
やったな、シノン!
キリト
1240027_5_a
火器……
《へカート・エクリクシス》
シノン
1240027_4_a
エギル
1240027_3_a
キリト
1240027_2_a
item_event_124002_gun
bg_event_fire_cave_boss
やった……
ついに手に入れたわ……
今回の報酬……
シノン
1240027_1_a
おう!
キリト
1240025_40_a
も、もう、うるさいわよ!
さっさと先に行きましょう!
シノン
1240025_39_a
今日は本当に前向きで
まさに闘志をメラメラさせてるって
感じだな!
キリト
1240025_38_a
はは、いつものシノンだと
「べ、別に大したことじゃないわよ」
とか言ってツンケンするのに、
キリト
1240025_37_a
ええ……
火器をなんとしてでも
手に入れたいからね
シノン
1240025_36_a
シノンがどれだけこのクエに
真剣になってたのかよくわかるぜ
キリト
1240025_35_a
サラマンダーになって
まだ日も浅いのに
もう習得してるなんて、
キリト
1240025_34_a
ええ、このダンジョンにこういう
タイプのモンスターが出るって
知ってから、すぐ練習したのよ
シノン
1240025_33_a
爆発属性ってとこか……
表面の硬い敵を内部から
破壊したんだな……
キリト
1240025_32_a
今のスキルに限定して
火属性が爆発を引き起こすのよ
シノン
1240025_31_a
サラマンダーの火属性魔法付加の
攻撃スキルにアレンジを加えたものよ
シノン
1240025_30_a
今のスキルは?
エギル
1240025_29_a
ふぅ……
シノン
1240025_28_a
た、倒した……
キリト
1240025_27_a
ググャアアアッーーーッ!!
モンスター
1240025_26_a
エギル
1240025_25_a
シノンの連射した弓が
モンスターの各部位に当たって……
爆発した!?
キリト
1240025_24_a
シノン
1240025_23_a
グゴッ!?
グゴガガガガッ!!
モンスター
1240025_22_a
ハッ!!
シノン
1240025_21_a
ええ、任せて……
よく狙って……
シノン
1240025_20_a
エギル
1240025_19_a
あ……ああ!
キリト
1240025_18_a
キリト、ここはサラマンダー専用の
ダンジョンだろ!?
一旦シノンに任せてみようぜ!
エギル
1240025_17_a
エギル
1240025_16_a
なに!?
キリト
1240025_15_a
大丈夫……
こんな敵が出たときのために、
覚えておいたスキルがあるの……
シノン
1240025_14_a
エギル
1240025_13_a
シノン!?
お前が前に出るのは危険だ!
キリト
1240025_12_a
二人とも、どいてて
シノン
1240025_11_a
効いてはいる……
だが……致命傷には程遠い……!?
キリト
1240025_10_a
なっ!?
エギル
1240025_9_a
グゴッ!?
モンスター
1240025_8_a
ぞりゃああっ!!
エギル
1240025_7_a
もっと他の言い方ねーのかよ!
エギル
1240025_6_a
りょ、了解だ、スイッチ!
エギル、その馬鹿力で
ぶっ飛ばしてくれ!
キリト
1240025_5_a
キリト!
前衛交代だ!
エギル
1240025_4_a
くっ……!
こいつ思ったよりも頑丈だな……!
キリト
1240025_3_a
キリト
1240025_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave_boss
グゴアアアッ!
モンスター
1240025_1_a
おおっ……やっぱり今日の
シノンはなんか燃えてるな!
キリト
1240023_38_a
ふっ……やれるものなら
やってみなさい……
絶対に報酬は渡さないわ……!
シノン
1240023_37_a
なるほどな……
キリト
1240023_36_a
道中好戦的なサラマンダー連中と
PvPやることにもなるかも
しれないぜ
エギル
1240023_35_a
かなりハードな競争になることは
間違いないだろう……
エギル
1240023_34_a
クリアの上位数名しか
手に入らない……
エギル
1240023_33_a
しかも報酬が未知の武器ってことで
話題になってるし、
エギル
1240023_32_a
確かに、アスナもリズとシリカに
協力してもらって、クエスト
請けたって言ってたな……
キリト
1240023_31_a
元々サラマンダーだった者たちや
該当者のいるパーティ全体が
参加できる仕様って話だ
エギル
1240023_30_a
このクエはキャンペーンに受かった
プレイヤーだけじゃなく、
エギル
1240023_29_a
ここに来る直前に得た情報だから
確かだと思う
エギル
1240023_28_a
えっ?
シノン
1240023_27_a
待ってくれ
一応伝えておくが、このクエスト……
結構参加者が多いらしい
エギル
1240023_26_a
はは、すまんすまん
それじゃあ早速行こうぜ
キリト
1240023_25_a
キリト……
それって上手いこと言ったつもり?
シノン
1240023_24_a
熱血なサラマンダーだけに……
キリト
1240023_23_a
おおっ……シノンさん、
心なしかいつもよりも
やる気に満ちてる気がするぞ
キリト
1240023_22_a
そうね、ぬか喜びするのは
良くないかもしれないけど……
やるからには本気で行くわよ!
シノン
1240023_21_a
そうだな、だから火器っていうのも
単純にサラマンダーの武器って
意味かもしれない
キリト
1240023_20_a
正直神々の世界で銃ってのは、
合ってないんじゃないのか?
エギル
1240023_19_a
だが世界観的にはどうなんだ?
ALOはSAO以上の
ファンタジー世界だろ?
エギル
1240023_18_a
ALOで銃が使えるなんて、
思ってもみなかったから……
シノン
1240023_17_a
まあでもこの格好だと
更にやる気が出てくるのは確かよ……
シノン
1240023_16_a
み、見てません見てません!
キリト
1240023_15_a
あ、あんたどこ見てんのよ!
シノン
1240023_14_a
おへそが見えてるとこも……
キリト
1240023_13_a
この髪型とかもGGOの私の
アバター風にアレンジしてみたの
シノン
1240023_12_a
そ、そうよ
パンツルックにマフラーなんかも、
近い感じがしたから
シノン
1240023_11_a
というかアバターが
GGOのやつっぽくないか？
キリト
1240023_10_a
ん……あれ？
その衣装ってGGOのシノンが
着てるのとよく似てる……？
キリト
1240023_9_a
ふ、ふん……
シノン
1240023_8_a
ああ、似合ってる
キリト
1240023_7_a
はは、いいじゃないか
エギル
1240023_6_a
ちょ、ちょっとジロジロ見ないで!
シノン
1240023_5_a
お、おおう……
キリト
1240023_4_a
エギル
1240023_3_a
キリト
1240023_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
………………
シノン
1240023_1_a
ああ、もちろんだ
キリト
1240021_27_a
ということで二人とも、
協力してくれる?
シノン
1240021_26_a
なるほどな……
そりゃあシノンもやる気になるわけだ
キリト
1240021_25_a
ふふっ、そういうこと
シノン
1240021_24_a
このALOにも
ついに銃が実装されたって
ことなのか?
エギル
1240021_23_a
なるほど……
エギル
1240021_22_a
普通はそう連想しちゃうわよね
シノン
1240021_21_a
火器って……銃火器?
キリト
1240021_20_a
ええ、報酬が《火器》らしいの
シノン
1240021_19_a
噂……?
エギル
1240021_18_a
でもね
このクエスト報酬に関して、
ある噂が流れてるのよ……
シノン
1240021_17_a
ケットシーで満足してるし……
シノン
1240021_16_a
ああ、それね……
単刀直入に言って興味はないわ
種族にはね
シノン
1240021_15_a
ああ、シノンってサラマンダーとか
特に興味ないような気がしてたから
キリト
1240021_14_a
意外?
シノン
1240021_13_a
もちろんいいけど……
ちょっと意外だな
キリト
1240021_12_a
受かった人たちだけが請けられる
限定クエもいくつか実装されてるの
その一つの攻略に協力してほしいのよ
シノン
1240021_11_a
そんなのがあるんだな……
エギル
1240021_10_a
この前アスナも受かったって
言ってたよな
キリト
1240021_9_a
ああ、一時的にサラマンダーの
装備を着られるってやつだろ?
キリト
1240021_8_a
サラマンダー・キャンペーン?
エギル
1240021_7_a
今回……実は私、
サラマンダー・キャンペーンの
応募に当選したの
シノン
1240021_6_a
エギル
1240021_5_a
キリト
1240021_4_a
エギル
1240021_3_a
キリト
1240021_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
じゃあ二人とも
話を聞いてくれる?
シノン
1240021_1_a
R-Right. Sure.
Kirito
1240018_23_a
I'm still not comfortable with my
mobile sniping abilities.
Sinon
1240018_22_a
Besides, we've wasted enough time!
Let's get back to practicing!
Sinon
1240018_21_a
Like what?
I wasn't looking at anything!
Sinon
1240018_20_a
What're you looking at me like
that for, Sinon?
Kirito
1240018_19_a
Kirito...
Sinon
1240018_18_a
It definitely hurt, but I was focused 
so I guess I didn't think about it.
Kirito
1240018_17_a
Pretty much.
My determination won out.
Kirito
1240018_16_a
So you're saying you just fought
through it?
Sinon
1240018_15_a
It actually hurts a ton.
GGO's Pain Absorber is
set pretty low.
Kirito
1240018_14_a
I started to wonder if you
had any sense of pain at all.
Sinon
1240018_13_a
It sure didn't look like it
from what I saw.
Sinon
1240018_12_a
I told you it hurt, didn't I?
Kirito
1240018_11_a
I don't know how you managed to
keep fighting against Death Gun.
You should've been dead.
Sinon
1240018_10_a
You know, I was just thinking...
Sinon
1240018_9_a
Yeah... That really hurt...
Kirito
1240018_8_a
You might as well have been
playing ALO, the way you flew out
of the driver's seat!
Sinon
1240018_7_a
What about you, Kirito?
Are YOU okay?
Sinon
1240018_6_a
It's fine. The buggy wasn't
damaged, and neither was I.
Sinon
1240018_5_a
Sinon, I'm so sorry!
Kirito
1240018_4_a
I can't believe you...
Sinon
1240018_3_a
Sinon
1240018_2_a
bg_s2_06_highway
Phew...
Kirito
1240018_1_a
Sinon
1240017_23_a
Ahhhhhhh!
Kirito
1240017_22_a
There's rubble all over the road!
Sinon
1240017_21_a
Say what?!
Kirito
1240017_20_a
Kirito, look out!
Sinon
1240017_19_a
C'mon, it's fine!
Kirito
1240017_18_a
No way! No distracted
driving on my watch!
Sinon
1240017_17_a
Heh, I can take a little peek.
Kirito
1240017_16_a
It's a shame you can't get a good
look at them while you're driving.
Sinon
1240017_15_a
They're filled with gasoline.
The effects are pretty over
the top.
Sinon
1240017_14_a
Whoa! I can feel the
shockwaves from here!
Kirito
1240017_13_a
Here goes.
Sinon
1240017_12_a
Yeah, this'll work.
Sinon
1240017_11_a
Want me to maintain this distance?
Kirito
1240017_10_a
...
Sinon
1240017_9_a
Roger that!
Kirito
1240017_8_a
I've got no business using a bow
in ALO!
Sinon
1240017_7_a
No, it's perfect! If I can't hit
one from this far out,
Sinon
1240017_6_a
I-Is this too far away?
Kirito
1240017_5_a
No, just circle around them so I
can eyeball how far away they are!
Sinon
1240017_4_a
Want me to get closer?
Kirito
1240017_3_a
Kirito
1240017_2_a
bg_s2_06_highway
There are some decommissioned
vehicles off to the right here.
They're my next target!
Sinon
1240017_1_a
Huh?
Kirito
1240015_21_a
Forget it.
Just drive.
Sinon
1240015_20_a
Just what?
Kirito
1240015_19_a
You are just...
Sinon
1240015_18_a
Tough enough?!
That really hurt, y'know!
Kirito
1240015_17_a
so I figured you
were tough enough.
Sinon
1240015_16_a
Well, you got wounded pretty
badly in the fight against Death
Gun and didn't whine at all,
Sinon
1240015_15_a
Besides, hits in GGO hurt worse
than in ALO!
Kirito
1240015_14_a
Hey, how am I supposed to
watch myself?! I've got to keep my
eyes on the road!
Kirito
1240015_13_a
but the explosions might kick
some sparks and ash our way,
so watch yourself.
Sinon
1240015_12_a
I'll be aiming at distant targets,
Sinon
1240015_11_a
Whoa.
Sounds like this could turn into
an action movie!
Kirito
1240015_10_a
A lot of the objects in GGO
explode, so I'll know when I've
hit my target.
Sinon
1240015_9_a
Yup.
Sinon
1240015_8_a
So, like, barrels and scrap metal?
Kirito
1240015_7_a
Don't worry about it. Just drive
over easy terrain, and I'll shoot
at whatever's around.
Sinon
1240015_6_a
But at that point we're pretty
much off-roading. That'll make
driving tricky...
Kirito
1240015_5_a
But what will you use for targets?
Do you want to head out of
town and find some mobs?
Kirito
1240015_4_a
That's the plan.
Sinon
1240015_3_a
Sinon
1240015_2_a
bg_s2_06_highway
Well then, we'd better
find a rental shop.
Kirito
1240015_1_a
Exactly.
Sinon
1240013_29_a
You brought me here to drive you
around in this buggy for high-
speed target practice?
Kirito
1240013_28_a
So let me guess...
Kirito
1240013_27_a
Yeah, so buckle up.
I need you to drive again.
Sinon
1240013_26_a
Yeah...
When Death Gun was chasing us...
Kirito
1240013_25_a
Which is why we're going to use
a buggy. You've driven one
of these before, haven't you?
Sinon
1240013_24_a
But GGO avatars move at superhuman
speeds! You'll never adapt!
Kirito
1240013_23_a
Bingo.
Sinon
1240013_22_a
Hit distant targets while moving
at high speed?
Kirito
1240013_21_a
Do what?
Kirito
1240013_20_a
So I figured I'd come back to the
game I know and practice until I
can do it.
Sinon
1240013_19_a
Oh...
Kirito
1240013_18_a
Within a certain range, yeah, but
it doesn't do anything to help
you hit distant targets.
Sinon
1240013_17_a
Didn't ALO have a little
bit of aim assist?
Kirito
1240013_16_a
while flying through the air,
myself, I feel like I'm performing
some sort of acrobatic show.
Sinon
1240013_15_a
But when I'm trying to
hit a moving target
Sinon
1240013_14_a
I can drop a target from two
kilometers out before they even
know what hit them.
Sinon
1240013_13_a
Snipers like me are used
to lying in wait.
Sinon
1240013_12_a
Uh, yeah, I guess that would be
pretty tough for an archer.
Kirito
1240013_11_a
Trying to shoot arrows while I
was moving that fast was next
to impossible.
Sinon
1240013_10_a
Didn't you ever find the flying
to be way too fast?
Sinon
1240013_9_a
Erm, yeah. Yeah, it is.
Kirito
1240013_8_a
ALO's the one where we
can fly, right?
Sinon
1240013_7_a
...
Sinon
1240013_6_a
So how about you tell me why you
brought me to GGO?
Kirito
1240013_5_a
Yeah, okay, got it.
Kirito
1240013_4_a
Yeah. And don't talk to me like
I'm some sort of robot.
You sound weird.
Sinon
1240013_3_a
Sinon
1240013_2_a
bg_s2_06_highway
Have you had enough time to
reflect, Sinon?
Kirito
1240013_1_a
Knock yourself out.
Sinon
1240011_15_a
Gotcha.
Will you wait here while I go
check out the shop?

But these are my old stomping
grounds. Lots of memories here.
Good and bad. So give me a sec.
Sinon
1240011_13_a
ever since I got to know
you and Asuna...
Sinon
1240011_12_a
True, I've been playing
a lot more ALO
Sinon
1240011_11_a
O-Okay!
Kirito
1240011_10_a
I'm fine! Let me be!
Sinon
1240011_9_a
Really? I guess you've been
logging into ALO more often
these days.
Kirito
1240011_8_a
No. I'm just taking it all in.
It's been a while since my last
dive. It feels pretty good.
Sinon
1240011_7_a
Are you upset?
Kirito
1240011_6_a
What.
Sinon
1240011_5_a
Hm?
Uh, Sinon?
Kirito
1240011_4_a
...
Sinon
1240011_3_a
Sinon
1240011_2_a
bg_s2_06_highway
Hey, Sinon.
Kirito
1240011_1_a
And I'm always happy to see more
people get interested in VR!
Liz
1050078_20_a
Seems that way! It's these sorts
of little, practical applications
that'll help make VR mainstream.
Liz
1050078_19_a
Hehe, I guess we found a
surprising new use for VR
today, huh?
Silica
1050078_18_a
I bet so too. There are tons of
kids who pester their parents
to give them snacks.
Liz
1050078_17_a
I'm sure their parents will be
very pleased to learn that little
tidbit of information.
Adult
1050078_16_a
Right! Also, I learned that if
kids eat lots of sweets in VR,
they won't want them in real life.
Adult
1050078_15_a
Eating too much candy isn't good
for you?
Liz
1050078_14_a
Thank you very much, girls.
I think the children learned
something today.
Adult
1050078_13_a
Ahaha, we weren't competing or
anything here, Silica.
Liz
1050078_12_a
Hehe. Then this battle is our
victory! Yay!
Silica
1050078_11_a
We tried to keep up with you,
but you built them faster than
we could eat them...
Child A
1050078_10_a
Hey, you're the candy house fixer
lady, right? You work real fast!
Child A
1050078_9_a
Silica
1050078_8_a
Hah! What happened to your fire,
kiddos?! I thought you could eat
candy till you dropped.
Liz
1050078_7_a
Me too... I don't even wanna eat
any when we get back to the real
world...
Child B
1050078_6_a
Whoa, that's great!
But I think I'm sick of
candy for now...
Child A
1050078_5_a
Hey, look! The candy houses are
all coming back again!
Child B
1050078_4_a
Silica
1050078_3_a
Liz
1050078_2_a
bg_event_valentine_town
Ungh... So...full...
Child A
1050078_1_a
Hmm. Yeah, sure! I'm not doing
anything else today. Why not.
Liz
1050077_21_a
Should we do it?
Silica
1050077_20_a
I bet they'd like that! I can
ask Asuna and the others if
they want to help.
Silica
1050077_19_a
That way, we can just let them
have the run of the town and
eat to their heart's content.
Liz
1050077_18_a
Maybe we should get a bunch of
people on permanent rebuilding
duty and let the kids go wild.
Liz
1050077_17_a
Hehe, ah well. They're kids, and
this is a town made of chocolate.
This was bound to happen.
Liz
1050077_16_a
S-Sorry... I've scolded them a
dozen times now, but they just
don't listen...
Adult
1050077_15_a
Nooo! All our hard work, gone in
the blink of an eye...
Silica
1050077_14_a
Candy!! Woohoo!!!
Children
1050077_13_a
And no matter how much we eat,
we don't get full! So candy!
Candy candy candy!!
Child B
1050077_12_a
Cause we can eat all the candy
we want here and we won't get
cavities! Wooo!
Child A
1050077_11_a
CHILDREN! Control yourselves!!
How are you still hungry, anyway?!
Adult
1050077_10_a
H-Hey, hold it right there,
kiddos! Paws off the chocolate!
We just fixed those!
Liz
1050077_9_a
Yaaay! Eat 'em! Eat 'em all!
Child B
1050077_8_a
Hey, everyone! The candy houses
are all fixed! Let's eat 'em!
Child A
1050077_7_a
Uh oh. I don't like this.
Liz
1050077_6_a
Wow! Look, all the candy houses
are back!
???
1050077_5_a
Heh, it was relatively easy, but
only because we're so amazing.
Liz
1050077_4_a
Yup! We already did this once
before, so we pretty much had
everything down pat.
Silica
1050077_3_a
Silica
1050077_2_a
bg_event_valentine_town
And that's a wrap!
Town's fixed!
Liz
1050077_1_a
The NPCs will do most of the work,
so with a bit of help from us, it
should be fine in no time.
Silica
1050075_27_a
Then it'll be easier to fix than
last time. Those dragons leveled
most of the place.
Silica
1050075_26_a
Yup!
Asuna
1050075_25_a
Fine, sure. I mean, they only ate
this section of town, right?
Liz
1050075_24_a
Silica
1050075_23_a
Liz
1050075_22_a
So Silica, Liz... Please please
please help me rebuild town
again?
Asuna
1050075_21_a
Hehehe... Chocolate is tasty...
Sphica
1050075_20_a
You're one to talk, Sphica. You
were running around like a feral
child just a few minutes ago.
Feliz
1050075_19_a
Feliz
1050075_18_a
Yui
1050075_17_a
These kids are more destructive
than a whole swarm of
fire-breathing dragons!
Sphica
1050075_16_a
And no matter how much candy
you eat in VR, you won't get a
cavity...
Silica
1050075_15_a
I can't say I'm surprised. What
kid wouldn't flip their lid if
they saw all this chocolate?
Liz
1050075_14_a
They just started running around,
shouting and gobbling up
everything in sight.
Asuna
1050075_13_a
The second they saw a whole town
made of chocolate, they went on a
rampage. No one can stop them.
Asuna
1050075_12_a
No way?! This is all the work
of those kids here for that
educational whatever it was?!
Liz
1050075_9_a
Asuna
1050075_11_a
Silica
1050075_10_a
Feliz
1050075_8_a
Sphica
1050075_7_a
This is the aftermath of a
swarm of hungry children.
Yui
1050075_6_a
Er, no. This wasn't the dragons,
Silica.
Asuna
1050075_5_a
Oh no! Don't tell me the dragons
attacked town again?
Silica
1050075_4_a
Asuna
1050075_3_a
Silica
1050075_2_a
bg_event_broken_valentine_town
Wow...
Liz
1050075_1_a
Okay, chill. They're just kids,
right? How bad can it be?
Liz
1050073_21_a
The second they saw all the
chocolate, they lost control!
It's madness out there, madness!
Asuna
1050073_20_a
Yes! The first group's already
here, and it's terrible!
Asuna
1050073_19_a
Okay, I get the picture. So, does
this have something to do with why
you look so stressed right now?
Liz
1050073_18_a
Liz
1050073_17_a
Silica
1050073_16_a
Hehe, they better appreciate all
the effort we put in for them!
Asuna
1050073_15_a
But I was here first, so I get to
show those kids the ropes!
Sphica
1050073_14_a
Feliz
1050073_13_a
Sphica
1050073_12_a
Correct. However, the idea is to
acclimate them to VR little-by-
little. With safeguards in place.
Yui
1050073_11_a
But aren't little kids not allowed
to dive into VR?
Silica
1050073_10_a
Apparently, some people on the
board of education came up with
the idea.
Asuna
1050073_9_a
But anyway, they brought a few
of those kids here to play.
Asuna
1050073_8_a
Yeah. Of course, they've all got
parents and engineers keeping
an eye on them. It's a trial.
Asuna
1050073_7_a
A VR educational program?
They're letting kids put on
AmuSpheres?
Liz
1050073_6_a
So, there's this program going on
now to bring children into VR and
teach them stuff.
Asuna
1050073_5_a
Well, it's basically every little
kids' dream come true.
Asuna
1050073_4_a
Silica
1050073_3_a
Liz
1050073_2_a
bg_event_valentine_town
This may sound totally obvious,
but this town's made of candy
and chocolate, right?
Asuna
1050073_1_a
Silica
1050071_23_a
Sure. What's up?
Liz
1050071_22_a
Yui
1050071_21_a
Kinda. There's something I wanted
to ask you two. Do you have a
minute?
Asuna
1050071_20_a
Liz
1050071_19_a
Hi everyone! Are you guys here
to sightsee?
Silica
1050071_18_a
H-Hello...
Feliz
1050071_17_a
Feliz
1050071_16_a
Hi there!
Sphica
1050071_15_a
Asuna
1050071_14_a
Good afternoon!
Yui
1050071_13_a
Silica
1050071_12_a
Well, if it isn't Asuna.
How's it going?
Liz
1050071_11_a
Oh! Hey girls! What's up?
???
1050071_10_a
Let's see... We beat up dragons,
rebuilt town, and made chocolate.
There's nothing left to do!
Silica
1050071_9_a
Hmm... We finished this
event's main quest, so...
Huh. I'm at a loss.
Liz
1050071_8_a
Well, now that the chocolate's
done, what do you want to do?
Silica
1050071_7_a
Hehe, they better appreciate all
the effort we put in for them!
Liz
1050071_6_a
That's for sure! But we managed
to make enough tasty chocolate
for everyone!
Silica
1050071_5_a
So did you. Making Fire Chocolate
was no walk in the park.
Liz
1050071_4_a
Liz
1050071_3_a
You really worked hard, Liz!
Silica
1050071_2_a
bg_event_valentine_town
Phew... We're finally finished...
Liz
1050071_1_a
...Thanks, Sinon. I think I've got
a bit of my confidence back!
Liz
1050058_25_a
Heh, looks like all your years of
hard crafting work weren't a waste
after all, huh?
Sinon
1050058_24_a
Th-Thank you very much!
Liz
1050058_23_a
You've got the skills and the
talent to be one of the best!
Master Bladesmith
1050058_22_a
You looked down just now, but I
wouldn't feel bad if I were you.
Master Bladesmith
1050058_21_a
I... Th-That's... Er...
Liz
1050058_20_a
You've got the heart of a master
smith in you. I'm sure the game
gave you some sort of hidden buff.
Master Bladesmith
1050058_19_a
You spent a long, long time as a
smith in other VRMMOs, right?
Master Bladesmith
1050058_18_a
It's not all skill points. I could
tell by the look in your eye when
you held that hammer...
Master Bladesmith
1050058_17_a
But I just made this character...
My skill levels are still really
low...
Liz
1050058_16_a
My guess is that we hit the
lottery, and your smithing skill
massively buffed mine somehow.
Master Bladesmith
1050058_15_a
I'm positive. I could never have
made it by myself.
Master Bladesmith
1050058_14_a
Are...you sure? I just helped you
out a bit
I don't think I deserve
it...
Liz
1050058_13_a
Hey Lisbeth. I'm giving this
blade to you.
Master Bladesmith
1050058_12_a
For sure. Still, I've worked here
for a long time, and I've never
seen a rare blade of this quality.
Master Bladesmith
1050058_11_a
Interesting. I guess game systems
like this need a worthwhile
reward to justify all the labor.
Sinon
1050058_10_a
Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth
all the extra work and effort we
put into making swords this way.
Master Bladesmith
1050058_9_a
Thing is, occasionally we produce
an extra-rare, unique blade here.
Master Bladesmith
1050058_8_a
You do?
Liz
1050058_7_a
It's truly an original masterwork!
Master Bladesmith
1050058_6_a
This blade came out incredibly
well. It doesn't even have a name
yet.
Master Bladesmith
1050058_5_a
What is it?
Liz
1050058_4_a
Sinon
1050058_3_a
Liz
1050058_2_a
bg_07_lisbeth_smith_work
Whoa!
This is a surprise!
Master Bladesmith
1050058_1_a
Yeah, I guess...
Liz
1050057_23_a
But it's a game, right? Of course
it's all simplified and easy.
That makes it more fun.
Sinon
1050057_22_a
I think I let that go to my head.
I'm so embarrassed with myself...
Liz
1050057_21_a
The rest is just watching the
chance of success and hoping
for the best.
Liz
1050057_20_a
In most VRMMOs, smithing is just
raising your levels, getting mats,
and smacking them with a hammer.
Liz
1050057_19_a
Liz...
Sinon
1050057_18_a
But a real swordsmith's on a whole
different level!
Liz
1050057_17_a
I made a name for myself as a
smith in SAO and ALO, so I have
some confidence in my skill...
Liz
1050057_16_a
I'm amazed that this sort of
technique was passed down in
Japan for over a thousand years.
Liz
1050057_15_a
It's WAY harder work than
I thought, and requires a
meticulous eye for detail.
Liz
1050057_14_a
Liz
1050057_13_a
How's it going, Liz?
Sinon
1050057_12_a
Y-Yes, sir!
Liz
1050057_11_a
Great, now we fold it over.
Don't let any air in.
Master Bladesmith
1050057_10_a
Understood!
Liz
1050057_9_a
Liz
1050057_8_a
Each spot needs a different sort
of swing! Pay close attention!
Master Bladesmith
1050057_7_a
Looks like a tough job...
Sinon
1050057_6_a
S-Sorry!
Liz
1050057_5_a
That was too weak! Harder!
Master Bladesmith
1050057_4_a
Y-Yes, sir!
Liz
1050057_3_a
You're hitting too hard!
Ease up a little!
Master Bladesmith
1050057_2_a
bg_07_lisbeth_smith_work
Hyah!
Liz
1050057_1_a
Yes, sir!
Liz
1050055_18_a
Listen up! I'll teach you as we
go, but don't screw up!
Master Bladesmith
1050055_17_a
Ehehe, was it that obvious?
Liz
1050055_16_a
I'm happy for you, Liz. You
looked like you were itching to
grab a hammer this whole time.
Sinon
1050055_15_a
Great.
Master Bladesmith
1050055_14_a
Y-Yes! Yes yes yes!
I'd love to help!!
Liz
1050055_13_a
Truth is, I was looking for an
apprentice to back me up today.
Looks like you're it.
Master Bladesmith
1050055_12_a
I need you to be my assistant.
Swing the second hammer on
my order.
Master Bladesmith
1050055_11_a
Yeah. I can't do it all myself.
This is a two-person job.
Master Bladesmith
1050055_10_a
What?! Really?!
You mean it?!
Liz
1050055_9_a
Oh, I've got an idea.
Want to help me out?
Master Bladesmith
1050055_8_a
Liz...? You okay?
Sinon
1050055_7_a
Yeah...
Liz
1050055_6_a
The clang-clang smash it with a
hammer part, right?
Sinon
1050055_5_a
The whole process is so
incredible... And all this
leads to the final forging.
Master Bladesmith
1050055_4_a
Liz
1050055_3_a
Sinon
1050055_2_a
bg_07_lisbeth_smith_work
So next, we cool the iron and
break it into chunks...
Master Bladesmith
1050055_1_a
Sure thing. This way.
Master Bladesmith
1050053_21_a
Is it all right if we moved on to
the next part of the process?
I want to see it all!
Liz
1050053_20_a
O-Okay, I'll hold my applause.
Sinon
1050053_19_a
We've only just brushed the
surface here. Making a katana is
an intricate and amazing process!
Master Bladesmith
1050053_18_a
Well, girls, it's still too early
to be shocked and awed.
Master Bladesmith
1050053_17_a
I'm glad to see it recreated so
accurately. Traditional crafts are
disappearing in the real world.
Sinon
1050053_16_a
I've read a bit about how all this
works, but I never realized just
how dangerous it was...
Liz
1050053_15_a
Wow... So working here doesn't
just put you at risk of burns,
but also a searing, melty death...
Liz
1050053_14_a
A th-thousand?!
Sinon
1050053_13_a
It's bearable because this is VR,
but in the real world it gets to
over 1,000 degrees. Celsius.
Master Bladesmith
1050053_12_a
Yup. We chuck in iron sand and
melt it into tamahagane. That's
the stuff we use to make katanas.
Master Bladesmith
1050053_11_a
That huge furnace-thing there is
used to melt down iron?
Sinon
1050053_10_a
Be my guest.
Master Bladesmith
1050053_9_a
Whoa! You're already my hero!
Mind if I watch you guys work?!
Liz
1050053_8_a
I'm the guy in charge of this
furnace! The resident Master
Bladesmith, at your service!
???
1050053_7_a
Hello there. And you are?
Sinon
1050053_6_a
Of course it's hot!
What were you expecting?
???
1050053_5_a
Means it's solar flare-level
hot in here!
Liz
1050053_4_a
For sure! Heat sensitivity is
turned way down in VR, so for
us to be feeling it like this...
Liz
1050053_3_a
Liz
1050053_2_a
bg_07_lisbeth_smith_work
It's hot in here...
Sinon
1050053_1_a
Thanks!
Liz
1050051_15_a
Well, I'm happy to keep you
company. Let's go.
Sinon
1050051_14_a
Liz
1050051_13_a
In the real world, good katanas
are priceless antiques valued by
collectors all over the globe.
Liz
1050051_12_a
Oh, totally. They make katanas
there! Katanas aren't just
weapons, they're art!
Liz
1050051_11_a
Heh, I can see you
hyperventilating over the
chance to play with it.
Sinon
1050051_10_a
Yup! But this is a Japanese-themed
VRMMO. I bet it's much more
detailed and realistic here!
Liz
1050051_9_a
Sounds interesting. Wasn't there
something like that in Leprechaun
territory in ALO, though?
Sinon
1050051_8_a
I'm a Bladesmith here, so I just
HAVE to go check it out!
Liz
1050051_7_a
You got it! It's this traditional
Japanese design they used
waaay back in the day.
Liz
1050051_6_a
A tatara furnace? Is that some
sort of specialized thing for
blacksmithing?
Sinon
1050051_5_a
Great! It's a smithy with a tatara
furnace a little ways up this
mountain.
Liz
1050051_4_a
Sure. I don't mind.
Sinon
1050051_3_a
Sinon
1050051_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Hey Sinon, there's this place I
want to check out. Mind if we
head there for a bit?
Liz
1050051_1_a
Absolutely!
Sinon
1050048_18_a
You'll help, right?
Liz
1050048_17_a
No use crying over smashed
sculptures, though! It's time
to make more!
Liz
1050048_16_a
I appreciate your concern, Sinon.
Liz
1050048_15_a
Liz?
Sinon
1050048_14_a
In fact, it's probably better that
these got wrecked...
Liz
1050048_13_a
This was the risk I took when I
made these sculptures outside
the safe zone.
Liz
1050048_12_a
Don't worry about it! You were
fighting off monsters, and I can
just redo the sculptures later.
Liz
1050048_11_a
I'm sorry, Liz. You worked so hard
on all of these.
Sinon
1050048_10_a
...
Liz
1050048_9_a
Were they supposed to be
people or something? They're so
busted I can't even tell anymore.
Sinon
1050048_8_a
Me? N-No, of course not.
Sinon
1050048_7_a
Oh no... You didn't...happen to
see any of them, did you, Sinon?
Before they broke, I mean.
Liz
1050048_6_a
Monsters just attacked, and these
sculptures got smashed in the
ensuing fight.
Sinon
1050048_5_a
Bad news, Liz...
Sinon
1050048_4_a
Wh-What...?! Sinon!
Liz
1050048_3_a
Oh no...
They got smashed!
Sinon
1050048_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Are the little Kirito and Liz
sculptures okay?
Sinon
1050048_1_a
Hm?
Player
1050047_22_a
Ah!
Sinon
1050047_21_a
Yeah. I'll have to break the news
to Liz...
Sinon
1050047_20_a
The players are safe, sure,
but the ice sculptures didn't
fare so well...
Player
1050047_19_a
Don't mention it.
I'm glad everyone's safe.
Sinon
1050047_18_a
Thank you, archer!
Player
1050047_17_a
Whew. That's the last of them.
Sinon
1050047_16_a
Graaaaaagh!
Monster
1050047_15_a
Just one left!
Sinon
1050047_14_a
Sinon
1050047_13_a
Graaaawwwwwrrrrr!
Monster
1050047_12_a
Great. Sounds like we didn't get
them all the first time around.
Sinon
1050047_11_a
The monsters are attacking again!
Lots of them! Somebody help!
Player
1050047_10_a
Yes, that's it!
Sinon
1050047_9_a
Help!
???
1050047_8_a
Are they supposed to be...
Kirito and Liz?!
Sinon
1050047_7_a
The exaggerated proportions are
cute, but what's the motif here?
Sinon
1050047_6_a
Heh, cute. They're little
ice sculpture caricatures.
Sinon
1050047_5_a
Wait, what're these little things
behind the larger sculptures?
Sinon
1050047_4_a
What is she mumbling about?
Liz, are you okay?
Sinon
1050047_3_a
...
Liz
1050047_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
...
Liz
1050047_1_a
Heh heh heh...
Liz
1050045_19_a
Oh, wow! I'll go take a look.
Kirito
1050045_18_a
Sure is! We're making a castle and
a demon too. They're lined up
over there.
Liz
1050045_17_a
What do you mean by "pretty much
done"? Is there something besides
the dragon?
Kirito
1050045_16_a
I will, but we're pretty much done
already.
Liz
1050045_15_a
Heh, I see. Well, let me know if
there's anything I can do to help.
Kirito
1050045_14_a
I did the initial chiseling and
helped out with other small tasks.
Sinon
1050045_13_a
What we ended up with is
simplified, but no less labor-
intensive.
Sinon
1050045_12_a
Well, it is impressive.
Kirito
1050045_11_a
Sinon, bookworm that she is,
researched dragons so I'd be
sure to get the look right.
Liz
1050045_10_a
That's true...
Kirito
1050045_9_a
Besides, who doesn't love a cool
dragon?
Liz
1050045_8_a
We figured ice sculptures work
best with beasts and characters
from fantasy stories.
Liz
1050045_7_a
Made is a strong word. I helped.
Sinon
1050045_6_a
You guys shoved me in front of
them! But whatever. You made
this ice sculpture, right, Sinon?
Kirito
1050045_5_a
Oh, good! Kirito finally escaped
his adoring fans.
Sinon
1050045_4_a
Say what?
Kirito
1050045_3_a
Kirito
1050045_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Oh, and Sinon helped too.
Liz
1050045_1_a
Wow...
Kirito
1050043_18_a
We get buffs that raise our chance
of crafting success, making it
easier to craft what we envision!
Liz
1050043_17_a
You'd think that. But, as a
blacksmith, I've got a leg up.
Liz
1050043_16_a
Even so, there's no way this
was easy.
Kirito
1050043_15_a
Sure did! I'm good with my hands.
Liz
1050043_14_a
Did you make this?
Kirito
1050043_13_a
Whaddya think? It's a pretty
good dragon, right?
Liz
1050043_12_a
Liz?
Kirito
1050043_11_a
Hey, Kirito!
Liz
1050043_10_a
Is that an ice sculpture?
Kirito
1050043_9_a
What the heck?!
Kirito
1050043_8_a
Did one of the dragons I just
fought survive?!
Kirito
1050043_7_a
What?!
Kirito
1050043_6_a
Dragon! It's a dragon!!
???
1050043_5_a
Wait, where DID everyone go?
Kirito
1050043_4_a
But now they're gone just as fast
as they rushed up to me.
Kirito
1050043_3_a
What was it about this fight
that got everyone's attention?
Kirito
1050043_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Man, all I did was get rid of the
same monsters as always.
Kirito
1050043_1_a
Great! I'll go get started.
Liz
1050041_16_a
Well, yeah, it won't take as long
as the real thing, but...
Sinon
1050041_15_a
We're already pretty strong,
and we can even fly!
Liz
1050041_14_a
Almost no time at all. This is VR!
We can take shortcuts! Probably!
Liz
1050041_13_a
You do know how long that would
take, don't you?
Sinon
1050041_12_a
Exactly!
Liz
1050041_11_a
You mean you want to make
giant snow and ice sculptures?
Sinon
1050041_10_a
Let's see, what can we do...?
Ooh! Let's pretend it's the
Sapporo Snow Festival!
Liz
1050041_9_a
I just want to make the most out
of this place. We don't get to do
this every day!
Liz
1050041_8_a
You've got stamina, I'll say that.
Sinon
1050041_7_a
You think? I could totally go
another round!
Liz
1050041_6_a
We could always have one more
match, but I think I need a break.
Sinon
1050041_5_a
I can't believe the whole thing
ended in a 5-5 tie!
Liz
1050041_4_a
Hehe, it sure was.
Sinon
1050041_3_a
Sinon
1050041_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Man, that was so much fun!
Liz
1050041_1_a
Hahaha! Okay, then.
That's enough for me!
Silica
1050038_24_a
Heh. Who said I was going to tell
them what I found in the first
place?
Liz
1050038_23_a
If the Leprechauns find out what
it does, they'll be mad at you for
giving it away!
Silica
1050038_22_a
Sounds good! Are you sure you want
to give it to them, though?
Silica
1050038_21_a
True. Right, let's get this to
Kirito and the others. I'm sure
they'll be thrilled!
Liz
1050038_20_a
Well, it was a really tough
dungeon after all!
Silica
1050038_19_a
It'd be worth a shot. I'm just
impressed that we found such
an awesome item down here.
Liz
1050038_18_a
Ooh! Do you think that would help
reverse the Divine Object's curse?
Silica
1050038_17_a
Let's see what it says here...
Looks like it greatly reduces
monster encounters.
Liz
1050038_16_a
Huh... Is this some sort of amulet
or something?
Liz
1050038_15_a
item_03_treasure_box
A treasure chest appeared!
Let's open it!
Silica
1050038_14_a
Silica
1050038_13_a
Woohoo! We did it! We cleared
the entire dungeon!
Liz
1050038_12_a
Yeah! Let's not lose our momentum!
Liz
1050038_11_a
We did it! That was a great
idea, Liz!
Silica
1050038_10_a
GULGHAAAAH!
Monster
1050038_9_a
Now for my second attack!
Liz
1050038_8_a
I'm on it!
YAAAAAH!
Silica
1050038_7_a
You're up, Silica! Switch!
Liz
1050038_6_a
That worked! I didn't get
staggered at all!
Liz
1050038_5_a
HYAAAAAH!
Liz
1050038_4_a
Silica
1050038_3_a
Liz
1050038_2_a
bg_12_bi_palace
GRAAAHHHH!
Monster
1050038_1_a
Yeah! This might be the key!
Silica
1050037_23_a
And as long as we can activate
the technique, it'll deal massive
damage, which is what counts!
Liz
1050037_22_a
Exactly! That should buy us enough
time to start the next phase of
our attack!
Liz
1050037_21_a
Ooh! And what we lose in attack,
we make up for with a faster
recovery time!
Silica
1050037_20_a
Power isn't everything, Silica!
If we make them slightly less
powerful, they also get lighter!
Liz
1050037_19_a
But our weapons have already
been enhanced to their limits...
Haven't they?
Silica
1050037_18_a
This calls for my smithing skill.
I can alter the equipment we
already have!
Liz
1050037_17_a
What's that?
Silica
1050037_16_a
We may not be able to swap
equipment outright, but I think
there's another way!
Liz
1050037_15_a
What? Did you think of something?
Silica
1050037_14_a
Yeah, unfortunately that won't...
Actually, hang on!
Liz
1050037_13_a
But it doesn't sound like that's
an option.
Silica
1050037_12_a
we might be able to buy enough
time after the enemy attacks to
set up our switch.
Silica
1050037_11_a
Me too... I just thought if there
was a piece of equipment we had
that prevented staggering,
Silica
1050037_10_a
No way. I'm already using the most
powerful weapon I have.
Liz
1050037_9_a
Do you have any weapons that could
stand up to the monsters on this
floor?
Silica
1050037_8_a
O-Okay. Let's see, um...
Silica
1050037_7_a
I know how you feel, but I'm not
ready to give up yet. Let's put
our heads together.
Liz
1050037_6_a
We probably won't get too much
farther if we can't use that
technique!
Silica
1050037_5_a
Got it...
We're in a tough spot, aren't we?
Silica
1050037_4_a
We need a strategy before it
finds us.
Liz
1050037_3_a
Silica
1050037_2_a
bg_12_bi_palace
Phew. Okay, my magic will hide us
from it for now, but it won't last
forever.
Liz
1050037_1_a
Urgh!
Liz
1050035_21_a
And if we can't parry, we can't
switch... This doesn't look good!
Silica
1050035_20_a
The recovery time after our first
attack is way too long!
Liz
1050035_19_a
Okay, this one means business...
Liz
1050035_18_a
GAHAHA!
Monster
1050035_17_a
Silica!
Liz
1050035_16_a
AAH!
Silica
1050035_15_a
GRAAAAGH!
Monster
1050035_14_a
My turn, then! HYAH!
Silica
1050035_13_a
I-I'm fine! I've survived worse.
Liz
1050035_12_a
Liz! Are you okay?!
Silica
1050035_11_a
Ungh!
Liz
1050035_10_a
RAWWWRRR!
Monster
1050035_9_a
Here goes! RAAAAH!
Liz
1050035_8_a
Okay!
Silica
1050035_7_a
Okay, Silica! Time to employ our
new technique, just like we did
on the other floors!
Liz
1050035_6_a
Hehe, and the monsters show up to
greet us in record time!
Liz
1050035_5_a
Graaarrrrr!
Monster
1050035_4_a
Yeah! Just two more floors to go!
Silica
1050035_3_a
Silica
1050035_2_a
bg_12_bi_palace
Woo! We made it to Floor 29!
Liz
1050035_1_a
It's possible. But somehow I don't
think that'll solve all of their
problems...
Liz
1050033_28_a
True! Maybe they can fend the
monsters off with Asuna's new
technique!
Silica
1050033_27_a
Ordinarily I'd agree, but we're
talking about Kirito and the gang.
They'll think of something.
Liz
1050033_26_a
This is bad! We have to warn them!
Silica
1050033_25_a
The curse is still active, right?
Won't it hurt Kirito and the
others?
Silica
1050033_24_a
Well, that's good.
But, wait a second...
Silica
1050033_23_a
Things have more or less calmed
down. We all agree we shouldn't
hang onto it.
Liz
1050033_22_a
What happened in the end?
Silica
1050033_21_a
Even Rain and I got roped into
their big debate, so that tells
you how big of a deal it was.
Liz
1050033_20_a
Yeah. And even after it was all
done, a few Leprechauns said
we should've kept it.
Liz
1050033_19_a
Wow. That's quite a story!
Silica
1050033_18_a
Kirito ended up convincing the
other Leprechauns it was too
dangerous for them to keep.
Liz
1050033_17_a
Strap in! It gets crazier. The
Divine Object is cursed or
something. It attracts monsters!
Liz
1050033_16_a
Oh my gosh, that's crazy!
Silica
1050033_15_a
when
wouldn't ya know it
Kirito
and his crew came to take it. The
whole thing turned into a mess.
Liz
1050033_14_a
We started studying it because we
knew people would be after it,
Liz
1050033_13_a
Right. Well, we found one in
Leprechaun territory.
Liz
1050033_12_a
Y-Yes, I have. There are seven
of them in total, right?
Silica
1050033_11_a
Wait, you've heard about the
Divine Objects, right?
Liz
1050033_10_a
Ah, it was one of the Divine
Objects that Alice and Eugeo
have been looking for.
Liz
1050033_9_a
What kind of rare item?
Silica
1050033_8_a
The Leprechauns came across a
rare item that ended up being
more trouble than it was worth.
Liz
1050033_7_a
Oh, that? Yeah, it's all good.
Don't worry about it.
Liz
1050033_6_a
Did everything turn out all right?
Silica
1050033_5_a
I, uh, haven't been asking you to
join me lately because you said
you were busy...
Silica
1050033_4_a
What's up?
Liz
1050033_3_a
Liz
1050033_2_a
bg_12_bi_palace
Can I ask you something?
Silica
1050033_1_a
L-Liz! Wait up!
Silica
1050031_16_a
Let's keep this crazy train
rolling!
Liz
1050031_15_a
Fair enough, but with this
tactic in our toolkit, we're
ready for anything!
Liz
1050031_14_a
We still have to get through the
next three floors!
Silica
1050031_13_a
I think the chances are pretty
high, but we can't get complacent.
Silica
1050031_12_a
Hehe, how much do you wanna bet
we'll be the first party of two
to clear this area?
Liz
1050031_11_a
Absolutely. Okay, so we've made it
to Floor 28 of the underground.
Our intel says it goes to 30.
Silica
1050031_10_a
This crazy hard dungeon would've
eaten us alive without it. No
question.
Liz
1050031_9_a
I'm tempted to say we've
mastered it!
Silica
1050031_8_a
Yes, you are! The switch technique
Asuna taught us is really useful!
Silica
1050031_7_a
Heh, I'm starting to get the hang
of this!
Liz
1050031_6_a
Gyaaaggghh!
Monster
1050031_5_a
Now to act like I'm retreating...
and let 'em have it!
Liz
1050031_4_a
Okay!
Silica
1050031_3_a
Silica
1050031_2_a
bg_12_bi_palace
Switch, Silica!
Liz
1050031_1_a
Hahahaha, fine, fine.
Yuuki
1050018_28_a
Ooh, just stop already! My face is
red enough as it is!
Leafa
1050018_27_a
That's why it was so easy for that
vampire to pick off his victims.
Yuuki
1050018_26_a
Hehe, but you know, it's nothing
to be ashamed of. Everyone
falls in love with someone.
Yuuki
1050018_25_a
Oh, good... Thanks.
Leafa
1050018_24_a
Hehehe, I know. I won't tell
anyone, don't worry.
Yuuki
1050018_23_a
Um... So, Yuuki, about the
illusion I saw...
Leafa
1050018_22_a
Thanks, Leafa. It wasn't really
much of a fight once its
glamor was out of the picture.
Yuuki
1050018_21_a
Yuuki
1050018_20_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
Nice job, Yuuki.
Leafa
1050018_19_a
bg_black
Yuuki
1050018_18_a
Sink your teeth into THIS!
Yuuki
1050018_17_a
Give it up already. You've drank
your last drop of blood!
Yuuki
1050018_16_a
Gaaaaaaaahhh!
Vampire
1050018_15_a
Since I don't have anyone I'm in
love with yet, that won't work
on me!
Yuuki
1050018_14_a
You rifle through their memories
and trace an image of that person
over yourself.
Yuuki
1050018_13_a
Your "glamor"-your little
trick-is appearing as your
victim's love interest.
Yuuki
1050018_12_a
The info she gave me, coupled with
the reactions of your other victims,
helped me piece it together.
Yuuki
1050018_11_a
Once Leafa told me about what
happened, I knew I'd be totally
fine.
Yuuki
1050018_10_a
Vhat?!
Vampire
1050018_9_a
Hehe, thought so. A big fat load
of nothing.
Yuuki
1050018_8_a
...
Yuuki
1050018_7_a
Yaaaaah!
Vampire
1050018_6_a
Mwahaha... Oh, you'll be offering
it to me after a taste of this
glamor...
Vampire
1050018_5_a
Just try and take it!
Yuuki
1050018_4_a
Your blood is mine!!
Vampire
1050018_3_a
Yuuki
1050018_2_a
bg_04_town_inn
Mwahaha... Yet another young fool
lost in my domain.
Vampire
1050018_1_a
Huh?
Yuuki
1050017_23_a
It's kind of embarrassing, but...
I know you're gonna need
this info to defeat it...
Leafa
1050017_22_a
Um... Yuuki... I'll tell you.
Leafa
1050017_21_a
I'm gonna take down that vampire
no matter what!
Yuuki
1050017_20_a
That's okay. If there's a reason
why you can't tell me, I
understand. I'm not giving up.
Yuuki
1050017_19_a
...!
Leafa
1050017_18_a
You're not going to say anything
either? Just like that other
victim?
Yuuki
1050017_17_a
...
Leafa
1050017_16_a
Huh?
Yuuki
1050017_15_a
Yeah... It...yeah...
Leafa
1050017_14_a
Did it pin your arms behind your
back too? Were you unable to
attack back?
Yuuki
1050017_13_a
Yeah... It sucked my blood...
Leafa
1050017_12_a
What? Wait, did it get you?
Yuuki
1050017_11_a
I-It disappeared off somewhere...
Leafa
1050017_10_a
Why are you on the ground? Are you
all right? Where's the vampire?
Yuuki
1050017_9_a
Hey, Yuuki...
Leafa
1050017_8_a
Leafa!
Yuuki
1050017_7_a
...
Leafa
1050017_6_a
Alright, found it! I'm on my way,
Leafa!
Yuuki
1050017_5_a
She says the vampire showed up!
Let's see, where is this place...?
Yuuki
1050017_4_a
Hey, speak of the devil! She just
sent me a message!
Yuuki
1050017_3_a
I hope Leafa's faring better than
I am...
Yuuki
1050017_2_a
bg_04_town_inn
Hmmm... I've been looking for
nearly an hour, and I still
haven't seen a single soul...
Yuuki
1050017_1_a
You too, Leafa!
Yuuki
1050015_19_a
Got it. Good luck, Yuuki!
Leafa
1050015_18_a
If anything happens, we'll call
each other over ASAP, okay?
Yuuki
1050015_17_a
Well, at least now we've got a pin
for the general area it shows up.
Let's split up and check it out.
Yuuki
1050015_16_a
I wonder if something bad happened
that's hard for her to talk
about...
Leafa
1050015_15_a
Exactly! But she's the victim
here. Why wouldn't she tell
us everything?
Yuuki
1050015_14_a
Yeah, I got the feeling she was
holding something back too.
Leafa
1050015_13_a
Well, she didn't have much to say
that was useful... Actually, she
didn't have much to say at all.
Yuuki
1050015_12_a
bg_04_town_inn
What do you think, Yuuki?
Leafa
1050015_11_a
Oh...
Yuuki
1050015_10_a
It happened so fast, and I was so
shocked, I just kind of...froze...
I couldn't move a muscle.
Girl
1050015_9_a
...
Girl
1050015_8_a
Well... You see...
Girl
1050015_7_a
I'd have thought you'd have some
chance of attacking it once it
appeared in front of you.
Yuuki
1050015_6_a
Did you try to fight it off?
Leafa
1050015_5_a
My HP started draining, but I
didn't get hit with any status
ailment or anything else.
Girl
1050015_4_a
Yuuki
1050015_3_a
Leafa
1050015_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
I was out walking last night
when it attacked me and...
and sucked my blood...
Girl
1050015_1_a
...
Girl
1050013_19_a
I was hoping you'd be able to tell
us more about what happened
when the vampire attacked you.
Yuuki
1050013_18_a
Oh... Hi.
Girl
1050013_17_a
You're right.
Um, excuse me. I messaged
you earlier. My name's Yuuki.
Yuuki
1050013_16_a
...
Girl
1050013_15_a
Hey, maybe that's her?
Leafa
1050013_14_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
One of the vampire's victims ought
to be around here, according to
her SNS info...
Yuuki
1050013_13_a
Yeah!
Leafa
1050013_12_a
Hehe, you know it!
Let's go hunt us a vampire!
Yuuki
1050013_11_a
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Leafa
1050013_10_a
Yeah. Normally players can counter
with spells or weapons before a
monster gets too close.
Yuuki
1050013_9_a
You hardly ever have a situation
where you have to wrestle your
way to victory.
Leafa
1050013_8_a
Me neither. Fighting with swords
and magic is what ALO is
built on.
Leafa
1050013_7_a
I don't get why it would pin your
arms behind your back.
Yuuki
1050013_6_a
The blood-sucking probably only
deals normal damage and maybe
a status ailment, but...
Yuuki
1050013_5_a
About the vampire who pins your
arms behind your back and drinks
your blood?
Yuuki
1050013_4_a
Hey, Yuuki... What do you make
of what that girl said?
Leafa
1050013_3_a
Leafa
1050013_2_a
bg_02_fountain
...
Yuuki
1050013_1_a
What?!
Yuuki
1050011_22_a
Nope... It attacks players in the
exact same way.
Girl
1050011_21_a
But it only does that to NPCs,
right?
Yuuki
1050011_20_a
That sounds just like something
out of classic vampire legends.
Leafa
1050011_19_a
They say it pins your arms behind
you as it sinks its fangs into
your neck and drinks your blood!
Girl
1050011_18_a
Apparently it was only lying
dormant, because they're saying
people have been attacked again.
Girl
1050011_17_a
Y-Yeah, I heard that too...
Leafa
1050011_16_a
A vampire? I thought that it
stopped attacking players once
the castle had been beaten...
Yuuki
1050011_15_a
A terrible creature that appears
night after night, hunting in the
dark for young blood...
Girl
1050011_14_a
You don't know? Lately it's all
anyone can talk about around
here...
Girl
1050011_13_a
And what would that be?
Leafa
1050011_12_a
I know it looks peaceful now, but
there's something terrible lurking
within the Dread Bastion.
Girl
1050011_11_a
Huh?
Yuuki
1050011_10_a
I'm not so sure about that.
???
1050011_9_a
Exactly!
Yuuki
1050011_8_a
It almost feels like we're just
hanging out at a theme park.
Leafa
1050011_7_a
Hehe, you can say that again. The
monsters aren't even that bad
now that we've beat it.
Leafa
1050011_6_a
Plus everything's all decorated
for Halloween, and there's lots of
dungeons. Everything is awesome!
Yuuki
1050011_5_a
There are all sorts of demons and
weird monsters in this castle.
Yuuki
1050011_4_a
What's up, Yuuki?
You're in a good mood.
Leafa
1050011_3_a
Leafa
1050011_2_a
bg_02_fountain
Heh heh heeeeh.
Yuuki
1050011_1_a
Th-That's not a promising sound...
Kirito
1040298_60_a
Leafa
1040298_59_a
Asuna
1040298_58_a
Kirito
1040298_57_a
AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Liz
1040298_56_a
Okay!
Silica
1040298_55_a
So you guys just watch me!
Liz
1040298_54_a
Silica
1040298_53_a
Sinon
1040298_52_a
I'm fine... I can do it!
You're mine, material!
Liz
1040298_51_a
Leafa
1040298_50_a
Kirito
1040298_49_a
Umm... Liz, I know you're trying
to sound cool, but you're visibly
trembling...
Asuna
1040298_48_a
A true master crafter would travel
to the ends of the earth to get
a rare material.
Liz
1040298_47_a
Heh... Hehe...
A girl's gotta have pluck, and a
blacksmith's gotta be tough.
Liz
1040298_46_a
Sinon
1040298_45_a
Liz
1040298_44_a
Liz, you're my hero!
Silica
1040298_43_a
Asuna
1040298_42_a
Kirito
1040298_41_a
Liz... I'm speechless!
You're so courageous!
Leafa
1040298_40_a
Silica
1040298_39_a
Sinon
1040298_38_a
No, Sinon, he's right. I'll do it.
Besides, I saw where it is
now I just have to grab it.
Liz
1040298_37_a
Leafa
1040298_36_a
Asuna
1040298_35_a
No, seriously! Why is this my job?!
Kirito
1040298_34_a
Well, that means we only have one
option left. Get up there, Kirito.
Sinon
1040298_33_a
But...I couldn't get it.
I was going too fast, and I was
half-paralyzed with fear to boot.
Liz
1040298_32_a
Silica
1040298_31_a
Sinon
1040298_30_a
Yeah... It was right smack-dab
in the middle of that slide...
Liz
1040298_29_a
Leafa
1040298_28_a
Kirito
1040298_27_a
N-Noted...
Did you find that item?
Asuna
1040298_26_a
Sinon
1040298_25_a
Silica
1040298_24_a
NO, I AM NOT OKAY! I WAS
SCARED OUT OF MY MIND!!
Liz
1040298_23_a
Leafa
1040298_22_a
Asuna
1040298_21_a
Are you okay, Liz?
Kirito
1040298_20_a
Silica
1040298_19_a
Sinon
1040298_18_a
pant
... 
pant
...
I-I thought I was done for...
Liz
1040298_17_a
Sinon
1040298_16_a
Let's go!
Silica
1040298_15_a
Kirito
1040298_14_a
Asuna
1040298_13_a
Look, it's Liz! She's coming
out the bottom!
Leafa
1040298_12_a
Silica
1040298_11_a
Liz has some serious guts.
I'm impressed she worked up the
nerve, despite being that scared.
Sinon
1040298_10_a
Leafa
1040298_9_a
Kirito
1040298_8_a
Yup... I can't believe we can hear
her from all the way over here.
She must be terrified.
Asuna
1040298_7_a
That...sounds like Liz screaming.
Kirito
1040298_6_a
HEEEEEELLLP MEEE!!!
Liz
1040298_5_a
Leafa
1040298_4_a
Asuna
1040298_3_a
Kirito
1040298_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Liz
1040298_1_a
You can do it!
We believe in you!
Silica
1040297_81_a
Sinon
1040297_80_a
Silica
1040297_79_a
Ugh, I knew this would happen...
Liz
1040297_78_a
So we're settled, then.
Liz is going to have to take
on that water slide.
Kirito
1040297_77_a
Leafa
1040297_76_a
Kirito
1040297_75_a
Hehe, that's so like you, Liz.
You have a true MMOer's spirit!
Asuna
1040297_74_a
It'd be selfish of me to ask you
to get it for me. This is my
problem and my responsibility.
Liz
1040297_73_a
Sinon
1040297_72_a
Silica
1040297_71_a
B-But I'm the one who needs this
item, not you guys.
Liz
1040297_70_a
Whoa whoa whoa!
Why is this my job now?
Kirito
1040297_69_a
I'm sure Kirito would happily
slide down that giant, scary
slide for you!
Leafa
1040297_68_a
Asuna
1040297_67_a
Kirito
1040297_66_a
You should have just told us!
Leafa
1040297_65_a
Ahaha... I think you guessed
right.
Silica
1040297_64_a
Sinon
1040297_63_a
Silica
1040297_62_a
Eeep!
Liz
1040297_61_a
Leafa
1040297_60_a
Asuna
1040297_59_a
Liz... Let me hazard a guess.
You're scared of water slides,
aren't you?
Kirito
1040297_58_a
Sinon
1040297_57_a
Silica
1040297_56_a
Y-Yeah. Hehe...
Liz
1040297_55_a
Leafa
1040297_54_a
Kirito
1040297_53_a
So that's why you gave up?
Asuna
1040297_52_a
Well, the slide's REALLY fast...
There's no way we can spot and
grab a material on the way down.
Liz
1040297_51_a
That's some suspicious phrasing.
You knew, didn't you?
Why didn't you say?
Sinon
1040297_50_a
Sinon
1040297_49_a
Silica
1040297_48_a
Ahaha... Yeah, so you see the
problem...
Liz
1040297_47_a
Which means we'll have to somehow
grab the item while we're going
down the slide.
Kirito
1040297_46_a
Leafa
1040297_45_a
Asuna
1040297_44_a
I compared the quest map to this
park's map and it seems like
that's the case.
Kirito
1040297_43_a
This is right in the middle of
that super-long waterslide!
Silica
1040297_42_a
Urk...!
Liz
1040297_41_a
Sinon
1040297_40_a
Liz
1040297_39_a
Let me see... This is
NO WAY!
Silica
1040297_38_a
Wait, there's still one place we
haven't checked. This one.
Kirito
1040297_37_a
Leafa
1040297_36_a
Asuna
1040297_35_a
...
Kirito
1040297_34_a
So, what does that mean?
There's a gather point not
listed on the map?
Sinon
1040297_33_a
Silica
1040297_32_a
Sinon
1040297_31_a
Yeah... We did...
Liz
1040297_30_a
Kirito
1040297_29_a
Leafa
1040297_28_a
But we did check pretty much
everywhere on this quest map,
right?
Asuna
1040297_27_a
Guys...
Liz
1040297_26_a
Liz
1040297_25_a
Sinon
1040297_24_a
Yeah!
Silica
1040297_23_a
Kirito
1040297_22_a
Asuna
1040297_21_a
It's no trouble at all! We're all
more than happy to help you
look for that last item!
Leafa
1040297_20_a
I didn't want to rain on
everyone's parade just
to make you help me...
Liz
1040297_19_a
W-Well, everyone worked so hard
gathering materials...
Liz
1040297_18_a
Silica
1040297_17_a
Liz
1040297_16_a
Hey, you're right.
Liz, why didn't you say something?
Sinon
1040297_15_a
We're missing the final piece we
need to enhance Liz's mace.
Kirito
1040297_14_a
Leafa
1040297_13_a
Kirito
1040297_12_a
We are?
Asuna
1040297_11_a
Yup, we're one item short.
Kirito
1040297_10_a
One of these, two of those...
Kirito
1040297_9_a
Leafa
1040297_8_a
Asuna
1040297_7_a
Hold up. Liz, I distinctly heard
you say "almost" there a second
ago.
Kirito
1040297_6_a
Y-Yeah...
Liz
1040297_5_a
We'll be able to enhance
everyone's D-weapons now!
Silica
1040297_4_a
Sinon
1040297_3_a
Silica
1040297_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
Thanks for the help, everyone!
We have almost everything we need!
Liz
1040297_1_a
Leafa
1040295_38_a
I find that very hard to believe.
Sinon
1040295_37_a
Asuna
1040295_36_a
W-We won't! We're taking
this seriously, okay?!
Kirito
1040295_35_a
Leafa
1040295_34_a
Yeah yeah, just don't start
giggling and playfully splashing
water at each other or something.
Sinon
1040295_33_a
And bonus! We get to test the
waters! Two birds with one stone!
Kirito
1040295_32_a
Kirito
1040295_31_a
That seems pretty likely.
Let's hop in and take a look.
Asuna
1040295_30_a
I took a quick look around, but I
didn't see anything. Maybe they're
in the thermal pool?
Leafa
1040295_29_a
Leafa
1040295_28_a
sigh
Nice try. No one's buying
it. Anyway, let's find those rocks.
Where do we start?
Sinon
1040295_27_a
Asuna
1040295_26_a
N-No we weren't! H-Hey, look
at the time! Those materials
won't collect themselves!
Kirito
1040295_25_a
Sinon
1040295_24_a
You two were lost in your own
sugar-sweet world of love for a
minute... Bleck.
Leafa
1040295_23_a
Sinon
1040295_22_a
Ah! Sinonon! Wh-When did y
I-I mean, I knew that!
Asuna
1040295_21_a
Leafa
1040295_20_a
Hey, Earth to lovebirds.
You realize we can all
hear you, right?
Sinon
1040295_19_a
Y-Yeah. That sounds like fun.
Asuna
1040295_18_a
J-Just to test the water...
Kirito
1040295_17_a
H-Hey, Asuna... If we have time
later, want to take a dip?
Just the two of us?
Kirito
1040295_16_a
Well "thermal" means "hot," so
duh. At least it's mixed gender,
unlike most hot springs.
Asuna
1040295_15_a
Asuna
1040295_14_a
Here we are, the thermal pool.
After the refreshing regular pool,
this place just feels...steamy.
Kirito
1040295_13_a
Oh yeah!
Let's get this show on the road!
Liz
1040295_12_a
Everyone there's floating along at
a snail's pace, so I think we've
found our collection spot!
Silica
1040295_11_a
Hehe, looks that way.
I guess it's a good way to
get some light exercise.
Liz
1040295_10_a
You're right. I guess that's
a walking lane?
Silica
1040295_9_a
Hey, look over there, Silica.
People in that lane are just
kind of wading.
Liz
1040295_8_a
You're right. We shouldn't
interfere with people's practice.
Silica
1040295_7_a
So, what do we do? I don't think
we can just jump in. We'd be
completely in the way.
Liz
1040295_6_a
Yep!
It says so on the map.
Silica
1040295_5_a
So there's a material we need
at the bottom of this thing?
Liz
1040295_4_a
The competition pool. Everyone
here seems really serious...
Silica
1040295_3_a
Silica
1040295_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
So okay, this pool is...
Liz
1040295_1_a
Sinon
1040293_33_a
Oh yeah!
Leafa
1040293_32_a
Kirito
1040293_31_a
Ahahaha... Anyway, let's split up
and get material hunting.
Asuna
1040293_30_a
Leafa
1040293_29_a
You sure about that?
Sinon
1040293_28_a
Asuna
1040293_27_a
Oh, come on! I'm not that bad!!
Kirito
1040293_26_a
Leafa
1040293_25_a
A power gamer so obsessed you'd
do whatever it takes to get ahead?
Sinon
1040293_24_a
Asuna
1040293_23_a
Wh-What sort of person do you
think I am?! I'd never do that!!
Kirito
1040293_22_a
Sinon
1040293_21_a
Kirito! I know you want those
items, but I FORBID you from going
into the girls' dressing room!
Leafa
1040293_20_a
We need to go into the shower and
dressing rooms to get some of
these items!
Kirito
1040293_19_a
What's wrong, Kirito?
Asuna
1040293_18_a
Wait a sec... No way!
Kirito
1040293_17_a
Asuna
1040293_16_a
Ha ha, good point. Well, a lot of
businesses sponsored OS, so I
guess it's just the way it is...
Kirito
1040293_15_a
This feels underhanded.
Essentially, they're forcing us to
go to their shops and spend money.
Sinon
1040293_14_a
Leafa
1040293_13_a
We'll have to go to the souvenir
shops and cafes too, not just
the pools.
Sinon
1040293_12_a
That is a lot. We'll have to go
pretty much everywhere to
finish this quest.
Asuna
1040293_11_a
So this is the quest map?
Whoa... There's gathering
spots all over the place!
Kirito
1040293_9_a
Asuna
1040293_10_a
Sure. I'm in.
Sinon
1040293_8_a
She literally picked up Silica and
started dashing around to find
materials. So...want to help out?
Leafa
1040293_7_a
Sinon
1040293_6_a
Which is why Liz is getting so
fired up about this blacksmithy
quest thing.

Since they're strengthened by The
Order, they can't be customized
that much.
Asuna
1040293_4_a
Yeah. Usually, D-weapons just
automatically get stronger based
on your ranking.
Asuna
1040293_3_a
Asuna
1040293_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
Cool, a crafting quest? Collecting
materials and enhancing a
D-weapon sounds like fun.
Kirito
1040293_1_a
Thanks, that'd be great!
Liz
1040291_14_a
I'll go ask Kirito and everyone
to help too. I think I saw them
splashing around over thataway.
Leafa
1040291_13_a
Yeah, sure! We'd love to help!
Leafa
1040291_12_a
You know it!
But is that cool with everyone?
Liz
1040291_11_a
So, want to give it a try?
Silica
1040291_10_a
But if this place has a crafting
mini-game, I am ALL over that!
Liz
1040291_9_a
Now that's what I'm talking about!
OS doesn't have much in the way
of crafting, which is lame.
Liz
1040291_8_a
Oh, what about this one? You have
to collect crafting mats from lots
of pools and enhance a D-weapon.
Leafa
1040291_7_a
Yeah, but I want a quest designed
specifically for ME! Is that too
much to ask?!
Liz
1040291_6_a
and really tiny gathering quests
too. There's so much variety!
Silica
1040291_5_a
There really are! Big events,
like the one Asuna just did,
Silica
1040291_4_a
Leafa
1040291_3_a
Silica
1040291_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
Hmmmmmm...
There are officially a billion
different OS events here.
Liz
1040291_1_a
You can say that again!
Thanks for looking out
for us, guys.
Seven
1040288_51_a
Seven
1040288_50_a
Hehe, you're right.
Rain
1040288_49_a
Asuna
1040288_48_a
Now that you've finally got some
time to spend together, it'd be a
shame to spend it fighting.
Kirito
1040288_47_a
Ha ha, I'm just glad you two
are on good terms again.
Kirito
1040288_46_a
Kirito
1040288_45_a
Oh, nothing!
Asuna
1040288_44_a
Rain
1040288_43_a
Huh? What'd you say, Asuna?
Seven
1040288_42_a
Kirito
1040288_41_a
Ha ha, so you WERE worried
about your little sister a little!
Asuna
1040288_40_a
Seven
1040288_39_a
Excuse you! Who saved you, again?
Rain
1040288_38_a
Well, you made it. Barely...
Seven
1040288_37_a
Seven
1040288_36_a
Yeah.
B-By sheer coincidence...
Rain
1040288_35_a
Kirito
1040288_34_a
Ah, so you were close by.
Asuna
1040288_33_a
Seven
1040288_32_a
Once I saw what was happening,
I stepped in and took them all
out.
Rain
1040288_31_a
Seven
1040288_30_a
They rioted and started attacking
her instead.
Rain
1040288_29_a
Kirito
1040288_28_a
Okay...?
Asuna
1040288_27_a
Rain
1040288_26_a
but instead of fighting harder,
they all quit!
Seven
1040288_25_a
I threatened the players I'd
hired with reduced rewards,
Seven
1040288_24_a
I just couldn't beat her.
Seven
1040288_23_a
Seven
1040288_22_a
Ahhh, I see.
Rain
1040288_21_a
Kirito
1040288_20_a
I just...don't understand how you
managed to resolve things after
that huge fight...
Asuna
1040288_19_a
Rain
1040288_18_a
You two look pretty confused.
Seven
1040288_17_a
Seven
1040288_16_a
Is everything okay, guys?
Rain
1040288_15_a
Kirito
1040288_14_a
It's just...over? Like that?
After that massive fight?
Asuna
1040288_13_a
Asuna
1040288_12_a
Told you.
Kirito
1040288_11_a
No way! Wow...
Rain
1040288_9_a
Seven
1040288_10_a
They're way bigger than any of
the parks in Japan!
Seven
1040288_8_a
Well, if you really want to go
that badly, let's at least go to
an American theme park!
Seven
1040288_7_a
O-Oh...
Well, in that case, sure.
Hehe, sorry...
Seven
1040288_6_a
Are you not getting the part where
I said I want to go with YOU?
Rain
1040288_5_a
Why go to a theme park when we
can experience so much more in VR?
Seven
1040288_4_a
A theme park?
How old are you, again?
Seven
1040288_3_a
Seven
1040288_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Hey, Seven! Let's go to this
theme park next time we're free!
Rain
1040288_1_a
Exactly. I don't think we need to
worry about it.
Kirito
1040287_17_a
Ha ha! Come to think of it,
that's how a lot of fights with
my brother played out.
Asuna
1040287_16_a
Hell, sometimes they end before
your parents even notice.
Kirito
1040287_15_a
I think it'll all blow over soon,
anyway. Like all fights between
siblings.
Kirito
1040287_14_a
Seven sets up the goons,
and Rain knocks them all down.
Kirito
1040287_13_a
Well, no one ever said they were
subtle.
Kirito
1040287_12_a
Y-You think? All I can see are two
people at each other's throats...
Asuna
1040287_11_a
Granted, I don't think even
they realize that yet.
Kirito
1040287_10_a
This is just how they've decided
to play with each other after
spending so much time apart.
Kirito
1040287_9_a
What do you mean, messing around?
Asuna
1040287_8_a
They're just messing around
with each other.
Kirito
1040287_7_a
but then I talked to them, and it
all made sense.
Kirito
1040287_6_a
Yeah, I had that same "not again!"
feeling at first,
Kirito
1040287_5_a
Why do you sound so happy about
it? They're fighting again!
Asuna
1040287_4_a
Yeah. They're getting crazier and
crazier. Their audience seems to
be growing, too.
Kirito
1040287_3_a
Kirito
1040287_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Wow, they're really taking these
fights to the next level...
Asuna
1040287_1_a
What the
? Where are you going?
Rain
1040285_31_a
Later!
Kirito
1040285_30_a
Ha ha, let's just call it a hunch.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Kirito
1040285_29_a
How can you be so sure?
Rain
1040285_28_a
I think he'll sit this one out.
Kirito
1040285_27_a
He simply understands Seven better
than anyone else. And if he knows
what Seven's thinking,
Kirito
1040285_26_a
He'd do anything Seven said.
Rain
1040285_25_a
Really? What makes you say that?
Rain
1040285_24_a
I'm pretty sure he won't show.
Kirito
1040285_23_a
Ah, you mean Sumeragi.
Kirito
1040285_22_a
If she managed to recruit her
second-in-command for this fight,
it'll get a lot more interesting.
Rain
1040285_21_a
Shamrock wasn't stacked with
powerful players, but it had a
few.
Rain
1040285_20_a
She's got all her ex-Shamrock
goons on her side, right?
Rain
1040285_19_a
Not necessarily.
Rain
1040285_18_a
Which is precisely where you're
at the height of your powers.
Checkmate, right?
Kirito
1040285_17_a
Right. Surprise attacks won't work
on you, so she'll have to attack
you head-on.
Kirito
1040285_16_a
I've got one more ace in the hole
than she does, though.
Rain
1040285_15_a
But you're right. Seven was never
one to fight on the front lines.
Of course she'd hire goons.
Rain
1040285_14_a
Heh, to put it mildly!
Rain
1040285_13_a
It seems like you're holding your
own against these assassins.
Kirito
1040285_12_a
Meaning...?
Rain
1040285_11_a
That was my original plan, yeah.
But plans change.
Kirito
1040285_10_a
Ehh... Y'know...
Kirito
1040285_9_a
What are you doing here, Kirito?
Have you come to mediate our
little fight?
Rain
1040285_8_a
Rain
1040285_7_a
Heh, so you did see me.
Kirito
1040285_6_a
And don't think I haven't noticed
you, Mr. Dark-Haired Swordsman.
Rain
1040285_5_a
Clearly...I was wrong...
Player A
1040285_4_a
bg_18_mountain
Hah! You really thought you could
sneak up on me like that?
Rain
1040285_3_a
bg_black
AUGH!
Player A
1040285_2_a
bg_18_mountain
HYAH!
Rain
1040285_1_a
Player B
1040283_45_a
Player A
1040283_44_a
Get back here, Kirito! Tell me
what you meant by that!
Seven
1040283_43_a
See you around, Seven.
Kirito
1040283_42_a
I'll leave that to your
imagination.
Kirito
1040283_41_a
Player B
1040283_40_a
Player A
1040283_39_a
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
Seven
1040283_38_a
I'm glad I came to check on you.
I feel better.
Kirito
1040283_37_a
Hahaha, no thanks, I'm good.
Kirito
1040283_36_a
Player B
1040283_35_a
Player A
1040283_34_a
I'll even let you in on the reward
if we win!
Seven
1040283_33_a
Player B
1040283_32_a
Player A
1040283_31_a
Hehe, you can join my team of
assassins too, if you want.
Seven
1040283_30_a
I'd say you're selling yourself
short there, but you might have
a point...
Kirito
1040283_29_a
Player B
1040283_28_a
Player A
1040283_27_a
Naturally! No way could I beat
Rain in a duel!
Seven
1040283_26_a
You're enabling PKs for this
fight? AND you can recruit allies?
Kirito
1040283_25_a
Player B
1040283_24_a
Player A
1040283_23_a
The prize is making the loser wear
whatever outfit the winner wants!
Seven
1040283_22_a
Player B
1040283_21_a
Player A
1040283_20_a
Rules? There's only one rule!
The battle's over when one of
us gives up or gets killed!
Seven
1040283_19_a
So what are the rules for this
fight, anyway?
Kirito
1040283_18_a
Player B
1040283_17_a
Player A
1040283_16_a
Shamrock may have disbanded,
but you'd be surprised what people
will do for a reward!
Seven
1040283_15_a
And they're the fighters I've
trained for the battle ahead!
Seven
1040283_14_a
Player B
1040283_13_a
Player A
1040283_12_a
You've got a mind like a steel
trap, Kirito! Good eye!
Seven
1040283_11_a
Wait a minute... I've seen these
guys before! They're former
Shamrock members!
Kirito
1040283_10_a
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
What do you mean,
wipe her off the map?!
Kirito
1040283_9_a
Player A
1040283_8_a
Seven
1040283_7_a
For Seven!
Player B
1040283_6_a
For Seven!
Player A
1040283_5_a
This is the group of elite
assassins that'll wipe Rain
off the map!
Seven
1040283_4_a
Player B
1040283_3_a
Player A
1040283_2_a
bg_21_alne
Hehe. What do you think, Kirito?
Seven
1040283_1_a
Yeah, I guess so.
Kirito
1040281_19_a
Sisters are still separate people,
you know.
Asuna
1040281_18_a
Not only are they both picky, but
they're both control freaks when
it comes to fashion.
Asuna
1040281_17_a
Have you met them, Kirito?
Asuna
1040281_16_a
I mean, they both have their
preferences, but how'd THAT
turn into a huge fight?
Kirito
1040281_15_a
Ah, so they had to pick out
clothes for each other, huh?
Kirito
1040281_14_a
Now picture the two of them
trying to pick outfits for each
other. That's how it started.
Asuna
1040281_13_a
True. She did kind of stalk us
for a while once before.
Kirito
1040281_12_a
but Rain, as you can imagine,
doesn't like drawing attention
to herself.
Asuna
1040281_11_a
Well, Seven, being an idol, likes
to buy flashy, head-turning
outfits,
Asuna
1040281_10_a
So they're sisters who aren't
on the same page when it comes
to fashion? How's that possible?
Kirito
1040281_9_a
But it became apparent that their
sense of style differed, and...
Things escalated from there.
Asuna
1040281_8_a
Well, at first everything was
fine. They went to a bunch of
shops in search of new clothes.
Asuna
1040281_7_a
Oh no...
Kirito
1040281_6_a
They decided to go out and shop
together in the real world, and
Asuna
1040281_5_a
Man, they never quit.
What started it this time?
Kirito
1040281_4_a
No...
That's what I heard, at least.
Asuna
1040281_3_a
Asuna
1040281_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Seven and Rain fought again?!
Are you kidding?
Kirito
1040281_1_a
Siune
1040278_37_a
Thanks, guys!
Yuuki
1040278_36_a
Yeah, we're always happy to help!!
Asuna
1040278_35_a
Asuna
1040278_34_a
Yeah, that's the spirit!
We've got your back, Yuuki!
Kirito
1040278_33_a
Now it's up to me to use the
lessons I learned to make an
even better place next time!
Yuuki
1040278_32_a
Siune
1040278_31_a
Random inspiration or not, this
whole safari park was a great
learning experience for me.
Yuuki
1040278_30_a
Kirito
1040278_29_a
Kirito, seriously not the time for
your random factoids!
Asuna
1040278_28_a
Siune
1040278_27_a
Ugh... I know. I don't want
to know, but I know.
Yuuki
1040278_26_a
Hey, fun fact! If the climate goes
haywire and we die, cockroaches
are still guaranteed to survive!
Kirito
1040278_25_a
Yeah, I guess...
Yuuki
1040278_24_a
Asuna
1040278_23_a
So too much power can lead to your
own ruin... Humanity should keep
that in mind.
Kirito
1040278_22_a
but they couldn't cope with it.
Yuuki
1040278_21_a
Siune
1040278_20_a
I kinda feel bad for them. I tried
to make the environment as
realistic as possible,
Yuuki
1040278_19_a
Kirito
1040278_18_a
I...think I understand.
Asuna
1040278_17_a
In that sense, those animals might
have been too strong for their
own good.
Siune
1040278_16_a
Isn't strength or size, but the
ability to adapt to one's
environment.
Siune
1040278_15_a
Yuuki
1040278_14_a
I've heard this theory before too.
Essentially, the key factor to
long-term survival...
Siune
1040278_13_a
How can being too awesome be
a problem?
Asuna
1040278_12_a
There are some theories that they
died out because they were
too big and too strong.
Kirito
1040278_11_a
Those megafauna all went extinct
on Earth a long, long time ago.
Kirito
1040278_10_a
Actually, I did think it was a
possibility.
Kirito
1040278_9_a
Kirito
1040278_8_a
How could this happen?
Asuna
1040278_7_a
So pretty much all of them passed
away before we could fight them.
Yuuki
1040278_6_a
They didn't have enough food,
or they couldn't cope with
the climate...
Yuuki
1040278_5_a
Siune
1040278_4_a
I didn't believe it at first
either, but it looks like they
all died of different causes.
Yuuki
1040278_3_a
Asuna
1040278_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
You mean those monsters
I mean
megafauna
all just died off on
their own?
Kirito
1040278_1_a
Y-Yeah...
I guess that's the right move...
Yuuki
1040277_20_a
I know time is short, but I
recommend that we gather more help
and work out a detailed strategy.
Siune
1040277_19_a
Yuuki
1040277_18_a
Exactly. If it's just us, I doubt
we'll survive an encounter
without a plan of action.
Siune
1040277_17_a
Ha ha, for sure. These guys are
the stuff of nightmares. They make
horror movies about 'em.
Kirito
1040277_16_a
Yeah... I wouldn't want to run
into any of these monstrosities
in a dark alley...
Asuna
1040277_15_a
Asuna
1040277_14_a
I have to point out that our
targets aren't just big
they're gargantuan.
Kirito
1040277_13_a
Yeah, I guess...
Yuuki
1040277_12_a
I suppose it's just too difficult
for different time periods to
coexist in the animal kingdom...
Siune
1040277_11_a
And I worked so hard on it too...
Yuuki
1040277_10_a
Siune
1040277_9_a
It has... Those giant beasties
are doing a great job of tearing
up my safari park.
Yuuki
1040277_8_a
Asuna
1040277_7_a
So it has come to this...
Kirito
1040277_6_a
Your quest is to hunt down and
kill those monsters
er, animals.
Yuuki
1040277_5_a
And Titanoboa cerrejonensis:
a snake roughly 45-feet long...
Yuuki
1040277_4_a
Megalodon:
a shark way over 40-feet long...
Yuuki
1040277_3_a
Siune
1040277_2_a
bg_02_forest
Sarcosuchus:
a 30-foot long crocodile...
Yuuki
1040277_1_a
...
Kirito
1040275_25_a
I think the other animals around
here might just die from sheer
terror.
Asuna
1040275_24_a
Kirito
1040275_23_a
I hope it's enough... With
giant, scary-looking beasts
like them lurking about,
Asuna
1040275_22_a
but honestly, I don't know what
they'll do. I'm keeping a close
eye on them just in case.
Yuuki
1040275_21_a
Siune
1040275_20_a
Yeah. I was worried about that
too, so I took precautions.
I tweaked their behavior patterns,
Yuuki
1040275_19_a
the other mammals are as good as
lunch... The food chain's going to
break here for sure...
Asuna
1040275_18_a
Yuuki, are you sure this is a
good idea? With all these big
meat-eaters around,
Asuna
1040275_17_a
Kirito
1040275_16_a
Look at all those giant
carnivores...
Asuna
1040275_15_a
most immediately think of the
dinosaurs. But all these creatures
walked the earth once too.
Siune
1040275_14_a
Yuuki
1040275_13_a
If it's any consolation, I hadn't
heard of them either. When people
think of extinct animals,
Siune
1040275_12_a
So things like that really
existed? Weird...
Asuna
1040275_11_a
So I spent a few sleepless nights
researching animals I could see
you getting excited about.
Kirito
1040275_10_a
Asuna
1040275_9_a
Ha ha, not exactly. I just had a
hunch that these were the sorts
of things you were going to add.
Kirito
1040275_8_a
I never imagined you were an
expert on extinct mammals...
Yuuki
1040275_7_a
Siune
1040275_6_a
K-Kirito...
I'm... I'm beyond words...
You got them all right...
Yuuki
1040275_5_a
And that wolf with the freaky
silhouette is an Andrewsarchus!
Kirito
1040275_4_a
That uber gorilla standing on
that rock's a Gigantopithecus...
Kirito
1040275_3_a
Asuna
1040275_2_a
bg_08_forest
That big one's a Megatherium,
and that saber-toothed tiger thing
over there is a Smilodon...
Kirito
1040275_1_a
Care to fill me in...?
Asuna
1040273_20_a
Ahh, so that's it.
I think I know what she's up to.
Kirito
1040273_19_a
Hmm...
So something from the real
world that shouldn't exist...
Kirito
1040273_18_a
Yeah...
Kirito
1040273_17_a
That's why she went out of her
way to design a park around
actual animals.
Asuna
1040273_16_a
who don't have many opportunities
to get out in the real world, to
be able to see real animals.
Asuna
1040273_15_a
That's a good point. Her original
idea was to provide a way for
people like her,
Asuna
1040273_14_a
If that's her whole concept,
I can't see her just adding
monsters to the mix now...
Kirito
1040273_13_a
where ALO players could have a
chance to see real-world animals,
right?
Kirito
1040273_12_a
She also talked a lot about how
she wanted her park to be a fun
place,
Kirito
1040273_11_a
But remember? We already had
problems with ALO monsters trying
to snack on her exhibits.
Kirito
1040273_10_a
That's what I thought at first...
Kirito
1040273_9_a
Do you think she's going to try
to create her own original
monsters?
Asuna
1040273_8_a
She said "animals that shouldn't
exist."
Asuna
1040273_7_a
Yeah...
Kirito
1040273_6_a
You're still thinking about what
she said the other day, huh?
Asuna
1040273_5_a
What sort of animals do you think
Yuuki's going to add to her safari
park next?
Kirito
1040273_4_a
Yeah, Kirito? What is it?
Asuna
1040273_3_a
Asuna
1040273_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Hey, Asuna.
Kirito
1040273_1_a
If I had to give you a hint,
I'd say animals that shouldn't
exist! I think!
Yuuki
1040271_26_a
Siune
1040271_25_a
Hehehe...
That's a secret!
Yuuki
1040271_24_a
Asuna
1040271_23_a
Really? What other animals can
you even add at this point?
Kirito
1040271_22_a
Nah, they're fine. Besides, I'm
planning on adding a ton more!
Yuuki
1040271_21_a
The animals look like they need
more room to roam free...
Siune
1040271_20_a
But isn't it time to expand the
park? Things are getting a bit
crowded in here.
Siune
1040271_19_a
Apparently I didn't completely
wipe the old data. I'm slowly
patching all those bugs, though.
Yuuki
1040271_18_a
Siune
1040271_17_a
Ahaha, yeah. I borrowed this
flying dragon's movement when
I programmed that guy.
Yuuki
1040271_16_a
Asuna
1040271_15_a
Ha ha, that's good to hear.
Last time I stopped by, the pond
alligator was flying around.
Kirito
1040271_14_a
I think after all my research and
work, they're finally starting to
move like the real things.
Yuuki
1040271_13_a
Siune
1040271_12_a
Yup, that's right! I also wanted
to improve the animal animations
I used, too.
Yuuki
1040271_11_a
You wanted to get a closer look
at all the animals so you could
create more?
Asuna
1040271_10_a
Kirito
1040271_9_a
Wait, so that's why you asked me
to bring your probe to a zoo the
other day?
Asuna
1040271_8_a
Hehehe! What do you think?
Awesome, right?!
Yuuki
1040271_7_a
Yuuki
1040271_6_a
Yuuki got very excited and
started drawing animal after
animal.
Siune
1040271_5_a
Look at that. There are so many
more different animals now...
Kirito
1040271_4_a
Hey, it looks like the safari park
Yuuki made during that quest
contest has been upgraded.
Asuna
1040271_3_a
Asuna
1040271_2_a
bg_02_forest
Whoa...
Kirito
1040271_1_a
Aw yeah!
Kirito
1040268_22_a
Thanks! Woohoo, here we go!!
Yuuki
1040268_21_a
Alright, you're on!
Let's do this thing!
Kirito
1040268_20_a
Yeah, it's supposed to be good!
Super-difficult, though...
Kirito
1040268_19_a
I figured you'd be a good partner
for it.
Yuuki
1040268_18_a
But check this out, Kirito!
Did you see this quest yet?
Yuuki
1040268_17_a
Uh, n-no!
Nothing at all, hehe!
Yuuki
1040268_16_a
Did you say something?
Kirito
1040268_15_a
Yeah...
Maybe...one day...
Yuuki
1040268_14_a
Just like us humans
in the real world, huh?
Kirito
1040268_13_a
I get it, though. Even burly
Dwarfs want their wedding day
to be special and beautiful...
Kirito
1040268_12_a
I'm plenty girly as it is!
Yuuki
1040268_11_a
Hey! Whaddya mean by that!
Yuuki
1040268_10_a
So you do care about some
girly things after all, huh?
Kirito
1040268_9_a
It's just...I was thinking
about that Dwarf wedding.
Yuuki
1040268_8_a
Hm? Something on your mind?
Kirito
1040268_7_a
Yeah... 
sigh
...
Yuuki
1040268_6_a
Sounds like that turned out well!
Kirito
1040268_5_a
Everyone else gave up eventually,
and they canceled the quest.
Yuuki
1040268_4_a
Looks like in the end we were
the only ones who found 'em!
Yuuki
1040268_3_a
Yuuki
1040268_2_a
bg_21_alne
So how did things turn out with
the Dwarf quest?
Kirito
1040268_1_a
Whoa, really? Thanks! Guess we'll
take you up on that offer!
Yuuki
1040267_26_a
How 'bout ye sit tight and watch
the celebration, then? Our thanks
to ye both.
Dwarf
1040267_25_a
Ye swear it on your soul?
Ah, many thanks!
Dwarf
1040267_24_a
We won't tell a soul! You guys
just enjoy your wedding day,
alright?
Yuuki
1040267_23_a
Of course! This was my plan
all along, y'know!
Yuuki
1040267_22_a
It goes right against the
objective of your race....
Kirito
1040267_21_a
Are you sure this is okay, Yuuki?
Kirito
1040267_20_a
Yep! You got it!
Yuuki
1040267_19_a
Fairy folk, only one thing do
we ask of ye. Cannae ye just
let us be?
Dwarf
1040267_18_a
We Dwarven folk live outside
the ken of yer bright sun...
Dwarf
1040267_17_a
I see... I guess it is nice to have
a wedding when the sun is shining.
Kirito
1040267_16_a
Whene'er a Dwarven lass and laddie
join in marriage, we hold 'em a
bonnie party up top.
Dwarf
1040267_15_a
Whoa, you're right...
Kirito
1040267_14_a
They're dressed up super fancy!
Yuuki
1040267_13_a
Psst, Kirito! Check that
Dwarf couple out!
Yuuki
1040267_12_a
You've got a wedding?
Kirito
1040267_11_a
More's the pity. We only come
up top to get the sunshine
on our wedding days...
Dwarf
1040267_10_a
Ach, so we cannae go to the
top-lands this day, then...
Dwarf
1040267_9_a
So, ye surface-folk came
to warn us of danger?
Dwarf
1040267_8_a
We didn't come here to fight.
We came to warn you about
a danger from the surface.
Kirito
1040267_7_a
Oh, right...
Yuuki
1040267_6_a
They're NPCs, Yuuki. Better
break things down simply so
they'll understand.
Kirito
1040267_5_a
N-No, you got it all wrong!
We're here to protect you!
Yuuki
1040267_4_a
Kirito
1040267_3_a
Yuuki
1040267_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Dare ye raise yer swords
against the Dwarven folk
of the deep earth?
Dwarf
1040267_1_a
Thank goodness...
Kirito
1040265_28_a
We can understand ye, y'know!
Dwarf
1040265_27_a
Yeah, but-
Yuuki
1040265_26_a
Geez, Yuuki. You call that a
first impression?
Kirito
1040265_25_a
H-Hello! Us, friend! Good? Yes?
Yuuki
1040265_24_a
Okay...
Here goes!
Yuuki
1040265_23_a
Oh, yeah...
That's right.
Kirito
1040265_22_a
They don't trust other races yet,
so we gotta show we're not
gonna hurt 'em!
Yuuki
1040265_21_a
H-Hey, Kirito!
Not so fast, okay!
Yuuki
1040265_20_a
murmur
murmur
Dwarfs
1040265_19_a
Yuuki
1040265_18_a
Whoaaa... No mistaking it from
this close! Those are Dwarfs,
alright!
Kirito
1040265_17_a
Yeah!
Kirito
1040265_16_a
Let's go!
Yuuki
1040265_15_a
Y-Yeah!
Those have gotta be Dwarfs!
Yuuki
1040265_14_a
Whoa, you're right! They're
bigger than Pixies, but they sure
are small... Could those be...?!
Kirito
1040265_13_a
There are some pudgy little
fairies!
Yuuki
1040265_12_a
Look, over there! In between
those two big trees!
Yuuki
1040265_11_a
What is it?
Kirito
1040265_10_a
Ah!
Yuuki
1040265_9_a
I guess you're right.
Yuuki
1040265_8_a
this was only ever a
player-organized quest.
Kirito
1040265_7_a
That'd be weird if it was an
official event, but then again,
Kirito
1040265_6_a
Hmmm... Maybe it was just
a rumor after all.
Kirito
1040265_5_a
That just leaves the plateaus
and high grounds.
Yuuki
1040265_4_a
Yeah... We must've searched out
every cave, cavern, and grotto in
the whole territory.
Yuuki
1040265_3_a
Yuuki
1040265_2_a
bg_18_mountain
It doesn't look like there are
any caves around here...
Kirito
1040265_1_a
Yeah! Let's go find those
Dwarfs before anyone else!
Kirito
1040263_26_a
You'd do that? Yay!
Yuuki
1040263_25_a
I'm on board with that! I can't
join the race-specific quest,
but I could help you out.
Kirito
1040263_24_a
I-It's no big deal...
Yuuki
1040263_23_a
Ha ha! That's pretty
kind of you, Yuuki.
Kirito
1040263_22_a
If I find them first, I can warn
them about the other Imps
that are looking for them.
Yuuki
1040263_21_a
Even if they're NPCs, I still
feel sorry for them.
Yuuki
1040263_20_a
Everyone's searching for
them, but the Dwarfs just
wanna be left alone.
Yuuki
1040263_19_a
Eh... It's not so much that.
Yuuki
1040263_18_a
Wow, Yuuki! For someone who
never plays race-specific quests,
you're really getting into this.
Kirito
1040263_17_a
So I thought to myself, "What are
the kinds of places they would go?"
Yuuki
1040263_16_a
That's the idea! I've seen them
looking like that in movies too.
Kirito
1040263_15_a
with big bushy beards who mine
gems and stuff underground.
Yuuki
1040263_14_a
Hmm... I guess when I think of
dwarfs, I think of short burly
dudes
Yuuki
1040263_13_a
Nothing to do with ALO, though.
Kirito
1040263_12_a
Oh, just generic enemies. But they
were based on a kind of fairy.
Kirito
1040263_11_a
Huh? What's that?
Yuuki
1040263_10_a
That reminds me of the Dark Dwarf
Miners back in SAO...
Kirito
1040263_9_a
huh, I also heard about finding a race of Dwarfs quest.
Kirito
1040263_8_a
You're not wrong, but think lower.
There's supposed to be a race of
Dwarfs living underground.
Yuuki
1040263_7_a
When I think of "Imps," I usually
think of "rocky mountaintops."
Kirito
1040263_6_a
Yep, that's the idea! I wanted
to get a sense of the terrain
around here.
Yuuki
1040263_5_a
What are you doing out here?
Looking for something?
Kirito
1040263_4_a
Oh, Kirito.
Yuuki
1040263_3_a
Hey, Yuuki.
Kirito
1040263_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Hmm...
Yuuki
1040263_1_a
Hehe, I guess you have a point...
Okay, I'll think about it!
Yuuki
1040261_17_a
Aww, c'mon! Where's your sense
of adventure? The game's set up
for us to go find 'em!
Imp
1040261_16_a
And even if there is a race in
hiding, it'd probably be better
to just leave them in peace.
Yuuki
1040261_15_a
I dunno about that... I don't join
the race-wide quests that often.
Yuuki
1040261_14_a
I bet they could use a famous
sword-master like you, Zekken!
Imp
1040261_13_a
Ooo, neat... Thanks for keeping
me in the loop!
Yuuki
1040261_12_a
So they've started up a new
race-wide quest to try to
find those Dwarfs.
Imp
1040261_11_a
Interesting...
Yuuki
1040261_10_a
But it seems there's been an
uptick in sightings lately.
Imp
1040261_9_a
Oh well... Whatever. I guess a lot
of players thought it was just an
urban myth, after all.
Imp
1040261_8_a
Hehe, sorry!
Not really my area of expertise.
Yuuki
1040261_7_a
And you've heard the theory
that they live under the Imp
territory, right?
Imp
1040261_6_a
Yeah. So in that sense, they're
not too different from us Imps.
Imp
1040261_5_a
"Dwarfs," huh? Like the ones in
mythology that live underground?
Yuuki
1040261_4_a
They told us about the discovery
of a legendary fairy race called
"Dwarfs."
Imp
1040261_3_a
Yuuki
1040261_2_a
bg_event_field
They held a race-wide information
session for us Imps today.
Imp
1040261_1_a
Yeah! Rare ores await!
Silica
1040258_25_a
So, now that those losers are
out of the way, let's get back
to mining!
Lisbeth
1040258_24_a
No one got stabbed! That counts
as "peaceful" in my book!
Lisbeth
1040258_23_a
Ahaha... I'm not sure that was
100% peaceful, but I'll take it.
Silica
1040258_22_a
Still, a peaceful solution is the
best solution, right?
Lisbeth
1040258_21_a
I bet Leafa and Sakuya would
forgive us even if we did smash
their faces in.
Lisbeth
1040258_20_a
Hehe, sorry to keep you on the
edge of your seat. But seriously.
With how rude those guys were,
Lisbeth
1040258_19_a
Well, I'm glad it worked...
All these scares are bad for
my nerves...
Silica
1040258_18_a
Yup. Though that part about making
it by accident was true. Still,
pathetically easy to trick them.
Lisbeth
1040258_17_a
So that was a debuff item
all along?
Silica
1040258_16_a
Welp, we dodged a bullet there.
I'm just glad we didn't have to
kick their butts.
Lisbeth
1040258_15_a
L-Liz...
Silica
1040258_14_a
...
Silica
1040258_13_a
GrrrAAAGH!! F-Fine!
But we'll get you for this!!
Sylph Player B
1040258_12_a
But even you must be smart enough
to realize that you can't beat us
with those debuffs.
Lisbeth
1040258_11_a
I mean, we could still fight
if you want. Your call.
Lisbeth
1040258_10_a
Grrr!
Sylph Player B
1040258_9_a
I just wanted to avoid having to
kick your teeth in.
Lisbeth
1040258_8_a
You're the ones who tried to start
a stupid fight with us.
Lisbeth
1040258_7_a
Y-You little
! You played us!
Sylph Player B
1040258_6_a
Umm...huh?
Silica
1040258_5_a
My oh my. How terrible.
Lisbeth
1040258_4_a
Wh-What the hell is this?!
All my stats got cut in half!!
Sylph Player B
1040258_3_a
Silica
1040258_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
So, how is it?
Lisbeth
1040258_1_a
Oh?
Silica
1040257_28_a
Oh... OOOH!!
Sylph Player B
1040257_27_a
So I just drink this, and...
Sylph Player B
1040257_26_a
R-Right...
Sylph Player B
1040257_25_a
Just go and try it already.
I'm a busy lady.
Lisbeth
1040257_24_a
O-Oh... Yeah. Forgot about that.
Sylph Player B
1040257_23_a
Do that and you don't get that
rare item I promised, do you?
Lisbeth
1040257_22_a
What's to stop us from using it to
give you two an epic beatdown?
Sylph Player B
1040257_21_a
Heh, fine. We'll try your item!
But if it really buffs us up...
Sylph Player B
1040257_20_a
But...
Silica
1040257_19_a
I've got no choice, right? This is
a business negotiation now. Gotta
please the potential customer!
Lisbeth
1040257_18_a
Liz, are you sure you want to
be so generous? These guys are
trying to kill us...
Silica
1040257_17_a
If you're happy with it, I'll give
you a freshly-crafted new one.
Blacksmith's honor.
Lisbeth
1040257_16_a
Ahaha, no way! Not me!
But if you insist, here.
Try this. It's a free sample.
Lisbeth
1040257_15_a
You're not trying to trick us,
right?
Sylph Player B
1040257_14_a
Dude...really?
Sylph Player B
1040257_13_a
Use it, and you'll get a
super-duper buff exponentially
better than regular ol' buffs.
Lisbeth
1040257_12_a
Ta-dah. This. I made it completely
by accident when I was doing some
smithing experimentation.
Lisbeth
1040257_11_a
A rare item?
What kind of rare item?
Sylph Player B
1040257_10_a
L-Liz, are you sure...?
Silica
1040257_9_a
I'll give you a super-rare item.
In return, you leave us alone.
Lisbeth
1040257_8_a
Then how about a deal? I promise
it'll be worth more than anything
you get for taking us out.
Lisbeth
1040257_7_a
Well...yeah.
Sylph Player B
1040257_6_a
You guys are achievement hunting,
right? That's why you're going
after other players?
Lisbeth
1040257_5_a
Silica
1040257_4_a
Huh?
Sylph Player B
1040257_3_a
Silica
1040257_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
TIME OUT!!
Lisbeth
1040257_1_a
H-Here they come!
Silica
1040255_19_a
No more talking!
Get 'em, boys!
Sylph Player B
1040255_18_a
Ahaha... Whoops.
What to do, what to do...?
Lisbeth
1040255_17_a
L-Liz!
Why are you making him angrier?!
Silica
1040255_16_a
Oh you cheeky little
Sylph Player B
1040255_15_a
Well, yeah. Easily...
Lisbeth
1040255_14_a
Hold on...
You're just dismissin' us, aren't
ya?! You think you can take us?!
Sylph Player B
1040255_13_a
What the hell are you two
whispering about?!
Sylph Player B
1040255_12_a
I guess so...
Silica
1040255_11_a
If we fought and killed Sylphs in
Sylph territory, it'd be an insult
to both of them.
Lisbeth
1040255_10_a
We can't do that. Sakuya issued us
this writ herself, and we asked
Leafa to speak on our behalf.
Lisbeth
1040255_9_a
Do we have no choice but to fight?
Silica
1040255_8_a
sigh
This is trouble I don't need...
Lisbeth
1040255_7_a
I guess we ran into renegades,
huh, Liz...?
Silica
1040255_6_a
This game's all about PvPing
other races, and I'm just itchin'
to slice up two outsiders!
Sylph Player B
1040255_5_a
A lord's promises are just a load
of bull! They can't do anything!
They mean nothing!
Sylph Player B
1040255_4_a
Oh really? Sorry to burst your
bubble, but I don't give a damn.
Sylph Player B
1040255_3_a
Silica
1040255_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
This writ comes from the lord of
the Sylphs: Sakuya herself!
Lisbeth
1040255_1_a
Umm... I think we ran into
some bad apples...
Silica
1040253_33_a
Who the hell cares?!
Sylph Player B
1040253_32_a
We have a writ of passage!
Lisbeth
1040253_31_a
Well, lookit what we got here.
Two little outsider girls
wanderin' into Sylph territory!
Sylph Player B
1040253_30_a
Silica
1040253_29_a
Who's there?!
Lisbeth
1040253_28_a
Heh heh heh...
???
1040253_27_a
Yeah...
Silica
1040253_26_a
If we met a Sylph renegade with
an axe to grind, they'd be extra
likely to attack us...
Lisbeth
1040253_25_a
from being renegade-y.
They're still technically a member
of their avatar's race.
Lisbeth
1040253_24_a
Another good point.
"Renegade" is just a derogatory
term made up to discourage people
Lisbeth
1040253_23_a
Yeah, and any renegade players
would be extra likely to attack
us...
Silica
1040253_22_a
some people might just attack
us anyway.
Lisbeth
1040253_21_a
But if there's no system-side way
to stop players from assaulting
those of other races,
Lisbeth
1040253_20_a
Good point... I'm sure Sakuya
would punish anyone who ignored
her writ...
Lisbeth
1040253_19_a
The writ Sakuya gave us doesn't
have any special game powers to
stop them...
Silica
1040253_18_a
But what if there are people
who will ignore it and attack us
anyway?
Silica
1040253_17_a
Well, that person just now was
willing to listen to reason.
Silica
1040253_16_a
We got the writ.
What's the problem?
Lisbeth
1040253_15_a
Yeah...
But I'm still pretty worried...
Silica
1040253_14_a
Yeah, same. But I get it. It's
only natural that people here
would think we were invading.
Lisbeth
1040253_13_a
Phew... I got really nervous
there for a second!
Silica
1040253_12_a
...
Silica
1040253_11_a
Ah, okay. Then you're good.
Sorry for yelling at you.
Sylph Player A
1040253_10_a
Yup. Sakuya gave us special
permission to mine out here.
Lisbeth
1040253_9_a
Hmm?
Oh...
Whoa! This is Sakuya's seal!
Sylph Player A
1040253_8_a
No! We come in peace!
Look, see?
Lisbeth
1040253_7_a
What the hell?!
You guys invading us?!
Sylph Player A
1040253_6_a
A Leprechaun and a Cait Sith?!
Sylph Player A
1040253_5_a
Huh?
Lisbeth
1040253_4_a
Huh? Who the hell are you guys?
???
1040253_3_a
Silica
1040253_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Right, this looks like the mining
area.
Lisbeth
1040253_1_a
Heh. Alright, here's my
schedule...
Lisbeth
1040251_16_a
I'm glad to hear that.
When do you plan on going?
Silica
1040251_15_a
But thanks to that handy-dandy
writ, I'm safe from assault.
Lisbeth
1040251_14_a
Yeah. If I just went in without
permission, I could be attacked
at any moment.
Lisbeth
1040251_13_a
Oh wow! That's great!
Silica
1040251_12_a
She asked Sakuya, who made up a
writ of safe passage for me.
Lisbeth
1040251_11_a
Ah, so that's why you look so
worried. Relax! I asked Leafa
to get me a pass.
Lisbeth
1040251_10_a
That area isn't a neutral zone
anymore...
Silica
1040251_9_a
Is it really okay for a bunch of
non-Sylph players to wander
around Sylph territory?
Silica
1040251_8_a
Um...yeah!
Well, I'd really like to, but...
Silica
1040251_7_a
I was planning to, but...
Wanna come, Silica?
Lisbeth
1040251_6_a
Wow! That sounds like fun!
But you're going solo, right?
Silica
1040251_5_a
You bet. I heard we can
pick up a special ore out
there right now.
Lisbeth
1040251_4_a
Are you really going to the river
in Sylph territory that we went
to with everyone?
Silica
1040251_3_a
Lisbeth
1040251_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Liz! Hey Liz!
Silica
1040251_1_a
Hahaha.
Kirito
1040248_46_a
Streaaa!
I will NOT be pleased if it does!
Yui
1040248_45_a
And I hope some more hilarity
happens while we're at it, too!
Strea
1040248_44_a
O-Okay! Sure!
Yui
1040248_43_a
So stick with me, Yui!
We can do it!
Strea
1040248_42_a
Strea...
Yui
1040248_41_a
I'll keep searching for a way to
get that uniform to stay the right
size. And I'll find it, promise!
Strea
1040248_40_a
You...haven't?
Yui
1040248_39_a
Well, that was a hilarious failure,
but I haven't given up yet, Yui!
Strea
1040248_38_a
I did NOT find it funny!!
Yui
1040248_37_a
Ahaha, we were! In danger of
laughing too hard!
Strea
1040248_36_a
I was worried for a sec that you
two were in danger.
Kirito
1040248_35_a
Ha ha... Sounds like it was
a sight to see.
Kirito
1040248_34_a
I'm not some kind of magician
performing for your pleasure,
Strea!
Yui
1040248_33_a
It was like watching some sort of
quick clothing change magic show!
Strea
1040248_32_a
I can't help it! You were standing
there with your mouth open while
your clothes were going crazy!
Strea
1040248_31_a
Strea!
Yui
1040248_30_a
Yeah... 
snrk
! Just thinking
about it's gonna make me...
Ahahahaha!
Strea
1040248_29_a
Then it shrunk, and seconds later
it grew again. It kept doing that,
over and over and over...
Yui
1040248_28_a
But then it got all big and floppy
again.
Strea
1040248_27_a
Well, it worked, kinda.
The uniform fit perfectly
for a second.
Strea
1040248_26_a
Umm... Can someone tell me what
happened?
Kirito
1040248_25_a
That was just TOO hilarious!
I was rolling on the floor
in there!
Strea
1040248_24_a
Kirito
1040248_23_a
Strea
1040248_22_a
sigh
...
Yui
1040248_21_a
Kirito
1040248_20_a
S-Strea! Stop laughing already and
DO SOMETHING!!
Yui
1040248_19_a
AHAHAHAHAHA!!
Strea
1040248_18_a
Girls?! What's happening?!
Kirito
1040248_17_a
Ahhh!
Wh-What's going on here?!
Yui
1040248_16_a
Aha...
AHAHAHA!
Strea
1040248_15_a
Huh?
Kirito
1040248_14_a
Wh-What's happening?!
Yui
1040248_13_a
Hmm? What's this?
Strea
1040248_12_a
Yay! We did it! We did
huh?!
Yui
1040248_11_a
That's good to hear!
Kirito
1040248_10_a
You did it! It's the perfect size!
Yui
1040248_9_a
Wow!
Strea
1040248_8_a
U-Um... Did it work?
Kirito
1040248_7_a
...
Yui
1040248_6_a
...
Strea
1040248_5_a
...
Kirito
1040248_4_a
O-Okay! Good luck!
Yui
1040248_3_a
Kirito
1040248_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Here goes, Yui!
I'm going to magic it up!
Strea
1040248_1_a
Sure! Thanks, Liz!
Strea
1040247_28_a
Just...be careful with it, okay?
I warned you.
Liz
1040247_27_a
Nope.
Well...
Liz
1040247_26_a
You don't have to be a Leprechaun
to learn it?
Strea
1040247_25_a
R-Right... Well, if you insist,
I'll teach you how to learn the
spell.
Liz
1040247_24_a
But who cares! This is for Yui!
I'm willing to give it a shot!
Strea
1040247_23_a
Hmm, I see...
Strea
1040247_22_a
There's all sorts of restrictions
in place to prevent it from being
overpowered, too.
Liz
1040247_21_a
Anything can happen when you mess
with powerful magic. It bends all
sorts of rules.
Liz
1040247_20_a
Spells with unique special effects
like that one come chock full of
weird side effects.
Liz
1040247_19_a
Huh? But why?
Strea
1040247_18_a
but it's a bad idea.
It's too risky.
Liz
1040247_17_a
Hmm... Actually, forget it. I know
I was the one who brought it up,
Liz
1040247_16_a
Is it safe to use them both
together?
Strea
1040247_15_a
Maybe. There's a spell that can
extend another spell's duration...
Liz
1040247_14_a
You have something that can help?
Strea
1040247_13_a
Hmm... Oh yeah! If I use that
spell too, it might just solve
our problem.
Liz
1040247_12_a
So the sailor uniform will go back
to its original size.
Liz
1040247_11_a
Oh...
Strea
1040247_10_a
There's one little hiccup though.
Like a lot of spells, this one
will wear off eventually.
Liz
1040247_9_a
Cool!
Strea
1040247_8_a
It was originally made to shrink
giant unique weapons and stuff
that were too big to use.
Liz
1040247_7_a
Wow! That sounds really useful!
Strea
1040247_6_a
Just a little magic to adjust the
size of equipment. I can shrink
that sailor uniform down with it.
Liz
1040247_5_a
What kinda spell?!
Tell me, tell me!
Strea
1040247_4_a
What?!
Seriously?!
Strea
1040247_3_a
Strea
1040247_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Yeah, I got just the spell.
Leprechauns were made to
solve this kind of problem.
Liz
1040247_1_a
Yeah, thank you, Daddy!
Yui
1040245_23_a
Thanks for the suggestion, Kirito!
Strea
1040245_22_a
Yay! Hope is still alive!
Let's go see her!
Strea
1040245_21_a
Yes, you're probably right...
Yui
1040245_20_a
Maybe she'll have something up her
sleeve that can help.
Kirito
1040245_19_a
including tons that have nothing
to do with combat.
Kirito
1040245_18_a
They also have a lot of unique
item-related spells,
Kirito
1040245_17_a
Yeah. Leprechauns are crafting
masters, right?
Kirito
1040245_16_a
Liz?
Yui
1040245_15_a
I'm not sure she can help,
but why not ask Liz for advice?
Kirito
1040245_14_a
Wait...
Kirito
1040245_13_a
Yeah, it is a shame...
Kirito
1040245_12_a
But you worked so hard making it
for me...
Yui
1040245_11_a
Well, that ended poorly.
I guess we'll have to give up.
Strea
1040245_10_a
It's so baggy I can't even move...
Yui
1040245_9_a
There are child-size outfits for
NPCs, but the selection's pretty
limited.
Kirito
1040245_8_a
Hmm... I guess most VRMMOs assume
that their players are at least
teenagers.
Kirito
1040245_7_a
but it looks like even that's huge
on you!
Strea
1040245_6_a
Sorry, Yui! I tried making the
smallest size I could,
Strea
1040245_5_a
Daddy, now you're laughing at me
too?! How mean!
Yui
1040245_4_a
Strea
1040245_3_a
Yui
1040245_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
snicker
Hahaha!
Yui, sorry, but it's too funny.
Kirito
1040245_1_a
What's all the fuss ab
Kirito
1040243_23_a
AHAHAHAHAHA!!
Strea
1040243_22_a
Wh-What in the world is this
thing?!
Yui
1040243_21_a
Why's she laughing...?
Kirito
1040243_20_a
Let's see... Ah!
Ahahahahaha!!
Strea

Kirito

Ta-dah! How does it look?
Yui

...
Yui
1040243_17_a
I'll...just go wait outside...
Kirito
1040243_16_a
Erk! N-No, you got it all wrong!
I didn't mean to... Err...
Kirito
1040243_15_a
Kirito, you pervert! Only the
perviest pervs would want to watch
their own daughter change!
Strea
1040243_14_a
Ahem...
I'm going to change.
My clothes. Here.
Yui
1040243_13_a
Umm... Girls? Why are you staring
at me like that?
Kirito
1040243_12_a
...
Strea
1040243_11_a
...
Yui
1040243_10_a
Ahh, Daddy is happy his little
girl's happy...
Kirito
1040243_9_a
Of course!
Strea
1040243_8_a
Thank you very much, Strea!
May I try it on now?
Yui
1040243_7_a
Yup yup yup! I went into a sewing
frenzy to get it finished!
Strea
1040243_6_a
You finished what? Oh yeah!
That sailor uniform for Yui?
Kirito
1040243_5_a
Strea!
Yui

bg_11_home_lounge
Yui! I'm finished!
Strea
1040243_1_a
Hahaha, it's nice having a sister
that loves you, huh, Yui?
Kirito
1040241_23_a
O-Okay!
Thank you, Strea!
Yui
1040241_22_a
But leave it to me! I'll make
a super adorable sailor uniform
just for you!
Strea
1040241_21_a
I don't think you really fit the
sailor uniform image.
Strea
1040241_20_a
Hehe. But actually... No offense,
Yui, but your human form is still
kinda tiny.
Strea
1040241_19_a
Ha ha, don't forget to make her
a nice one, now!
Kirito
1040241_18_a
Come on, of course I'm sure!
You're like a big sister to me!
I gotta dress you up!
Strea
1040241_17_a
Are you sure?
It's a lot of work...
Yui
1040241_16_a
Oh yeah! I haven't made one for
Yui yet either. Hmm... Sure, I'd
love to!
Strea
1040241_15_a
Huh?
Yui
1040241_14_a
U-Uh, oh yeah! Strea, can you make
a sailor uniform for Yui?
Kirito
1040241_13_a
Heh heh heh!
Yui
1040241_12_a
G-Gah! Yui! No more encouraging
Strea!
Kirito
1040241_11_a
Yeah, totally! That avatar is
super cute!
Strea
1040241_10_a
But, Daddy, I bet your GGO avatar
would look great in a sailor
uniform!
Yui
1040241_9_a
You got to be kidding me...
Kirito
1040241_8_a
Oh yeah! I almost forgot to make
one for you too, Kirito!
Strea
1040241_7_a
I know I can't stop you, but I beg
of you: don't try to put me in
one, okay?
Kirito
1040241_6_a
Hehehehe!
Strea
1040241_5_a
Are you still going on about those
uniforms, Strea? You are seriously
obsessed.
Kirito

Yui

bg_18_tower_road
I want to see everyone wearing
a sailor uniform!
Strea
1040241_1_a
Thanks!
I'm gonna try it on!
Yuuki
1040238_16_a
I'm sure it will look great
on you, Yuuki!
Asuna
1040238_15_a
It's a chic design with the long
skirt... It's very fitting for a
real maid's uniform, isn't it?
Asuna
1040238_14_a
Hehe! It feels a bit like
a class change!
Yuuki
1040238_13_a
Thanks, Asuna!
Yuuki
1040238_12_a
Congratulations, Yuuki!
Asuna
1040238_11_a
I now permit you to use the
title of "tweeny."
Head Maid
1040238_9_a
Yuuki
1040238_10_a
As our new tweeny, I would like
you to accept this dress along
with my thanks, Miss Yuuki.
Head Maid
1040238_8_a
Ma'am...
Uh, is this...?
Yuuki
1040238_7_a
All this time I thought it was
lost, but it seems like it was
put there for safekeeping.
Head Maid
1040238_6_a
I see... The basement under
the store room...
Head Maid
1040238_5_a
Thank you! Turns out it was in
a treasure chest in the basement
of the storeroom!

There's something on the ground!
Wow, a treasure chest!

Oh! It comes to a dead end
over there!
Asuna

bg_event_remains
An underground passage...
It's like it goes on forever.
Yuuki
1040237_18_a
You bet!
Asuna
1040237_17_a
Want to check it out?
Yuuki
1040237_16_a
Yeah. Who would have expected
to find that in a storeroom?
Asuna
1040237_15_a
Whoa, there's a staircase under
here... It's like the entrance to
a secret room!
Yuuki
1040237_14_a
Wow, you're right!
Let's open it!
Asuna
1040237_13_a
Look at this part of the floor!
There's some kind of hatch
you can lift up!
Yuuki
1040237_12_a
What is it?
Asuna
1040237_11_a
Ah!
Yuuki
1040237_10_a
Yeah...
Yuuki
1040237_9_a
But unfortunately...
I can't find that tweeny uniform
anywhere.
Asuna

Asuna
1040237_7_a
Yeah, my throat feels scratchy
just looking at it!
Yuuki
1040237_6_a
It makes you feel like you're
about to suffocate on dust alone.
Asuna

Ha ha! Yeah... The devs really
outdid themselves on the
particle animation.

1040235_21_a
The head maid said that if
I find it, I can keep it, so
I think I'll go and take a look!
Yuuki
1040235_20_a
Wow, really?
Yuuki
1040235_19_a
so it really looks like it hasn't
been opened up for years!
Asuna
1040235_18_a
Yuuki
1040235_17_a
The devs filled the place with
tons of dust,
Asuna
1040235_16_a
Oh, I know! There's a storeroom
in the garden, isn't there?
Asuna
1040235_15_a
Right...
Yuuki
1040235_14_a
then it's got to be somewhere
people don't normally go, right?
Asuna
1040235_13_a
I see... But if it's been missing
for a long time,
Asuna
1040235_12_a
Nobody knows if it's even still
on the estate.
Yuuki
1040235_11_a
The head maid said someone
lost it a long time ago.
Yuuki
1040235_10_a
But there's a problem.
I'm supposed to wear
a special tweeny uniform, but...
Yuuki
1040235_9_a
All that hard work is paying off!
Asuna
1040235_8_a
Didn't the head maid say as much?
Your improvements are
a credit to the estate.
Asuna
1040235_7_a
My maid skills are nowhere near
as high as yours, Asuna...
Yuuki
1040235_6_a
Ha ha, yeah...
But seriously, why pick me?
Yuuki
1040235_5_a
It sounds like you've been picked
for a really important job!
Asuna
1040235_4_a
Tweenies had to do a lot
on real estates back in
the old days.
Asuna
1040235_3_a
Yuuki
1040235_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Wow, Yuuki!
That's amazing!
Asuna
1040235_1_a
...?
Yuuki
1040233_13_a
Unfortunately, we haven't seen
our tweeny uniform for years...
Head Maid
1040233_12_a
Whoa...
So it's like multiclassing in an RPG?
Yuuki
1040233_11_a
It's short for "between maid."
It would suit a multi-talented
all-rounder such as you.
Head Maid
1040233_10_a
T-Tweeny?
Yuuki
1040233_9_a
In recognition of that...
I'd like to assign you
to the position of tweeny.
Head Maid
1040233_8_a
Miss Yuuki, your recent
improvements as a maid have
been a credit to our estate.
Head Maid
1040233_7_a
Y-Yes, ma'am!
How may I be of service?
Yuuki
1040233_6_a
A word, if you please,
Miss Yuuki.
Head Maid
1040233_5_a
Especially since I heard that
raising nursemaid skills improves
your healing magic.
Yuuki
1040233_4_a
Next up, I think I'll try giving
my nursemaid skills a boost!
Yuuki
1040233_3_a
Since I've already improved my
scullery maid skills quite a bit...
Yuuki
1040233_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
What's next...? Hmm, was it
sweeping the kitchen?
Yuuki
1040233_1_a
Interesting...
Asuna
1040231_20_a
But even that feels fulfilling
somehow!
Yuuki
1040231_19_a
Heh... I just got scolded.
Yuuki
1040231_18_a
Ah, yes, ma'am!
Yuuki
1040231_17_a
Asuna
1040231_16_a
Miss Yuuki!
Focus on your work!
Head Maid
1040231_15_a
Hehe! I'm glad to hear that.
Asuna
1040231_14_a
So doing chores in a virtual world
feels so fresh and new!
Yuuki
1040231_13_a
Asuna
1040231_12_a
I never did much housework
back in the real world...
Yuuki
1040231_11_a
Yeah! Once you get used to it,
it's actually pretty fun.
Yuuki
1040231_10_a
Hehe! You say that, Yuuki, but
you seem to be enjoying yourself.
Asuna
1040231_9_a
Waaaah!! So much to do!
Yuuki
1040231_8_a
Head Maid
1040231_7_a
Understood, ma'am!
Yuuki
1040231_6_a
After that, please trim and water
the flower garden.
Head Maid
1040231_5_a
And when you're done with that,
please be sure to tidy up the
room.
Head Maid
1040231_4_a
Yes, ma'am!
Right away.
Yuuki
1040231_3_a
Yuuki
1040231_2_a

Miss Yuuki! Please see the guests
in the drawing room off.

I'm honored to fight by your side!

We owe you one for keeping Silica
safe, Pina!
Kirito

Asuna

Whoa, Pina! You were Silica's
feathery little dragon in shining
armor this time, huh?

Chirp CHIRP!
Pina

Hehehe, not at all. Why would
I be lonely? I had Pina to keep
me company!
Silica
1040228_15_a
Kirito
1040228_14_a
But, Silica, weren't you lonely
all by yourself? It must've been
tough.
Asuna
1040228_13_a
Pollen? Okay, if you insist...
Liz
1040228_12_a
N-No, I wasn't! I just got pollen
in my eyes, that's all!
Silica
1040228_11_a
And what's this? Your eyes are
all puffy... Were you crying?
Liz
1040228_10_a
What's wrong, Silica?
You seem down.

1040228_9_a

Don't mention it...
Silica

Thanks for clearing that quest,
Silica. We owe you one.

Look! I can see Thumbelina here in
the list of finished fairy tales.

Yes

Wow, Silica... You got to be
Thumbelina? Sounds rough.

Hold on tight!
Swallow
1040227_30_a
You're right... Let's go!
Silica
1040227_29_a
Come on, Silica. Everyone's
waiting for us.
Pina
1040227_28_a
So...it'll all be over...
Silica
1040227_27_a
Climb upon my back, Thumbelina!
I shall take you to your home,
and your journey shall end.
Swallow
1040227_26_a
You...did?
Silica
1040227_25_a
That's right, and I've come to
help you.
Swallow
1040227_24_a
Who's there?! Oh! It's a swallow!
Silica
1040227_23_a
Thumbelina! I've found you!
???
1040227_22_a
Y-Yeah... Okay. 
sniff
Silica
1040227_21_a
So no more of that talk, Silica!
Okay?
Pina
1040227_20_a
Pina...
Silica
1040227_19_a
You'll be able to hear my
voice again.
Pina
1040227_18_a
You and I can always talk.
And maybe, just maybe,
if you listen really hard...
Pina
1040227_17_a
It's all right, Silica. Didn't
I already tell you?
Pina
1040227_16_a
Silica...
Pina
1040227_15_a
But if we do that, I won't be able
to talk to you like this anymore!
I don't want to lose that!
Silica
1040227_14_a
We have to finish Thumbelina's
tale, right?
Pina
1040227_13_a
We need to get you back to your
normal size and find everyone.
Pina
1040227_12_a
What are you saying, Silica?
Pina
1040227_11_a
I... I don't think I want to go
back to normal.
Silica
1040227_10_a
What's wrong, Silica?
Pina
1040227_9_a
Pina...
Silica
1040227_8_a
Hehe. No, thank you! I'm just glad
I can be with you too. In SAO,
here, and forevermore.
Pina
1040227_7_a
Pina... Thank you so, so much for
always sticking by my side...
Silica
1040227_6_a
Yeah... Thumbelina sure had it
rough. I think I would've given up
already if not for you, Pina.
Silica
1040227_5_a
It's been one thing after
another, hasn't it?
Pina
1040227_4_a
Yeah. First it was the frog,
and then that mole grabbed you...
Pina
1040227_3_a
Pina
1040227_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_sunset
Wow, we really came a long way.
Silica
1040227_1_a
Yeah!
Silica
1040225_22_a
Now come on, Silica! We have to
figure out how to get back to
where we last saw everyone.
Pina
1040225_21_a
Ah ha ha! That's good to hear.
I feel the same, Silica!
Pina
1040225_20_a
But now that I can talk to you,
I feel like I can do anything!
Silica
1040225_19_a
I was really worried when I
realized that I got stuck in
Thumbelina's story...
Silica
1040225_18_a
Silica?
Pina
1040225_17_a
Hehe...
Silica
1040225_16_a
Wow... I never knew that...
Silica
1040225_15_a
It is? I can always understand
you, so it doesn't seem very
different from usual.
Pina
1040225_14_a
This is like a dream come true!
I always wanted to talk to you
like this!
Silica
1040225_13_a
Ah ha ha, that sounds like a good
enough explanation for me.
Pina
1040225_12_a
I could talk to that frog before,
so maybe it has something to do
with me getting shrunk?
Silica
1040225_11_a
This is certainly odd. I'm talking
like I always do, but you can
understand me now. I wonder why...
Pina
1040225_10_a
Huh? Oh. Oh my. I suppose I can.
Pina
1040225_9_a
P-P-PI-PIN-PINA?!
YOU CAN TALK?!
Silica
1040225_8_a
What's wrong, Silica?
Pina
1040225_7_a
Wait a sec... PINA?!
Silica
1040225_6_a
Thanks, Pina. It sounds like it
won't be easy, but if I just
Silica
1040225_5_a
That's right, Silica.
Pina
1040225_4_a
In the end, she befriends a
swallow who carries her back home.
Silica
1040225_3_a
Pina
1040225_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
If I remember right, Thumbelina is
kidnapped by a horrid frog, but
she escapes and travels all over.
Silica
1040225_1_a
I think I finally realized what
story this is supposed to be.
Thumbelina!
Silica
1040223_22_a
Chirp...

Are you all right, Pina?

Come, wife! Our future awaits!
Frog
1040223_12_a
No waaay!
Silica
1040223_11_a
Hwah hwah hwah! What a pretty
little girl! I shall make you
my bride!
Frog
1040223_10_a
Or maybe it's just a normal frog?
Judging by its size
Silica
1040223_9_a
Ahh! A giant frog monster!
Silica
1040223_8_a
Ribbit! Ribbit!
???
1040223_7_a

What am I gonna do?
Silica
1040223_6_a
And there's no way I'll catch up
to them if they're that big...
Silica

I guess they couldn't hear me...

Oh no... They ran off to look
for me, but I'm right here...

AHH! They didn't get bigger!
I got smaller!!
Silica
1040221_27_a
Wait a second...
Don't tell me...

What is it, Pina?
Wow, yeah. That IS a big flower!

Wh-What's going on?! Everyone
suddenly got gigantic!

Hellooo?! Right here!
Guys?! HELLO?!

here right this instant!

What's going on?! She was right
here!

Agreed...
HUH?!

through these fairy tales!

Hehe, and that finishes up another
fairy tale!
Silica

Glad to hear it.
Keep up the good work, Liz.
Kirito
1040218_23_a
Alright, you've convinced me.
And truth be told, it's kinda fun
taking charge out there.
Liz
1040218_22_a
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.
Liz
1040218_21_a
Don't say that. You're the only
one who can do what you do!
Kirito
1040218_20_a
I'm here to prop up the rest of
the gang.
Liz
1040218_19_a
sigh
... But not 'cause I'm cute
or anything.
Liz
1040218_18_a
Right. And you're perfect for that
role, Liz.
Kirito
1040218_17_a
there wouldn't be much reason for
people to go see live music,
would there...?
Liz
1040218_16_a
Without someone to drive things
forward on stage, or during
a show,
Liz
1040218_15_a
Yeah, I guess you're right.
And I guess that goes for real
supergroups, too.
Liz
1040218_14_a
That's essential in a supergroup
like this.
Kirito
1040218_13_a
Even when we have events here in
VR, you manage to light
up the room.
Kirito
1040218_12_a
Be it when we're out adventuring,
or just hanging out in real life.
Kirito
1040218_11_a
You set the mood out there.
You make it fun for everyone.
Kirito
1040218_10_a
I... Hmm...
Liz
1040218_9_a
No, that's just a bonus.
You OWN that stage.
Kirito

Really? That's it?!
Liz
1040218_7_a
No! Not at all!
I mean, you are, but
Kirito
1040218_6_a
Am I supposed to be some sort of
joke machine, or MC?
Liz
1040218_5_a
So? Have you figured out what you
bring to the group?
Kirito

Thanks, Kirito...

Was that supposed to be a
compliment, Silica?!

I wish I had your silver tongue!
Silica

I know! And you never look
nervous, either!

1040215_30_a
I think you'll figure it out in no
time.
Kirito
1040215_29_a
Look, don't overthink it.
Just reflect on the next show
after it's over.
Kirito
1040215_28_a
Ugh, are you kidding?
Liz
1040215_27_a
It's not about whether it's great
or not. I just think you should
figure that out on your own.
Kirito
1040215_26_a
Oh, NOW you want to get all
secretive! It can't be that great,
so spit it out!
Liz
1040215_25_a
I'd... better not say.
Kirito
1040215_24_a
So what do I bring to the table?
Liz
1040215_23_a
Wow, you're really laying it on
thick...
Liz
1040215_22_a
It doesn't matter who's in "first"
or "last." You all bring something
unique to the group.
Kirito
1040215_21_a
Sorry... I could've chosen my
words more carefully there.
You're not a loser.
Kirito
1040215_20_a
And besides, there's always a
winner and a loser in those
things. That's just how it works.
Kirito
1040215_19_a
Ah, that's just a PR stunt to keep
people interested in the group.
Kirito
1040215_18_a
There was a fan-run poll asking
which one of us was the most
popular. I came in last.
Liz
1040215_17_a
It is. I know it is.
Liz
1040215_16_a
That's not really true, is it?
Kirito
1040215_15_a
I honestly think I'd be better as
a manager.
Liz
1040215_14_a
I don't think I'm cut out for the
superstar life.
Liz
1040215_13_a
It's just that I, uh... don't exactly
have what the others do, if you
know what I mean...
Liz
1040215_12_a
It's not that I DON'T want to do
it anymore...
Liz
1040215_11_a
Liz...
Kirito
1040215_10_a
sigh
You've seen right through
everything else. No use trying to
hide it now.
Liz
1040215_9_a
Well, I...!
Liz
1040215_8_a
Is it because you're tired of
being one of the stars?
Kirito
1040215_7_a
So, tell me why you really want to
become a manager.
Kirito
1040215_6_a
...
Liz
1040215_5_a
but like I pointed out earlier,
EVERYTHING has a number.
Even moods and emotions.
Kirito
1040215_4_a
Now, there are a lot of stats that
can be raised with practice,
Kirito
1040215_3_a
Kirito
1040215_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
...
Liz
1040215_1_a
Are you SERIOUS?!
Liz
1040213_21_a
That's...you, actually.
Kirito
1040213_20_a
Her stats are in freefall, whoever
it is!
Liz
1040213_19_a
Whoa, whose is this?!
Liz
1040213_18_a
Now, take a look at this biorhythm
over here...
Kirito
1040213_17_a
Man, I'm really glad I asked to
learn more about this! All this
data is great to have!
Liz
1040213_16_a
Ahh, I see.
Wow, this is pretty nice!
Liz
1040213_15_a
And now I can run a simulation
that'll tell me how often she
needs to train to improve.
Kirito
1040213_14_a
That tells me she needs more voice
training.
Kirito
1040213_13_a
Here, look. The power of Leafa's
voice has been falling, right?
Kirito
1040213_12_a
Hmm... I guess you're right...
And you already have it, anyway.
Liz
1040213_11_a
So I need to know this stuff.
Kirito
1040213_10_a
But managers have to make sure
everyone in the band is
healthy.
Kirito
1040213_9_a
You're...not wrong.
Kirito
1040213_8_a
That's not what I meant!
This is personal info, mister!
Liz
1040213_7_a
so it keeps tabs on everything the
system does.
Kirito
1040213_6_a
Limited time only or not, it's
still a VRMMO,
Kirito
1040213_5_a
Whoa, what the heck is this?!
You've even got readings on mood
and vital signs!
Liz
1040213_4_a
Wow, you've got some really
detailed stats. I didn't realize
there were so many!
Liz
1040213_3_a
Liz
1040213_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
This graph shows how each group
member's biorhythm affects
their singing ability.
Kirito
1040213_1_a
Uh, sure...
Kirito
1040211_17_a
Great! I'll get started right
away. Care to show me the ropes?
Liz
1040211_16_a
Hmm, okay, you're building a
convincing case.
Kirito
1040211_15_a
Well, I really like games about
collecting data and seeing what
works! I'm a blacksmith, after all.
Liz
1040211_14_a
But isn't that the whole point
of it? Isn't it all one big
management sim?
Liz
1040211_13_a
You've wanted to try busywork?
Because that's all management is
in this game.
Kirito
1040211_12_a
Aww, c'mon! I've always wanted to
try something like this!
Liz
1040211_11_a
and I'm not just saying that
because it doesn't happen in
the real world, either.
Kirito
1040211_10_a
I can't make one of the performers
take on those duties,
Kirito
1040211_9_a
So I figured I'd offer to help
share the load a little!
Liz
1040211_8_a
you schedule all the shows on our
tour... That's a lot for one guy!
Liz
1040211_7_a
Well I was thinking about it,
y'know. You manage all our
training schedules,
Liz
1040211_6_a
Huh? Why?
Kirito
1040211_5_a
Need any help with the management
job?
Liz
1040211_4_a
What is it, Liz?
Kirito
1040211_3_a
Kirito
1040211_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
Hey, psst! Kirito!
Liz
1040211_1_a
Ahaha!
Strea
1040208_29_a
Strea!!
Let's not get specific now!
Silica
1040208_28_a
I bet you'll get taller, and
you'll even grow hips and a pair
of huge
Strea
1040208_27_a
Yeah, that's the spirit! And
you're still a growing girl!
You'll fill out!
Strea
1040208_26_a
So current body image problems
aside, I want to keep my SAO
avatar forever and ever!
Silica
1040208_25_a
Besides, while my real body ages
and changes, I'll always be the
same here in VR.
Silica
1040208_24_a
This may sound strange, but I
think I consider it a badge of
honor of sorts.
Silica
1040208_23_a
Yeah. This avatar is the proof
that I survived that death game.
Silica
1040208_22_a
I get it
and agree. I think it
would be a mistake to try to
forget about what happened in SAO.
Strea
1040208_21_a
Ehehe, I guess I just picked this
avatar unconsciously and only
realized the real reason now.
Silica
1040208_20_a
Silica...
Strea
1040208_19_a
This avatar helps remind me of who
I was in SAO, and the good times
as well as the bad.
Silica
1040208_18_a
Good or bad, the things that
happened to me in SAO mattered.
They shaped who I am today.
Silica
1040208_17_a
But it wasn't all bad. I met
wonderful, amazing people too.
Silica
1040208_16_a
What I went through in SAO was
extremely traumatic.
Silica
1040208_15_a
Oh, yeah... I remember that
conversation. So, what about it?
Strea
1040208_14_a
About why I didn't change my
avatar when I converted over to
ALO...
Silica
1040208_13_a
About that question you asked
me...
Silica
1040208_12_a
Yes?
Strea
1040208_11_a
Um, Strea?
Silica
1040208_10_a
...
Silica
1040208_9_a
You got it!
Strea
1040208_8_a
I'm counting on you, Strea!
Silica
1040208_7_a
This time I'm not gonna mess up!
I swear it!
Strea
1040208_6_a
So, let's head back to town and
make you a new
correctly-sized
cheerleader outfit!
Strea
1040208_5_a
Strea
1040208_4_a
Yes. We've got them all.
Silica
1040208_3_a
Silica
1040208_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Hurray! We did it! That was the
last item we needed!
Strea
1040208_1_a
Silica...?
Strea
1040207_29_a
So why did I keep this avatar when
I converted over from SAO?
I'm not really sure myself...
Silica
1040207_28_a
When I first dove into SAO,
the avatar I made was really
grown-up-looking and cool...
Silica
1040207_27_a
N-No... I never thought about it,
but I suppose you're right...
Silica
1040207_26_a
Oh, um, sorry...
Did I say something to upset you?
Strea
1040207_25_a
...
Silica
1040207_24_a
why didn't you pick an avatar that
was everything you wanted to be?
Strea
1040207_23_a
So if you aren't happy with your
real world appearance,
Strea
1040207_22_a
Or at least, that's what I've
heard...
Strea
1040207_21_a
VR games are a form of wish
fulfillment in that regard...
Strea
1040207_20_a
Most people choose the look of
the person they wish they could be
for their VRMMO avatar.
Strea
1040207_19_a
Oh...!
W-Well, umm...
Silica
1040207_18_a
But if you really feel that way,
why did you choose this body for
your ALO avatar?
Strea
1040207_17_a
You're always talking about how
you want to grow up quick,
or fill out like Asuna...
Strea
1040207_16_a
Get what?
Silica
1040207_15_a
Silica, I'm an NPC, so maybe
I don't really get it...
Strea
1040207_14_a
Strea, is everything okay?
Silica
1040207_13_a
...
Strea
1040207_12_a
Yep!
Silica
1040207_11_a
I'm not surprised! Your avatar's
small size makes you extra agile!
Strea
1040207_10_a
I beat them all up real quick last
time!
Silica
1040207_9_a
Yeah, but it's pretty small. I'm
good at fighting those monsters!
Silica
1040207_8_a
The only way to get the next item
is from a specific monster drop.
Strea
1040207_7_a
You got it!
Silica
1040207_6_a
Let's keep it up and hit the next
spot!
Strea
1040207_5_a
Silica
1040207_4_a
Yeah! We're making great progress!
Strea
1040207_3_a
I found one too!
Silica
1040207_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Ah! I found one!
Strea
1040207_1_a
...
Strea
1040205_20_a
sigh
...
Silica
1040205_19_a
Oh. Yeah. I forgot... SAO player
avatars were forcefully set to
their real world parameters...
Strea
1040205_18_a
Our avatars were converted over,
so they're essentially our real
bodies...
Silica
1040205_17_a
Oh. That. Actually, me, Liz, and
the other girls from SAO...
Silica
1040205_16_a
Your real body's in the real
world...
Strea
1040205_15_a
Umm... Silica? You realize you're
an avatar here, right?
Strea
1040205_14_a
Yes... I guess I'm still just a
little kid...
Silica
1040205_13_a
Wait, that's what you're upset
about?
Strea
1040205_12_a
The differences in our figures has
been hammered home... Painfully.
So very painfully...
Silica
1040205_11_a
sigh
...
Silica
1040205_10_a
Silica... Was it really that much
of a shock?
Strea
1040205_9_a
sigh
...
Silica
1040205_8_a
H-Hey, don't be blue! We'll find
them all in no time!
Strea
1040205_7_a
sigh
...
Silica
1040205_6_a
Sorry I wasted all those materials
you gathered... I'll help you
find replacements...
Strea
1040205_5_a
sigh
...
Silica
1040205_4_a
Yeah, definitely not good...
Strea
1040205_3_a
Strea
1040205_2_a
bg_21_alne_inn
sniff
...
Silica
1040205_1_a
Maybe...
Well, I might as well try it...
Silica
1040203_30_a
Who knows? Maybe you look great in
baggy clothes! Like, big poofy
sleeves can be cute, right?
Strea
1040203_29_a
W-Well, why not try it on at
least?
Strea
1040203_28_a
No, it's not your fault...
I knew, but I forgot to ask you...
Silica
1040203_27_a
I'm so sorry, Silica!
I didn't realize!
Strea
1040203_26_a
But... 
sniff
This is too big and
roomy...in multiple places I wish
it wasn't...
Silica
1040203_25_a
Which means it's still set to my
size parameters...
Strea
1040203_24_a
Oh yeah! I think I did that!
Strea
1040203_23_a
For custom models like this...
I think you're supposed to adjust
the details when you make it...
Silica
1040203_22_a
B-But that's only supposed to
apply to official game items!
Silica
1040203_21_a
Clothes in ALO automatically
adjust themselves to fit the
avatar, don't they?
Strea
1040203_20_a
Size? Umm, I don't know.
I didn't set anything specific.
Strea
1040203_19_a
What size is this supposed to be?
Silica
1040203_18_a
Um... I... But... Strea...?!
Silica
1040203_17_a
Huh? What's wrong, Silica?
Strea
1040203_16_a
And...WHAAAT?!
Silica
1040203_15_a
Yeah, go for it!
Strea
1040203_14_a
I'm going to try it on right away!
Silica
1040203_13_a
Hey, no problem!
Strea
1040203_12_a
Yay! Thank you so much, Strea!
Silica
1040203_11_a
Ta-dah! One cheerleader outfit,
as ordered!
Strea
1040203_10_a
Alright!
Silica
1040203_9_a
Alright, I'm going to make it
right now! Sit there. I'll be done
in a jiffy!
Strea
1040203_8_a
Yup! This should be enough to
make it!
Strea
1040203_7_a
We have one of these
and one of these...
Strea
1040203_6_a
Yup! So, how do they look?
Are there enough?
Silica
1040203_5_a
bg_21_alne_inn
Silica
1040203_4_a
Hi Silica! These are for your copy
of my patented custom cheerleader
outfit, right?
Strea
1040203_3_a
bg_21_alne_inn
Strea! I brought the materials!
Silica
1040203_2_a
Strea
1040203_1_a
Silica
1040201_16_a
Great! I'll be waiting!
Strea
1040201_15_a
Yes, of course! Thank you very
much! I'll get them right away!
Silica
1040201_14_a
Of course I can! Can I ask you to
bring me the materials, though?
Strea
1040201_13_a
So I was wondering if you could
make another of those for me?
Silica
1040201_12_a
I heard that you already made a
custom one for yourself...
Silica
1040201_11_a
Sure, no problem!
Strea
1040201_10_a
U-Umm... I want a cheerleader
outfit, like the one Asuna and
Yui wore...
Silica
1040201_9_a
In that case, I'm your girl!
What do you want me to make?
Strea
1040201_8_a
Oh, I get it! You need my amazing
sewing skills!
Strea
1040201_7_a
No, it's not a weapon or armor or
anything. It's clothing!
Silica
1040201_6_a
Equipment? I think that's Liz's
specialty, not mine...
Strea
1040201_5_a
Strea
1040201_4_a
There's this equipment I really
want you to make for me...
Silica
1040201_3_a
Oh, hi Silica.
What's up?
Strea
1040201_2_a
bg_21_alne
S-Strea!
Silica
1040201_1_a
I said NO! Sorry, but I don't ever
want to feel that sensation again!
Sinon
1040198_24_a
What?! But it's our only chance to
find out for sure! Come on!
Kirito
1040198_23_a
N-No way! I'm taking this stupid
thing off right now!
Sinon
1040198_22_a
Well, we'll find out for sure if
we wander around here and fight
a couple more mobs.
Kirito
1040198_21_a
gulp
...
Sinon
1040198_20_a
I mean, you hadn't fought any
mobs with that item equipped
until just now, right?
Kirito
1040198_19_a
That's my best guess based off of
what just happened.
Kirito
1040198_18_a
What, like her horns can sense
a monster's presence?
Asuna
1040198_17_a
Probably...
Kirito
1040198_16_a
Are you saying that sensation was
some sort of monster alarm?!
Sinon
1040198_15_a
Wh-What?
Sinon
1040198_14_a
Huh?!
Asuna
1040198_13_a
Maybe your horns send out some
sort of electric pulse when mobs
get too close.
Kirito
1040198_12_a
I feel totally normal again.
What WAS that...?
Sinon
1040198_11_a
That sensation faded away while
we were fighting.
Sinon
1040198_10_a
Yeah... I'm fine now...
Sinon
1040198_9_a
Are you okay, Sinon?
Kirito
1040198_8_a
...
Sinon
1040198_7_a
I don't know...
Kirito
1040198_6_a
Could that have been some sort
of event?
Asuna
1040198_5_a
Well, that was quite the
unpleasant surprise...
Asuna
1040198_4_a
Sinon
1040198_3_a
Asuna
1040198_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Phew...
Kirito
1040198_1_a
Y-Yeah... Nyaah! I'll f-figure
something out!
Sinon
1040197_31_a
Can you manage, Sinon?!
Kirito
1040197_30_a
Then we'll just have to fight it!
Kirito
1040197_29_a
It's coming straight at us!
Asuna
1040197_28_a
A monster?!
Kirito
1040197_27_a
Graaaaaaoooooh!
Monster
1040197_26_a
What are you looking at, Asuna?
Is there something in the sky over
the
ah!
Kirito
1040197_25_a
What's going on...?
Ahh!
Asuna
1040197_24_a
Th-That's what I said! Hnnggaaaah!
Sinon
1040197_23_a
So you're getting some sort of
weird sensation?
Kirito
1040197_22_a
M-My tail... Mrrraaah!
Sinon
1040197_21_a
I-It feels like... Hrrrk! Like
when someone touches...
Nyaah!
Sinon
1040197_20_a
Sinonon, are you okay?!
Asuna
1040197_19_a
Wh-What the hell?!
Sinon
1040197_18_a
Eurgh!
Nyaaah! Mraaah!
Sinon
1040197_17_a
Huh?!
Kirito
1040197_16_a
Hngggh!
Sinon
1040197_15_a
Sinon, what's wrong?
Kirito
1040197_14_a
...!
Sinon
1040197_13_a
N-Not at all!
Kirito
1040197_12_a
Hold it right there, mister.
You're having way too much fun
making me be your guinea pig.
Sinon
1040197_11_a
What else can we try?
Kirito
1040197_10_a
I really thought those horns would
have some sort of attack ability,
but I guess not...
Kirito
1040197_9_a
I can't believe you, Asuna!
Sinon
1040197_8_a
Hahaha... But you were so cute,
trying to destroy that tree!
Asuna
1040197_7_a
by head-butting something over and
over and over!
Sinon
1040197_6_a
You think?! Maybe YOU should take
my place and test these horns
Sinon
1040197_5_a
Hmmm... Maybe I was wrong...
Kirito
1040197_4_a
Asuna
1040197_3_a
Kirito
1040197_2_a
bg_18_mountain
This isn't working at all...
Sinon
1040197_1_a
A hidden ability?
Sinon
1040195_25_a
Maybe instead of taming, there's
another ability those horns have
that we don't know about.
Kirito
1040195_24_a
They had that item specially made
by the devs, after all.
Kirito
1040195_23_a
But I think that's just one part
of it.
Kirito
1040195_22_a
Yeah...
Kirito
1040195_21_a
So that item actually interferes
with a Cait Sith's abilities...
Asuna
1040195_20_a
That explains a lot...
Sinon
1040195_19_a
I actually haven't heard that
alert go off.
Sinon
1040195_18_a
Oh... Um...
Now that you mention it...
Sinon
1040195_17_a
So now that you don't have your
ears, does that mean you won't
get that alert too?
Kirito
1040195_16_a
That's handy.
Kirito
1040195_15_a
or during battle if a mob gets
into a state where you can
tame it.
Sinon
1040195_14_a
They sound an alert if there's a
monster you can tame nearby,
Sinon
1040195_13_a
Well, yeah. They help with taming.
Sinon
1040195_12_a
I was wondering. Are those ears
just for show, or do they have
some sort of ability?
Kirito
1040195_11_a
Wh-What? Quit staring at me like
that, Kirito!
Sinon
1040195_10_a
Still... Ears into horns...
Kirito
1040195_9_a
I suppose.
Sinon
1040195_8_a
Cool! Then that explains why your
ears turn into horns.
Asuna
1040195_7_a
and then the devs made it for us.
Sinon
1040195_6_a
Yeah. Sakuya told me that this
was actually designed by a player,
Sinon
1040195_5_a
Plus it's pretty amazing you can
even get a special item just for a
player-organized event.
Kirito
1040195_4_a
Asuna
1040195_3_a
Sinon
1040195_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
But it's not often items actually
alter parts of your avatar's body.
Kirito
1040195_1_a
Ahaha...
Asuna
1040193_21_a
S-Sinon, y-you're really scaring
me...
Kirito
1040193_20_a
Whose fault do you think it is
I had to put this ridiculous thing
on again, anyway?
Sinon
1040193_19_a
I'd shut up if I were you.
Sinon
1040193_18_a
Unless you have a death wish,
Sinon
1040193_17_a
Hahaha!
Kirito
1040193_16_a
I thought you hated wearing that
thing, but I guess I was wrong.
It's grown on you, huh?
Kirito
1040193_15_a
Oh hey, that's the outfit you wore
during the Setsubun battle,
isn't it?
Kirito
1040193_14_a
Hng...!
Sinon
1040193_13_a
Hi, Kirito!
Asuna
1040193_12_a
Asuna
1040193_11_a
Oh, hey Asuna, hey Sinon.
Kirito
1040193_10_a
I didn't ask for an explanation...
Sinon
1040193_9_a
so I suppose they turn into horns
when you equip that outfit!
Asuna
1040193_8_a
Hehe, those are ogre horns! Cait
Siths normally have really long
cat ears,
Asuna
1040193_7_a
N-Not even! I'm totally exposed to
attack, not to mention I've got
these dumb things on my head...
Sinon
1040193_6_a
But it's seriously adorable!
Aaahh, that's so cool!
Asuna
1040193_5_a
I thought it might have been
pretty scary, considering it's
an ogre...
Asuna
1040193_4_a
Aaahh, that is SO cute!
Asuna
1040193_3_a
Asuna
1040193_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
W-Well...?
Sinon
1040193_1_a
Yay! Thank you, Sinonon!
Asuna
1040191_20_a
But just for a second!
Sinon
1040191_19_a
Oh, fine! If that's what it takes
to get you off my case!
Sinon
1040191_18_a
...
Sinon
1040191_17_a
So then you'll show me?
Asuna
1040191_16_a
Th-That's not true...
Sinon
1040191_15_a
Why am I the only one who
doesn't get to see?
Asuna
1040191_14_a
Aw, come on! You let Kirito and
Leafa and everyone else see you
in it!
Asuna
1040191_13_a
N-No way! That getup is way too
embarrassing!
Sinon
1040191_12_a
So show me already!
Asuna
1040191_11_a
Did they...? Now that I think about
it, that info could've leaked out
through a hundred people...
Sinon
1040191_10_a
They said you looked adorable!
Asuna
1040191_9_a
but then I heard about it from
Leafa and Silica too!
Asuna
1040191_8_a
Y-Yeah... I mean, he was the first
one to tell me,
Asuna
1040191_7_a
Ugh, Kirito told you, didn't he!
Sinon
1040191_6_a
Wh-What?! H-How the heck do you
know about that?!
Sinon
1040191_5_a
I want to see the ogre avatar
that you used for that Setsubun
battle!
Asuna
1040191_4_a
Asuna? What is it?
Sinon
1040191_3_a
Sinon
1040191_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
There you are, Sinonon!
Asuna
1040191_1_a
Hehehe. I'll let you know if I
find any other quirks in the
point system!
Rika
1040188_19_a
Thanks!
Suguha
1040188_18_a
That we did.
Thank you, Rika!
Asuna
1040188_17_a
And thanks to your cunning plan,
we all had a blast today!
Keiko
1040188_16_a
Hehe, that's why you have to get
the inside line on these things!
Loopholes close eventually!
Rika
1040188_15_a
Hahaha, sure, you'll call and ask
AFTER you've taken advantage
of the system!
Asuna
1040188_14_a
That's really nice of you, Rika.
Suguha
1040188_13_a
and tell them that people using
points like this might be bad for
them.
Rika
1040188_12_a
You know, I think I'll contact
Kamura support tonight,
Rika
1040188_11_a
Though pulling this stunt too many
times could end up hurting the
businesses a little.
Rika
1040188_10_a
Yeah, that's all.
Asuna
1040188_9_a
We just made really good use of
our OS points!
Rika
1040188_8_a
It's fine, it's fine! We didn't
break any rules, Keiko.
Rika
1040188_7_a
It's like we broke the rules or
something!
Keiko
1040188_6_a
It feels a little strange, though,
having so much fun and eating
all that food without paying...
Keiko
1040188_5_a
Me too! The food was almost as
good as all the rides!
Suguha
1040188_4_a
Keiko
1040188_3_a
Rika
1040188_2_a
bg_os_town_1
I had so much fun today!
Asuna
1040188_1_a
I'm on it!
Suguha
1040187_22_a
Now, let's get the rest of these
passes! I'll tell you all the
tricks I know.
Rika
1040187_21_a
Just a matter of who had the
up-to-the-second intel in this
fight...er, game. I meant game.
Rika
1040187_20_a
It almost feels like you cheated!
Keiko
1040187_19_a
Wow, Rika! You really know how to
exploit stuff like this!
Asuna
1040187_18_a
So I applied my multiplier coupon
to all my points yesterday!
Rika
1040187_17_a
They didn't really advertise it.
I think they used that instead of
daily login bonuses.
Rika
1040187_16_a
I-I had no idea!
Keiko
1040187_15_a
and some capsules have coupons
that multiply your points.
Rika
1040187_14_a
There's a little capsule toy game
you can play once a day,
Rika
1040187_13_a
There's a section of mini-games
on this site.
Rika
1040187_12_a
How'd you get them all so fast?
Suguha
1040187_11_a
You what?! Oh my gosh,
that's incredible!
Asuna
1040187_9_a
Keiko
1040187_10_a
Guys? Hehehe...
I got them all!!
Rika
1040187_8_a
So they won't hand it over without
a fight, haha.
Asuna
1040187_7_a
I know. Probably because it costs
over 5,000 yen if you just buy it.
Asuna
1040187_6_a
Me too! That was the hardest part
in the end.
Suguha
1040187_5_a
I just need to exchange my points
for a pass!
Keiko
1040187_4_a
Suguha
1040187_3_a
Keiko
1040187_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Well, guys, how are we doing?
Rika
1040187_1_a
Okay, I'll tell Sinonon then.
Asuna
1040185_25_a
He SAYS he's not that into OS,
but I'll tell him anyway.
Suguha
1040185_24_a
Hmm, I don't know.
Asuna
1040185_23_a
Think Kazuto would do it?
Rika
1040185_22_a
Okay!
Suguha
1040185_21_a
Me too. We'll definitely have our
work cut out for us!
Asuna
1040185_20_a
It won't be easy, but I think
it's worth a try!
Rika
1040185_19_a
Hehe, so it says.
Well, what do we think?
Are we doing this?
Rika
1040185_18_a
You even get points for buying
Yuna's songs at karaoke!
Keiko
1040185_17_a
We could totally spend a whole
day at the amusement park
for free...
Suguha
1040185_16_a
Wow, this has turned into quite
a system!
Asuna
1040185_15_a
AND you can get a coupon for the
park's restaurant with the points
you earn at karaoke!
Rika
1040185_14_a
And you can use THOSE to get a
pass for five free games at the
arcade in the park!
Rika
1040185_13_a
But wait, there's more! This fast
food chain awards points too!
Rika
1040185_12_a
Keiko
1040185_11_a
It doesn't say we can't combine
offers...
Asuna
1040185_10_a
So you're saying we could use
the points from both to go to an
amusement park for free?
Suguha
1040185_9_a
Wow, right again!
Keiko
1040185_8_a
And this online store lets you
trade points for ride passes!
It awards fewer points, though.
Rika
1040185_7_a
She's right!
Asuna
1040185_6_a
We can trade the points from this
boutique for tickets to the
amusement park!
Rika
1040185_5_a
Both of which are partnered with
an amusement park in the city.
Rika
1040185_4_a
Keiko
1040185_3_a
Asuna
1040185_2_a
bg_os_town_2
We'll start with this boutique
and this online shop.
Rika
1040185_1_a
What way?
Asuna
1040183_23_a
We might be able to play OS
that way...
Rika
1040183_22_a
Actually...
Rika
1040183_21_a
Ha ha, I've heard him say that
too.
Rika
1040183_20_a
solutions in a simulation game is
where the real fun is.
Suguha
1040183_19_a
Kirito says finding the limited
number of perfectly optimized
Suguha
1040183_18_a
You have to be efficient and
optimize, but when it all just
works...it's absolutely stunning.
Rika
1040183_17_a
Yeah, exactly. You just keep
experimenting using the data
you've collected. It's fun!
Rika
1040183_16_a
Are those games without any sort
of reflex-based action elements?
Keiko
1040183_15_a
Then I could put all that to use
and make something. It felt
like playing a blacksmith sim.
Rika
1040183_14_a
Half the fun of smithing was
gathering data, repeating the
process, and gaining EXP...
Rika
1040183_13_a
Though I do enjoy making new
equipment and messing around
with different combinations...
Rika
1040183_12_a
That's one way of looking at it.
Asuna
1040183_11_a
AR is one thing, and VR is
another, and they're both fun in
their own ways.
Rika
1040183_10_a
You know, you're right. I guess
I didn't really notice it since
it's a totally new game.
Rika
1040183_9_a
Weapons and items all come from
drops, treasure chests, and
rewards.
Keiko
1040183_8_a
There's a crafting element, but it
feels tacked on. It's not a system
like in SAO and ALO.
Asuna
1040183_7_a
True, you can't coordinate your
weapons and armor, or make new
ones.
Suguha
1040183_6_a
There's no blacksmithing system
in it yet, for one.
Asuna
1040183_5_a
Huh? Why would I be?
Rika
1040183_4_a
Keiko
1040183_3_a
Rika
1040183_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Aren't you a little bit
underwhelmed with OS then?
Asuna
1040183_1_a
She says, humbly! Hahaha!
Asuna
1040181_19_a
I'm just trying to sniff out the
latest trends!
Rika
1040181_18_a
Oh come on. At least lead with
"You're such a great shopper!"
or something!
Rika
1040181_17_a
That's a very good point!
Rika, I think you might have what
it takes to be a blacksmith!
Asuna
1040181_16_a
Well, a blacksmith in a VRMMO needs
to keep up with new material
discoveries somehow, right?
Keiko
1040181_15_a
I mean...
It's not THAT impressive.
Rika
1040181_14_a
and yet you somehow keep up with
it all. I'm impressed!
Asuna
1040181_13_a
You almost need up-to-the-second
intel to know which shops have
sales,
Asuna
1040181_12_a
Nothing! You just seem to know all
about this promotion OS is running
with real-life stores and brands.
Asuna
1040181_11_a
What? What'd I do?
Rika
1040181_10_a
Wow, Rika! You're amazing!
Asuna
1040181_9_a
We should stop at this crepe shop
up here too. I've been saving up
their points!
Rika
1040181_8_a
Hehe, yeah, there are. We should
all go check them out sometime!
Rika
1040181_7_a
Oh man, there are SO many cute
accessories by that brand!
Suguha
1040181_6_a
Oh, this shop is also part of the
OS promotion!
Rika
1040181_5_a
Finally! We should hurry, though!
I heard it's first-come-first-
served!
Keiko
1040181_4_a
Asuna
1040181_3_a
Keiko
1040181_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Hey, this hamburger place
gives out coupons now!
Rika
1040181_1_a
Hehe, thanks!
Liz
1040168_28_a
And I know you can totally do
whatever you set your mind to.
Philia
1040168_27_a
Hehe, yeah, I know.
Philia
1040168_26_a
I mean, not as an attacker or
anything, but like for my dreams
and goals and life-stuff, y'know?
Liz
1040168_25_a
But now I'm gonna fight with
everything I got!
Liz
1040168_24_a
Liz...
Philia
1040168_23_a
Maybe I was trying too hard to
force myself into that mold...
Liz
1040168_22_a
I always thought if I could just
focus on being the best blacksmith
I could be, that'd be enough...
Liz
1040168_21_a
Yeah, I can see that now...
Liz
1040168_20_a
I got that same feeling the other
day, but I couldn't bring myself
to say anything...
Philia
1040168_19_a
Philia...
Liz
1040168_18_a
Like maybe you were forcing
yourself to be in the background...
Philia
1040168_17_a
But I could tell you were holding
back, in battle and during quests.
Philia
1040168_16_a
You're just such an open, honest
person, and you're never afraid
to speak your mind...
Philia
1040168_15_a
Hehe, you're giving me way too
much credit.
Philia
1040168_14_a
Liz...
Philia
1040168_13_a
Now I finally know you realized
that and tried to snap me out of
it. So thank you.
Liz
1040168_12_a
I guess... You know, I think I was
in a rut or something, like I had
stopped myself from growing.
Liz
1040168_11_a
You did?! That's amazing!
Philia
1040168_10_a
One where I had to go solo...
Liz
1040168_9_a
Well, I made it for myself and
used it to sneak through a
really hard quest.
Liz
1040168_8_a
I'm sorry?
Philia
1040168_7_a
That really saved me.
Liz
1040168_6_a
You know how you didn't buy the
Kunoichi from me when I offered?
Liz
1040168_5_a
For what?
Philia
1040168_4_a
Sorry to make you come all the way
here, but I wanted to thank you.
Liz
1040168_3_a
Liz
1040168_2_a
bg_18_tower_top
What's up, Liz?
Philia
1040168_1_a
Thanks!
Liz
1040167_17_a
Good luck, Liz!
Rain
1040167_16_a
Ahh, okay. That just might work!
Rain
1040167_15_a
Yep! So I'm gonna equip it and
see if I can't sneak my way
into that temple too!
Liz
1040167_14_a
That's the item that makes you
really good at hiding, right?
Rain
1040167_13_a
You know that Kunoichi everyone's
talking about? Well, I have enough
materials to make one.
Liz
1040167_12_a
Huh?
Rain
1040167_11_a
Oh... That must have been what
Philia was trying to get at...
She must have known...
Liz
1040167_10_a
But I'll never be able to stand on
my own two feet if I keep leaning
on the rest of you for support.
Liz
1040167_9_a
and I'm not a clever treasure
hunter like Philia either...
Liz
1040167_8_a
Hehe, yes, you made it very clear.
I know I'm not a trained fighter
like you or Kirito,
Liz
1040167_7_a
D-Did you hear the part where
I said how hard it was?!
Rain
1040167_6_a
I'm going to get my own on my
own merit.
Liz
1040167_5_a
Huh...?
Rain
1040167_4_a
But I can't take it. You earned
it, you keep it.
Liz
1040167_3_a
Rain
1040167_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
That's really sweet of you...
Liz
1040167_1_a
Rain...
Liz
1040165_27_a
I guess it was kind of miraculous
I even managed to get one... But
I did it once! I can do it again!
Rain
1040165_26_a
B-But you worked really hard
for this...
Liz
1040165_25_a
Plus I can always go back and
get another one for myself.
Rain
1040165_24_a
Well, I can tell you really
want it...
Rain
1040165_23_a
Huh? Why would you do that?
Liz
1040165_22_a
Um... Hey, how about I give this
to you?
Rain
1040165_21_a
N-Nothing...
Liz
1040165_20_a
Wh-What is it, Liz?
Rain
1040165_19_a
What!
Liz
1040165_18_a
I could never have fought my way
through solo, so I just snuck past
all the mobs.
Rain
1040165_17_a
Hahaha, my specialty is hiding,
remember?
Rain
1040165_16_a
Wow, you are seriously
impressive...
Liz
1040165_15_a
Yep. Not to mention you can't get
it unless you go solo.
Rain
1040165_14_a
Seriously? That place is swarming
with Evil Deities!
Liz
1040165_13_a
The ruins of an ancient temple in
a valley in the southern region of
the Leprechaun's territory.
Rain
1040165_12_a
I know! Where did you even find
it, Rain?
Liz
1040165_11_a
It also increases your dodge rate
and smith success rate too! It's
an all-in-one lucky charm!
Rain
1040165_10_a
Hehehe, it's nice, isn't it? And
it doesn't just increase your
skill success rate in battle.
Rain
1040165_9_a
What I wouldn't give to have one
too...
Liz
1040165_8_a
Whoa! That's awesome! I can't
believe you finally got it!
Liz
1040165_7_a
Ta-da! The luck-buffing,
Leprechaun-only Volundr's Ring!
Rain
1040165_6_a
Hehe, look what I got, Liz!
Rain
1040165_5_a
Ah, hey Rain! Come on in!
Liz
1040165_4_a
Heya!
???
1040165_3_a
I wonder what it was Philia
was holding back from me...
Liz
1040165_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
...
Liz
1040165_1_a
Then what is it?
Liz
1040163_23_a
Uh... Not exactly...
Philia
1040163_22_a
Huh? Why? Are you low on Yuld?
Liz
1040163_21_a
It's not that I don't want it,
but...I think I'll pass this time.
Philia
1040163_20_a
Um... Well...
Philia
1040163_19_a
Of course I'd still have to charge
you for it, but I'd give you a
good discount!
Liz
1040163_18_a
Oh! I could totally make it for
you, Philia! You'd really put it
to good use.
Liz
1040163_17_a
But...
Philia
1040163_16_a
Hehe, the only thing that'd be a
waste would be me using the
Kunoichi instead of one of you.
Liz
1040163_15_a
Or someone who could put it to
use in battle like Kirito or Asuna
or Leafa...
Liz
1040163_14_a
Someone who's always hunting for
treasure in places crawling with
super strong monsters...
Liz
1040163_13_a
I mean, that kind of item would
be way better suited to someone
like you.
Liz
1040163_12_a
What? But why?! It'd be a waste
not to!
Philia
1040163_11_a
Well, I thought about it a lot...
And I decided not to.
Liz
1040163_10_a
So what are you gonna do?
You gonna make it?
Philia
1040163_9_a
Hehe, thanks.
Liz
1040163_8_a
but I'm not surprised a superstar
blacksmith like you was able to
get them all no sweat!
Philia
1040163_7_a
It requires a whole lot of
rare materials,
Philia
1040163_6_a
Ooh, I've heard of that! It buffs
your hiding ability!
Philia
1040163_5_a
and it turns out I have enough to
make one of the new items. One
called Kunoichi.
Liz
1040163_4_a
Yeah. I took stock of what I had...
Liz
1040163_3_a
Liz
1040163_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Really? Agil said that?
Philia
1040163_1_a
Oh, uh... I guess...
Liz
1040161_25_a
Being a blacksmith puts you in a
good position to skip questing and
simply make whatever you want.
Agil
1040161_24_a
You've been too busy to go on
quests, but you've been collecting
plenty of spare materials, right?
Agil
1040161_23_a
What do you mean?
Liz
1040161_22_a
Hey, I don't suppose you've been
able to make one of those new
items for yourself, huh?
Agil
1040161_21_a
Sure thing.
Liz
1040161_20_a
Ahh, gotcha. Well, you know where
to find me if you ever feel like
selling any of your reserves.
Agil
1040161_19_a
That's why whenever I get a chance
to buy them for cheap, I take it.
Liz
1040161_18_a
I mean, you never know when you
might need them. Especially ore.
Liz
1040161_17_a
Hehe, I was kiddiiing. I am kind
of stockpiling spare materials,
though.
Liz
1040161_16_a
You can't believe anything he told
you! He blows everything WAY out
of proportion!
Agil
1040161_15_a
Wh-What? Like I'd try to con you!
I bet Kirito's been flapping his
trap again about back in SAO!
Agil
1040161_14_a
That kind of offer just sounds
fishy to me, is all...
Liz
1040161_13_a
H-Hey now, what's that suspicious
stare for?
Agil
1040161_12_a
...
Liz
1040161_11_a
What do you do when that happens?
If you got anything you don't
need, I'll buy it off you.
Agil
1040161_10_a
Oh, totally. All the time.
Liz
1040161_9_a
Yeah, sounds crazy. You get anyone
bringing you the wrong materials
at all?
Agil
1040161_8_a
Then I have to go out and look for
them on my own. Makes me feel like
a chicken with its head cut off.
Liz
1040161_7_a
Some are thoughtful enough to give
me the materials, but then some
forget I need the instructions...
Liz
1040161_6_a
Pretty busy, with all the people
asking me to make them the items
from that new collab quest.
Liz
1040161_5_a
How've things been lately?
Agil
1040161_4_a
Oh, hey, Agil!
Liz
1040161_3_a
Yo.
Agil
1040161_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Welcome!
Liz
1040161_1_a
Ha ha, yes, that's something I'll
have to consider. Thank you.
Rechka
1040138_35_a
Though it'd be good for brand
recognition, so...
Kirito
1040138_34_a
It might break peoples' immersion
if your store has the same name
in the real world and VR.
Kirito
1040138_33_a
I know it'll be your second store,
but you might think about changing
the name anyway.
Kirito
1040138_32_a
so I might go it alone for now.
Rechka
1040138_31_a
Ha ha, thanks. I figure it'll be
easier to open a store in VR than
it is in real life,
Rechka
1040138_30_a
Ooh, that's so exciting! Let me
know if there's anything I can
do to help!
Asuna
1040138_29_a
I want to open a branch of my shop
in VR.
Rechka
1040138_28_a
Good question. I think I'd like to
do something I never got around
to in SAO.
Rechka
1040138_27_a
So what will you do now that your
shop is open?
Kirito
1040138_26_a
Meeting you and Sasha gave me the
kick in the pants I needed to
start my own business.
Rechka
1040138_25_a
Kirito
1040138_24_a
Rechka
1040138_23_a
bg_04_inn_restaurant
Wow...
Asuna
1040138_22_a
Absolutely!
Sasha
1040138_21_a
Precisely. So if we ever get to
log out of here, I expect to see you
all at my shop!
Rechka
1040138_20_a
That'll give you reason enough to
survive.
Sasha
1040138_19_a
Ah, I see. Maybe that's for the
best.
Sasha
1040138_18_a
But I think I want my flagship
location to exist in the real
world.
Rechka
1040138_17_a
You know, I've thought about that.
Rechka
1040138_16_a
But with skills like yours, surely
you could open a restaurant
here in SAO or something?
Sasha
1040138_15_a
Oh, no, it's not like that.
I'm glad you understand, though.
Rechka
1040138_14_a
Ah, I see. I'm sorry to have held
you up on your journey.
Sasha
1040138_13_a
as I can until this death game
is over, and I can't do that if
I stay here.
Rechka
1040138_12_a
All I mean to say is that I want
to cook for as many people
Rechka
1040138_11_a
No, it's just... Well...
Sasha
1040138_10_a
Ha ha! Sorry, I've confused you,
haven't I?
Rechka
1040138_9_a
Um...?
Sasha
1040138_8_a
Food will move me forward!
Rechka
1040138_7_a
I want to spread that joy to as
many people as possible.
I'm done looking back.
Rechka
1040138_6_a
Looking at the children's faces
has really shown me the true power
of providing a meal for someone.
Rechka
1040138_5_a
Don't get me wrong. I would love
to ride out this death game with
all of you.
Rechka
1040138_4_a
But...!
Sasha
1040138_3_a
Sasha
1040138_2_a
bg_12_church_lounge
I'm terribly sorry, but I can't
do that.
Rechka
1040138_1_a
...
Rechka
1040137_21_a
and they've really taken to you
in a such a short period of time.
Sasha
1040137_20_a
The children love your cooking,
Sasha
1040137_19_a
Really? I...
Rechka
1040137_18_a
Would you mind staying on to look
after the children?
Sasha
1040137_17_a
No, I'm not. Why?
Rechka
1040137_16_a
You're not part of the Assault
Team, are you?
Sasha
1040137_15_a
You seem to be quite powerful,
Rechka.
Sasha
1040137_14_a
Sasha...?
Rechka
1040137_13_a
They're so honest. If they eat
something tasty, you can see
it on their faces.
Sasha
1040137_12_a
Me too. This is the first time
I've ever seen them smile like
this.
Sasha
1040137_11_a
Ha ha, don't worry about it,
Sasha. I love their innocent
little faces too much to be hurt.
Rechka
1040137_10_a
Hey! I told you to cut that out!
Sasha
1040137_9_a
Sorry about that, Rechka.
Sasha
1040137_8_a
That's so many!
I don't EVER want to be twenties!
Child
1040137_7_a
Twenties! She
she's twenties!
Child
1040137_6_a
Hey! I'm still in my twenties!
I'm not THAT old!
Rechka
1040137_5_a
Thank you, Ms. Rechka!
What a nice old lady!
Child
1040137_4_a
Sasha
1040137_3_a
Rechka
1040137_2_a
bg_12_church_lounge
Thank you, Ms. Rechka!
That was yummy!
Child
1040137_1_a
Oh?
Asuna
1040135_27_a
Anyway, I talked to Sasha after
we finished eating.
Rechka
1040135_26_a
Very true.
Kirito
1040135_25_a
Well, you don't see many of them
here in VR.
Asuna
1040135_24_a
Especially children's faces.
Their smiles are magical.
Rechka
1040135_23_a
There's nothing quite like seeing
the joy on someone's face after
you've served them a meal.
Rechka
1040135_22_a
And the smiles on their faces
lifted me up, as well.
Rechka
1040135_21_a
That they did.
Rechka
1040135_20_a
Ha ha, the kids must have loved
your cooking.
Kirito
1040135_19_a
That's great!
Asuna
1040135_18_a
I was put in charge of cooking
for the children.
Rechka
1040135_17_a
though I couldn't help but feel
that everyone was just trying to
hide their fear and unease...
Rechka
1040135_16_a
Sasha had kept their spirits up,
Rechka
1040135_15_a
There were two of them, actually.
And there were nearly twenty
in the church when I arrived.
Rechka
1040135_14_a
Yeah. I'm glad that ended well.
Asuna
1040135_13_a
I'm not surprised.
The town was pretty large.
Kirito
1040135_12_a
The poor babe got lost and
couldn't find the way back to
the church.
Rechka
1040135_11_a
Yeah, and in almost no time too,
once we both started searching
the town.
Rechka
1040135_10_a
Did you find the missing child?
Kirito
1040135_9_a
I think you're right. It'd been
about a year and a half or so
when I met her.
Rechka
1040135_8_a
It sounds like you met her before
we did, though.
Asuna
1040135_7_a
Indeed!
Asuna
1040135_6_a
Oh, so you two know her!
What a small world.
Rechka
1040135_5_a
The same Sasha that we met when we
were with Yui? She wears glasses,
right?
Asuna
1040135_4_a
Rechka
1040135_3_a
Asuna
1040135_2_a
bg_04_inn_restaurant
Wait, Sasha?
Kirito
1040135_1_a
Sasha.
Sasha
1040133_20_a
The name's Rechka. And you are?
Rechka
1040133_19_a
Th-Thank you so, so much!
I know we've only just met, but I
am so glad to hear you say that.
???
1040133_18_a
I was sent here to help you.
I can feel it. I am at your
service.
Rechka
1040133_17_a
Ah, no, it's not so bad...
???
1040133_16_a
Kind souls like yours don't
readily adapt to places like this.
It must be hard on you.
Rechka
1040133_15_a
That's no small feat. I've heard
about your efforts, believe it
or not.
Rechka
1040133_14_a
I'm doing my best to gather them
into the nearby church for
protection.
???
1040133_13_a
Yes, there are a number of
children who dived in for one
reason or another.
???
1040133_12_a
There are small children in a
place like this...?
Rechka
1040133_11_a
Oh, um, yes. We're both players.
???
1040133_10_a
Is this child also a player?
Rechka
1040133_9_a
A child? No...
Say, you're a player, aren't you?
Rechka
1040133_8_a
Rechka
1040133_7_a
You haven't seen a child of about
ten years old running around
here, have you?
???
1040133_6_a
Hm? What do you want?
Rechka
1040133_5_a
Pardon me...
???
1040133_4_a
Now now, Rechka. Focus.
You've got shopping to do!
Rechka
1040133_3_a
It seems...emptier than I recall.
Where is everyone?
Rechka
1040133_2_a
bg_11_starting_city
Well, I haven't been here in a
while...
Rechka
1040133_1_a
I'd be glad to.
Rechka
1040131_38_a
Leafa
1040131_37_a
Kirito
1040131_36_a
Would you mind sharing the whole
story with us?
Asuna
1040131_35_a
Well, meeting Asuna certainly
inspired me, but that's not the
whole story.
Rechka
1040131_34_a
Leafa
1040131_33_a
Asuna
1040131_32_a
What made you decide to open one
after you got out?
Kirito
1040131_31_a
No, I didn't.
Rechka
1040131_30_a
You didn't have a shop while you
were in SAO, did you?
Kirito
1040131_29_a
Stop by anytime you like.
Rechka
1040131_28_a
Leafa
1040131_27_a
Kirito
1040131_26_a
I'd love to try your cooking in
the real world someday.
Asuna
1040131_25_a
Leafa
1040131_24_a
Kirito
1040131_23_a
Thanks so much, Rechka!
Asuna
1040131_22_a
Oh, don't be silly! I invited you!
Rechka
1040131_21_a
Leafa
1040131_20_a
Kirito
1040131_19_a
Sorry to come barging in here with
all these hungry mouths. I hope
we're not too much trouble.
Asuna
1040131_18_a
Hahaha, she's fine!
Please, enjoy yourselves.
Rechka
1040131_17_a
Leafa
1040131_16_a
Asuna
1040131_15_a
Hey, Sug
er, Leafa!
Don't be rude!
Kirito
1040131_14_a
Asuna
1040131_13_a
Kirito
1040131_12_a
Well, I'll dig in if no one else
will!
Leafa
1040131_11_a
I can still put my professional
skills to work here just as well.
Rechka
1040131_10_a
Hah! I have a shop in the real
world, dear. This is nothing.
Rechka
1040131_9_a
Leafa
1040131_8_a
Asuna
1040131_7_a
Still, making all of this had to
take a fair amount of work!
Kirito
1040131_6_a
I sure did! But remember, virtual
cooking is a cinch compared to
the real thing.
Rechka
1040131_5_a
Leafa
1040131_4_a
Kirito
1040131_3_a
Wow, this is an incredible spread!
You made all of this?
Asuna
1040131_2_a
bg_04_inn_restaurant
Go on, eat up!
Rechka
1040131_1_a
Yeah, something like that.
Lisbeth
1040128_25_a
So you like working?
Kirito
1040128_24_a
But I'll spend it all eventually.
This isn't the worst way to make
some money every now and then.
Lisbeth
1040128_23_a
Yeah, for now.
Lisbeth
1040128_22_a
So, are you earning enough cash?
Kirito
1040128_21_a
Alright, alright, ya done yet?
Lisbeth
1040128_20_a
We're bound by the unbreakable
thread of fate that binds all
SAO survivors together!
Asuna
1040128_19_a
Hehe, yeah.
Asuna
1040128_18_a
Ha ha, it must have been
preordained!
Kirito
1040128_17_a
sigh
This is why I kept my trap
shut...
Lisbeth
1040128_16_a
Of course we'd come see you!
Asuna
1040128_15_a
Well, duh!
Kirito
1040128_14_a
I knew you'd come see me just to
poke fun if I told you what
job I landed...
Lisbeth
1040128_13_a
Cut it ooout! Quit talking about
me like some animal in a nature
documentary!
Lisbeth
1040128_12_a
That smile and that voice are
indicative qualities of the
enterprising Lizbethus Smithius--
Kirito
1040128_11_a
Then we got close enough to hear
you talking, so we knew there
could be no mistake!
Asuna
1040128_10_a
I thought my eyes were playing
tricks on me when I saw you in
that shrine maiden get-up.
Kirito
1040128_9_a
sigh
All the shrines in town and
you end up coming to the one
I work at...
Lisbeth
1040128_8_a
Pfft... S-Sorry...
Asuna
1040128_7_a
Says the girl laughing her butt
off at me!
Lisbeth
1040128_6_a
Hehe, come on, leave her be,
Kirito. The poor thing... Ha ha...
Asuna
1040128_5_a
Grrr...!
Lisbeth
1040128_4_a
Asuna
1040128_3_a
Lisbeth
1040128_2_a
bg_21_alne
Well now, THERE'S a sight!
Kirito
1040128_1_a
Oh, right!
Kirito
1040127_18_a
Hurry up and log out!
Asuna
1040127_17_a
Ah! We're going to be late
meeting up with everyone!
Asuna
1040127_16_a
I have no idea...
Asuna
1040127_15_a
Y-Yeah... What kind of work could
she get at this time of year?
Convenience store clerk...?
Kirito
1040127_14_a
You know Liz better than that!
Asuna
1040127_13_a
K-Kirito! Quit jumping to
conclusions!
Asuna
1040127_12_a
Why would she be...? Wait, is it
one of THOSE kinds of jobs?!
Kirito
1040127_11_a
Um... Well, she wouldn't tell me.
She seemed kind of embarrassed.
Asuna
1040127_10_a
What kind of work is it?
Kirito
1040127_9_a
A job?!
That's right, we did kind of
talk about that earlier...
Kirito
1040127_8_a
Well, it actually sounds like
she got a job.
Asuna
1040127_7_a
Everyone has their own stuff going
on around New Year's, I guess.
Kirito
1040127_6_a
That's too bad. I really wanted to
visit the shrine with everyone...
Oh, well...
Kirito
1040127_5_a
Oh, hey! That reminds me. Liz said
she can't make it after all.
Asuna
1040127_4_a
Yeah, I'll catch up with you in
the real world.
Kirito
1040127_3_a
Kirito
1040127_2_a
bg_21_alne
See you later, Kirito!
Asuna
1040127_1_a
I will.
Lisbeth
1040125_23_a
I can understand that... Well, let
me know if you change your mind.
Kirito
1040125_22_a
I get enough game-time here as it
is, so maybe I ought to go for
something more "real life"-y.
Lisbeth
1040125_21_a
Not that I'm not grateful,
but I don't think I am.
Lisbeth
1040125_20_a
So you interested in that job,
then?
Kirito
1040125_19_a
Even though it's only been two
years, the specs have totally
changed. I need to upgrade ASAP.
Lisbeth
1040125_18_a
I haven't changed my rig at all
since SAO...
Lisbeth
1040125_17_a
Truer words, man.
Kirito
1040125_16_a
Ha ha, yeah. You really can't
avoid dropping a lot of dough on
good tech if you're into VRMMOs.
Agil
1040125_15_a
and maybe upgrade my PC...
Lisbeth
1040125_14_a
Oh, a lot of things. I wanna hang
out with Asuna and Silica in
real life more...
Lisbeth
1040125_13_a
Well, what is it that you want
money for, anyway?
Kirito
1040125_12_a
Hmmm... I dunno...

where you test out experimental
VRMMOs. It's totally secure, so
there's nothing to worry about.
Kirito
1040125_10_a
C-Come on, guys! You're missing
the point! The job I got is one...
Kirito
1040125_9_a
Same here.
Agil
1040125_8_a
Hearing you say it like that kind
of makes me wanna strangle you.
Lisbeth
1040125_7_a
So I've got a bit of work right
now using those skills...
Kirito
1040125_6_a
Connections is going a bit
far... Look, I'm pretty decent
with games, right?
Kirito
1040125_5_a
Seriously?! You got connections
or something?!
Lisbeth
1040125_4_a
Agil
1040125_3_a
Lisbeth
1040125_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
So back to our original topic,
I could probably hook you up
with a job if you wanted.
Kirito
1040125_1_a
Hahaha, that's for sure.
Man, what a relief.
Agil
1040123_27_a
Ha ha... You're one tough cookie,
Liz.
Kirito
1040123_26_a
My worries are a little less
complex than that!
Lisbeth
1040123_25_a
arm's length just for being a
survivor, that just shows the kind
of people they are.
Lisbeth
1040123_24_a
Hahaha, I don't care if I'm all
that close or not with my family.
If they're gonna keep me at...
Lisbeth
1040123_23_a
Ah, yeah, okay...
Kirito
1040123_22_a
It wasn't family drama but money
troubles getting me down!
Lisbeth
1040123_21_a
D-Don't misunderstand!
I already told you.
Lisbeth
1040123_20_a
So that's what was bugging you,
Liz?
Kirito
1040123_19_a
Yeah...
Lisbeth
1040123_18_a
Maybe it's always going to be a
bit of a sore spot...
Kirito
1040123_17_a
C-Calm down, Agil... But I guess
we'll be carrying that stigma with
us the rest of our lives.
Kirito
1040123_16_a
Even so, that's no way to treat
someone who's been through
something so horrible!
Agil
1040123_15_a
It's not that big of a deal. It's
just that ever since then, we
haven't been as close...
Lisbeth
1040123_14_a
You don't need to get so worked up
over it, Agil.
Lisbeth
1040123_13_a
You're an SAO survivor! The world
chewed you up and spit you out!
And now they're ignoring you?!
Agil
1040123_12_a
What the hell, man?!
Agil
1040123_11_a
Huh...?
Kirito
1040123_10_a
But it's like my family's been
avoiding me or something...
Lisbeth
1040123_9_a
Beats me.
Lisbeth
1040123_8_a
Why's that?
Kirito
1040123_7_a
But this year, I hardly got any
at all...
Lisbeth
1040123_6_a
Bingo. Now normally I'm swimming
in those things...
Lisbeth
1040123_5_a
Um... Gifts from relatives?
Kirito
1040123_4_a
Agil
1040123_3_a
Kirito
1040123_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
So, what's a kid's major source of
income around this time of year?
Lisbeth
1040123_1_a
Yeah...?
Kirito
1040121_27_a
I doubt it, but...
Listen...
Lisbeth
1040121_26_a
C-Come on, maybe I can help...
Kirito
1040121_25_a
For mind-your-own-business,
that's what it's for.
Lisbeth
1040121_24_a
What is it you need money for?
Kirito
1040121_23_a
sigh
... Maybe I should look for
part-time work...
Lisbeth
1040121_22_a
Now there's a real life problem
if I've ever heard one.
Agil
1040121_21_a
M-Money?
Kirito
1040121_20_a
It's money!
Cold, hard, CASH!
Lisbeth
1040121_19_a
You can talk to me if you feel up
to it.
Kirito
1040121_18_a
Maybe there's nothing we can do,
but you might feel better getting
it off your chest.
Kirito
1040121_17_a
Eh, I guess...
Lisbeth
1040121_16_a
Lisbeth
1040121_15_a
Agil
1040121_14_a
Is there something bothering you,
Liz? Something in real life?
Kirito
1040121_13_a
I can hear EVERYTHING.
Lisbeth
1040121_12_a
If you two are gonna whisper about
me, at least do it quietly!
Lisbeth
1040121_11_a
Real life, huh...?
Kirito
1040121_9_a
Agil
1040121_10_a
Something from real life bothering
her, I think. I didn't ask for
details though...
Agil
1040121_8_a
Hey, Agil, what's up with Liz?
She's been sighing like that
for hours...
Kirito
1040121_7_a
Kirito
1040121_6_a
...
Agil
1040121_5_a
sigh

がんばってね、リズ!
アスナ
1040118_23_a
今回のイベントで再確認できた
ことを、明日から鍛冶職人としても
また活かしていきたいわ
1040118_22_a
ふふっ、
そんな大層なもんじゃないけどね
1040118_21_a
おおっ、さすがはリズ……
なんかクリエイターって
感じがするよ
アスナ
1040118_20_a
すごく嬉しいことなんだって、
再確認できて良かったわ
1040118_19_a
ええ、そうね
暇つぶしにもなったし、やっぱり
物を作って喜んでもらうのって……
1040118_18_a
ふふっ、良かったね
これでクエスト達成だね
アスナ
1040118_17_a
ええ、さようなら
また来てね
1040118_16_a
じゃあ武器屋さん、またね!
1040118_15_a
あはは、NPCのこの子には
ちょっと難しい話だったかしら?
1040118_14_a
……?
1040118_13_a
今日は12月25日……
確かにそうなるわね
1040118_12_a
そう言えば妹さんは
イエス・キリストと同じ日生まれって
ことになるんだね……
アスナ
1040118_11_a
そうだね
アスナ
1040118_10_a
それにしても、
誕生日に間に合って良かったわね
1040118_9_a
ありがたくいただくわ
1040118_8_a
もちろんよ
このお金にはあなたの大事な気持ちが
こもっているもの
1040118_7_a
これが代金の5コルです
これで足りますか?
1040118_6_a
ふふっ、どういたしまして
1040118_5_a
これで妹もきっと喜んでくれるわ!
1040118_4_a
アスナ
1040118_3_a
1040118_2_a
bg_07_lisbeth_smith
武器屋さん!
ありがとう!
1040118_1_a
うん、そうだね
アスナ
1040117_28_a
リソースが回復してわんさか
敵が出てくる前に、
さっさと退散しちゃいましょう
1040117_27_a
誰なのよ……って詮索しても
意味ないか
1040117_26_a
多分ね……
アスナ
1040117_25_a
つまりあたし達が来る前に
誰かがここで戦ってたってこと?
1040117_24_a
直前で狩りが
行われていたってことだよ
アスナ
1040117_23_a
ううん、この不自然なほど
モンスターがPOPしない
この感じは……
アスナ
1040117_22_a
デマだったとか?
1040117_21_a
強いフラグMobどころか、
ほとんどモンスターが
POPしなかったね
アスナ
1040117_20_a
噂のことだよね
うん、わたしも思った
アスナ
1040117_19_a
でも……ちょっと変よね
1040117_18_a
うん、良かったね!
アスナ
1040117_17_a
やったわ!
これで最後の素材も無事ゲットよ!
1040117_16_a
そうなんだ……
うん、了解だよ
アスナ
1040117_15_a
危険な状況になったら、
すぐ転移結晶で逃げられるように
しておきましょう
1040117_14_a
それ以外の雑魚Mobも
結構強いらしいわ
1040117_13_a
なんかとんでもなく強い
フラグMobが出るんだって
1040117_12_a
さっき噂を聞いたの
この迷いの森とやらに
1040117_11_a
どうしたの?
アスナ
1040117_10_a
ええ、でもアスナ
ちょっと気をつけて
1040117_9_a
でも誕生日に間に合いそうで
良かったよね
さて、じゃあ早速素材を探そっか……
アスナ
1040117_8_a
そうね、結局素材全部集めるのが、
クリスマスシーズン
ギリギリになっちゃったわね～
1040117_7_a
1040117_6_a
bg_03_tree_snow
そう言えば今日が
クリスマスイヴなんだよね
アスナ
1040117_5_a
じゃあな
キリト
1040117_4_a
キリト
お前ェは……お前ェは生きろよ
……最後まで生きてくれ
クライン
1040117_3_a
キリト
1040117_2_a
bg_03_forest_snow
キリト……キリトよぉ
クライン
1040117_1_a
迷いの森ね、了解よ
1040115_16_a
ええとね
第35層の迷いの森ってところだよ
アスナ
1040115_15_a
さて、残り一つの木材は
どこにあるんだったかしら……?
1040115_14_a
まあこの世界の住人にクリスマスって
概念が存在するのかどうか
知らないけど
1040115_13_a
あはは、たしかにね
1040115_12_a
うん、ちゃんと渡せたら
クリスマスプレゼントって
ことになるのかな?
アスナ
1040115_11_a
そうなのね
でもこれであの子も無事に妹に
積み木を渡せそうで良かったわ
1040115_10_a
ううん、ちょうど今はKoBも
そんなに忙しくないし、大丈夫だよ
アスナ
1040115_9_a
これもアスナが手伝って
くれてるおかげよ
ありがとね
1040115_8_a
ええ、そうね
必要な素材もこれで残る一つだわ
1040115_7_a
でも木材集めは、
意外に簡単そうで良かったね
アスナ
1040115_6_a
よけーなご配慮要らないわよ
そんなことするくらいなら、さっさと
ログアウトさせてくれないかしら……
1040115_5_a
リズがあまりにも暇だって
言ってたから、ゲームも気を利かして
くれたのかもよ、ふふっ
アスナ
1040115_4_a
鍛冶職人限定の
木製のおもちゃを作れだなんて
1040115_3_a
アスナ
1040115_2_a
bg_03_forest1_sunset
はぁ～
変わったクエストもあるのね
1040115_1_a
いくつかの木材と……
一定以上の熟練度の
鍛冶スキルだって!
1040113_30_a
どうしたの?
アスナ
1040113_29_a
ううん、どっかの露店で見かけて
閲覧履歴が残ってただけ
積み木の生成に必要なのは……えっ?
1040113_28_a
持ってるの?
アスナ
1040113_27_a
あっ……あったわ
1040113_26_a
積み木かぁ……
確か前にアイテムリストで
見かけたことがあるような……
1040113_25_a
木のおもちゃ……
積み木とかかな?
アスナ
1040113_24_a
妹は……木のおもちゃが
好きなんです!
1040113_23_a
ちなみにどんな物を作ってほしいの?
1040113_22_a
でもまぁ……いきなり断るのは、
あまりにも可哀想だし……
1040113_21_a
えと……ここは武器屋だから、
そもそも武器以外は
作れないんだけど……
1040113_20_a
5コル……だね
アスナ
1040113_19_a
あたしが今まで貯めたこのお金で……
なにか作ってくれませんか……?
1040113_18_a
でもうちはお金があんまりないので、
あまり高いプレゼントとか
買うことができなくて……
1040113_17_a
こんど五歳の誕生日が
近づいてるんです
1040113_16_a
あたしに四歳の妹が
いるんですけど……
1040113_15_a
え、ええ
どうしたの?
1040113_14_a
あたしのお願い、
聞いてくれませんか……?
1040113_13_a
あの……
武器屋さんにお願いするのは
変だと思うんですけど……
1040113_12_a
かもしれないね
アスナ
1040113_11_a
じゃあクエストが発生したってこと?
1040113_10_a
リズ、この女の子NPCみたいだよ
アスナ
1040113_9_a
そ、そうだけど……
1040113_8_a
あの……
ここは武器屋さんですか?
1040113_7_a
えっ?
い、いらっしゃい!
あらっ……えっ、女の子?
1040113_6_a
リ、リズ
誰かお客さんだよ!
アスナ
1040113_5_a
……はぁ
ホントに暇ねぇ

bg_07_lisbeth_smith_sunset
あ、あの……
???
1040113_1_a
あはは……
アスナ
1040111_28_a
今は暇だけどね……
1040111_27_a
あたしは当分この店を切り盛りする
だけで精一杯よ
1040111_26_a
あたし?
ぜーんぜん、いないわよ
1040111_25_a
リズにも気になる人とかいないの?
アスナ
1040111_24_a
ふーん、そうなんだ
1040111_23_a
そ、そんな……
で、でも最近あの人とは
連絡取ってないし……
アスナ
1040111_22_a
せっかくリア充たちが人目も気にせず
イチャつける時期なんだから、
進展させるいいチャンスじゃない?
1040111_21_a
とぼけるんじゃないわよ
よくあんたの話題に出てくる
彼の話よ
1040111_20_a
へっ……な、なんのこと?
アスナ
1040111_19_a
そう言えばアスナあんた
お目当ての剣士とはその後どうなの?
1040111_18_a
………………
1040111_17_a
でも……こんなときだからこそ、
少しでも幸せを感じていたいっていう
気持ちはわかるけどな……
アスナ
1040111_16_a
ったく……
そんな状況じゃないでしょうに
1040111_15_a
あはは……確かに町中歩いてると、
友人や恋人同士でクリスマスを
満喫してる人をよく見かけるね
アスナ
1040111_14_a
こんなのが続くようじゃ
武器屋の商売上がったりだわ～
1040111_13_a
まぁせめてこんな時期くらい、
命の危険晒して外でバトルなんて
やりたくないって気持ちはわかるけど
1040111_12_a
ああ……
アスナ
1040111_11_a
どうもクリスマスが近づいてるせいで
プレイヤー達が街にこもってる
みたいなのよね
1040111_10_a
確かになんかお客さん少ないね
アスナ
1040111_9_a
ううん
いや、最近暇だなあと思って……
1040111_8_a
それよりも溜息ばかりついて、
もしかして……どこか調子悪いの?
アスナ
1040111_7_a
あっ、アスナいらっしゃい
1040111_6_a
ちょっとリズ……どうしたの?
アスナ
1040111_5_a
ハァ……
1040111_4_a
うーん……

ふふっ、ありがとう!
1040098_27_a
はい、リズさんだからこそ、
手に入れられたんだと思います!
シリカ
1040098_26_a
ううん、そんなことないと思うよ
素材を熟知してるリズだからこそ、
気づけたことだもん
アスナ
1040098_25_a
あはは、ラッキーだったわ
1040098_24_a
ありがとう、二人とも……
まさかもらえるなんて
思わなかったけど……

おめでとうございます、リズさん!
シリカ
1040098_22_a
そうなんだ、良かったね!
アスナ
1040098_21_a
リトル・ビーを守ったことが
成功条件になってたみたいね……
1040098_20_a
わっ……やったわ!
新しい装備をゲットしちゃった!
1040098_19_a
クエスト……ですか?
シリカ
1040098_18_a
えっ?
これってクエストだったの!?
1040098_17_a
急にインフォメーションが
表示されて……
1040098_16_a
リズ、どうしたの?
アスナ
1040098_15_a
あら……?
何かしら……?
1040098_14_a
そうね
シリカお願いするわね……
1040098_13_a
確かにその方が効率的だと思います
ケットシー専用のBBSにも
書いておきます!
シリカ
1040098_12_a
大勢で監視するってことですね!
シリカ
1040098_11_a
捕食モンスターもあんまり
増えないと思うよ
アスナ
1040098_10_a
花が枯れちゃうのはみんな困るだろうし
みんなで定期的に討伐しておけば、
アスナ
1040098_9_a
とりあえずこの情報を他の
プレイヤーにも広めておけば
いいんじゃないかな?
アスナ
1040098_8_a
た、確かに……
シリカ
1040098_7_a
うーん、でも今の爬虫類型のMobが
追加量産されないとも限らないわよね
1040098_6_a
良かったですね!
これで受粉してくれれば、
花園が無くなることはなさそうですね
シリカ
1040098_5_a
ええ、リトル・ビー達も
ほとんど食べられることなく、
終わらせられたわ
1040098_4_a
シリカ
1040098_3_a
1040098_2_a
bg_04_field_flower_night
これで爬虫類モンスターは
全部倒したね
アスナ
1040098_1_a
なるほど……土の中に隠れてたのね!
捕食モンスター!
さあ、出てきなさい!
1040097_25_a
あっ、あっちを見てください!
今度は土が突然せり上がってきました!
シリカ
1040097_24_a
きゅるるっ!
1040097_23_a
あとはリトル・ビーに誘われて、
ハチを捕食するモンスターが
登場すれば……
アスナ
1040097_22_a
やったね、
これで第一段階はクリアだね!
アスナ
1040097_21_a
現れた……!
あれがリトル・ビーよ!
1040097_20_a
あれは……!
新たなMobがPOPする
エフェクト……!
アスナ
1040097_19_a
見てください、
ピナの示してる方向に……!
シリカ
1040097_18_a
えっ……あっ!
アスナさん、リズさん!
シリカ
1040097_17_a
きゅきゅー!
1040097_16_a
ピナ……どうしたの?
静かにしてないとダメだよ
シリカ
1040097_15_a
アスナ

きゅいきゅい!

1040097_11_a
そうね、
しばらく待ってみましょうか……
1040097_10_a
まずリトル・ビーが登場するかどうか
ですよね?
シリカ
1040097_9_a
1040097_8_a
このタイミングを狙って、
出てくるってことだよね?
アスナ
1040097_7_a
もしハチを食べるモンスターがいるなら
追加のハチが実装された
アスナ
1040097_6_a
どうだろうね……
確かに日付変更の際にリソース周りが
リセットされることはよくあるけど……
アスナ
1040097_5_a
そうね
昼に来たときと雰囲気が違うわね
さて……塩梅はどんなもんかしら……?
1040097_4_a

bg_04_field_flower_night
夜の花園……
なんだか幻想的ですね
シリカ
1040097_1_a
ありえるわね……
1040095_24_a
ハチを食べるモンスターがいるって
ことですか?
シリカ
1040095_23_a
ハチを生命活動の
糧にしてるMobがいる……とか?
アスナ
1040095_22_a
受粉によって、花々の生命活動が
支えられているように、
アスナ
1040095_21_a
そ、それは困ります!
シリカ
1040095_20_a
このままだとこの花園……
近い将来枯れた荒れ地に
なっちゃうわよ……
1040095_19_a
でもさっきからポリネーターとして
重要な役目を持つリトル・ビーを
一匹も見かけないのよ……
1040095_18_a
へぇぇ……知りませんでした
シリカ
1040095_17_a
ええ、そうよ
1040095_16_a
なるほど
現実の自然界の作りと同じなんだね
アスナ
1040095_15_a
新規エリアで採集しに来るプレイヤーが
多い場所には、応急処置として、
そういう循環機能も用意されてるのよ
1040095_14_a
自動でもある程度復活は
するんだけど……
1040095_13_a
も、もちろんこれはゲームの中だから、
リソースの問題さえなければ、
1040095_12_a
ええっ!?
シリカ
1040095_11_a
花粉が運ばれなくなって……
花が育たなくなるわ
1040095_10_a
そのリトル・ビーがいないと
どうなるの?
アスナ
1040095_9_a
あはは、そんな怖がるほどじゃないわよ
現実で言うところのミツバチ……
よりも大人しい感じだから
1040095_8_a
は、ハチですか!?
シリカ
1040095_7_a
ハチの姿のモンスターが
いるはずなんだけど……
1040095_6_a
ええ、こんな感じの花畑だと、
普通は《リトル・ビー》っていう
1040095_5_a
花粉を……運ぶ……
アスナ
1040095_4_a
シリカ
1040095_3_a
アスナ
1040095_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
ポリネーターってのは、送粉者
つまり花粉を運ぶ小動物のこと
1040095_1_a
ポリネーター?
アスナ
1040093_20_a
いえ、素材は全部あったんだけど……
《ポリネーター》がいないなって……
1040093_19_a
見当たらない……って言ってたって
ことは、何かお目当ての植物素材が
なかったんですか?
シリカ
1040093_18_a
えと……
1040093_17_a
リズ、何かあったの?
アスナ
1040093_16_a
この種類の花が
これだけ咲いてるのに……
全然見当たらない……
1040093_15_a
あれ……おかしいわね
1040093_14_a
アスナ
1040093_13_a
なるほど
SAOとはその辺の事情が違うんですね
シリカ
1040093_12_a
その場合は植物系の素材が
多用されるみたいだよ
アスナ
1040093_11_a
特にこのALOは
武器や防具にも魔法属性の要素が
あるからね
アスナ
1040093_10_a
確かにそう思い込みがちだけど、
違うみたいだね
アスナ
1040093_9_a
そういうのを素材として集める
印象があったんですけど……
植物もちゃんと素材になるんですね
シリカ
1040093_8_a
でもあたし……武器職人って言うと、
どちらかと言うと鉄とか鉱物とか……
あとは軽装防具だと動物の皮とか……
シリカ
1040093_7_a
そうだね
まさに職人の顔って感じだね
アスナ
1040093_6_a
はい、でもとっても嬉しそうです
充実してるって感じがします
シリカ
1040093_5_a
シリカ
1040093_4_a
ふふっ、リズ……
すごく真剣な顔してるね……
アスナ
1040093_3_a
あっ、こっちの花から採れる蜜……
属性強化の素材になるはずよ
1040093_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
この草は……
法衣の魔法防御上げに使えそうね……
1040093_1_a
はーい!
シリカ
1040091_15_a
はーい
アスナ
1040091_14_a
もーっ、揚げ足取りはいいから!
さっさと行きましょう!
1040091_13_a
ふふふっ、確かに!
シリカ
1040091_12_a
ふふっ、リズったら力こぶを見せつける
みたいなそのポーズだと、まるで
筋力値で何かするみたいだよ
アスナ
1040091_11_a
あたしのこの腕でね!
1040091_10_a
はいはい
全員にちゃんとお礼はするわよ!
1040091_9_a
あ、あたしは別に……
それを言うなら許可をくれた
アリシャさんに……
シリカ
1040091_8_a
わたしよりも他の種族が
この領内に来る許可を取ってくれた
シリカちゃんにお礼を言ってあげて
アスナ
1040091_7_a
ええ、教えてくれてありがとう
アスナ
1040091_6_a
ここは植物系の新しい素材が
沢山あるから、リズも喜ぶかと
思って
アスナ
1040091_5_a
はい!
シリカ
1040091_4_a
アスナ
1040091_3_a
シリカ
1040091_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
おおっ!
ここがケットシー領にできた
新エリアねー!
1040091_1_a
やったー!
楽しみー!
ストレア
1040078_25_a
うん、そうだね!
リーファ
1040078_24_a
ふふっ
今度はアスナさんたちも
誘いましょうよ
シリカ
1040078_23_a
女子だけの、
かしましサウナ会ってやつをね
1040078_22_a
ううん、別になんてことないわよ
これからも機会があれば、
また行きましょう
1040078_21_a
でも今日はホント楽しかったよー
3人ともアタシに付き合ってくれて、
ありがとね～
ストレア
1040078_20_a
ドキドキ……
シリカ
1040078_19_a
あはは……
リーファ
1040078_18_a
はぁはぁ……
び、ビックリしたぁ……
1040078_17_a
あはは～
3人が勝手に言っただけでしょ～?
ストレア
1040078_16_a
ってストレア!
なに言わせんのよーー!!
1040078_15_a
そうですね……
シリカ
1040078_14_a
ですね……
リーファ
1040078_13_a
あたしもあいつなら別に……
1040078_12_a
アタシは別にキリトだったら
構わないけどねー
ストレア
1040078_11_a
はい、ホントの覗きだったら、
そうも言ってられませんけどね
リーファ
1040078_10_a
一瞬びっくりしちゃったけど、
こういうのも面白いわよね
1040078_9_a
ふふっ
女性限定パーティだからこその
クエストって感じよね
1040078_8_a
消えちゃいましたね……
やっぱりNPCだったんですね
シリカ
1040078_7_a
………………
NPC
1040078_6_a
わかればよろしい!
ストレア
1040078_5_a
1040078_4_a
シリカ
1040078_3_a
ストレア
1040078_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
す、すみません……
もうしません……
NPC
1040078_1_a
おっけ～!
ストレア
1040077_28_a
ふふっ、了解です!
リーファ
1040077_27_a
よーし!
サウナでさっぱりしたとこだし、
派手にやっちゃいましょう!
1040077_26_a
あはは、確かに……
シリカ
1040077_25_a
覗いた相手を
遠慮なくやれるってことでしょ?
なかなか気が利いてていいじゃない!
1040077_24_a
ふふっ、なるほど
クエストの一環ってことね
1040077_23_a
ほっ……なんか安心しちゃいました
プレイヤーさんだったら、
すごく気持ち悪いですもんね
シリカ
1040077_22_a
な、なんだぁ……
リーファ
1040077_21_a
卑劣な男という設定の……
敵NPCってこと?
リーファ
1040077_20_a
NPC!?
ってことは……女性プレイヤーの
サウナしてる姿を覗こうとした……
リーファ
1040077_19_a
一応言っておこうと思ってさー
ストレア
1040077_18_a
今逃げた人たちって
プレイヤーじゃなくてNPCだよー
ストレア
1040077_17_a
ストレアさん!?
い、今は急がないと……
シリカ
1040077_16_a
あーっ、ちょっと待ってー
ストレア
1040077_15_a
お、追いかけましょう!
とっちめてやるんだから!
リーファ
1040077_14_a
ああっ、逃げたわよ!
1040077_13_a
チッ……!
???
1040077_12_a
の、覗き魔!?
リーファ
1040077_11_a
ええっ!?
も、もしかして……
シリカ
1040077_10_a
あの岩の陰に誰かいる!
ストレア
1040077_9_a
ストレア、どうしたの!?
1040077_8_a
……あっ!!
ストレア
1040077_7_a
そうだねー
ストレア
1040077_6_a
ふふっ
じゃあそろそろ着替えて、
戻ろっか!
リーファ
1040077_5_a
はい!
仮想世界の中ですけど、
なんかさっぱりした気がします!
シリカ
1040077_4_a
ストレア
1040077_3_a
シリカ
1040077_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
ふぅ……
でもいい汗かいたわね
1040077_1_a
リ、リズさんまで
ジロジロ見ながら言うの、
止めてくださーい!
リーファ
1040075_19_a
言われてみると、
あたしらのメンバーのナンバー
ワンツーが今ここにいるのよねぇ……
1040075_18_a
ですね……
シリカ
1040075_17_a
ぐっ……
悔しいけどなにも言えない……
1040075_16_a
キリトも好きって言ってくれる
かなぁ～!
ストレア
1040075_15_a
だったらー
ストレアは一番モテモテって
ことだよね～?
ストレア
1040075_14_a
話ちゃんと聞いてなさいよ……
男性陣の好みの話でしょ?
1040075_13_a
えっ、なになに?
シリカはおっぱい大きい方が
好きなのー?
ストレア
1040075_12_a
ちょ、シリカちゃん!?
目線を下にずらしながら言うの、
止めてよ～!
リーファ
1040075_11_a
男の人もきっとリーファさんや
ストレアさんみたいな……
シリカ
1040075_10_a
でも女の子ってちょっとぽっちゃり
してるくらいがちょうどいいって
話も聞いたりしますよね……
シリカ
1040075_9_a
それは良くないですね……
シリカ
1040075_8_a
う、うん……最近また夜食に
手を伸ばし始めちゃって……
リーファ
1040075_7_a
リーファさん、痩せたいんですか?
シリカ
1040075_6_a
これくらいの時間、現実のサウナに
いたら、きっとホントに痩せられる
んだろうなぁ……
リーファ
1040075_5_a
そうですね……
シリカ
1040075_4_a
ストレア
1040075_3_a
シリカ
1040075_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
しっかし仮想世界でも
十分なくらい暑いなぁ……
リーファ
1040075_1_a
あはは……
そうかもしれませんね……
シリカ
1040073_21_a
ど、どうなのかしら……?
案外仮想世界の住人である
ストレアなら、効くのかしら……?
1040073_20_a
そ、そうね……
あたしたちに100％効果がないのは
わかってるけど、
1040073_19_a
ここで汗をかけば
美容と健康にいいんだよね～!
ストレア
1040073_18_a
ふふっ、一度でいいから
サウナってやつに
入ってみたかったんだ～!
ストレア
1040073_17_a
その場合ストレアが当てはまるのか
微妙なトコでしたからね……
リーファ
1040073_16_a
サラマンダー衣装の装備者が
パーティにいることが必要って
条件でしたけど……
リーファ
1040073_15_a
ですね、サラマンダー領の
このエリアに入るには
種族がサラマンダーであるか、
リーファ
1040073_14_a
まあシステム的には抜け道みたいな
もんだけど、無事来られて
良かったわよね
1040073_13_a
そ、そんなことないですよ
まだ我慢できますし、
た、楽しいです……
シリカ
1040073_12_a
ええっ、シリカ大丈夫?
今日は付き合わせちゃって、
悪かったかなぁ……
ストレア
1040073_11_a
リズさぁん!
あたし子供じゃないですぅ!
シリカ
1040073_10_a
子供はすぐにのぼせるって
言うからねぇ……
1040073_9_a
あたし結構苦手なんですぅ……
シリカ
1040073_8_a
あはは……
まさか仮想世界でサウナに
入ることになるなんて……
リーファ
1040073_7_a
火山地帯のマグマエリア付近!
サウナだ～～!!
ストレア
1040073_6_a
ですね……
まさに……
シリカ
1040073_5_a
確かに……
1040073_4_a
シリカ
1040073_3_a
ストレア
1040073_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
あ、暑い……
リーファ
1040073_1_a
ふふふっ、実はね～
ストレア
1040071_27_a
へぇ、どこなの?
1040071_26_a
それでアタシ、サラマンダーの装備が
着られたら、どうしても
行ってみたい場所があったんだ!
ストレア
1040071_25_a
うん、そーだよ～!
力が強くなったり、暑いエリアでの
耐久性が上がったりね～!
ストレア
1040071_24_a
でも確かその装備を着ることで、
サラマンダーとしてのステータスも
付加されるんですよね?
シリカ
1040071_23_a
あはは……
まさに特別待遇ってやつなんだ……
リーファ
1040071_22_a
そしたらねー、「キミのような
うるさいNPCは初めてだ!」って
笑いながら、この服くれたんだ～
ストレア
1040071_21_a
そ、そんなことをしちゃうとは……
さすがはストレアさん……
シリカ
1040071_20_a
ええっ!?
1040071_19_a
アタシも「サラマンダーの服を
着たいー!」って、
運営に直談判しに行ったんだ～!
ストレア
1040071_18_a
ふふっ、実はねー
みんながサラマンダーの服着て
遊んでて楽しそうだったから～
ストレア
1040071_17_a
あとはキリトさんのとこの
ユイちゃんくらいなんじゃ……
シリカ
1040071_16_a
うーん……
でもストレアさんクラスのNPCって
そんなにいないですよね?
シリカ
1040071_15_a
へぇ……今回のキャンペーンって
NPCも対象になってるんだぁ……
運営も手が込んでるというか……
リーファ
1040071_14_a
ああ、アタシのはステータス持ちの
NPCに限定して着られる
サラマンダー衣装ってだけだよ～
ストレア
1040071_13_a
でもあれ……?
ストレアさんはNPCだし……
シリカ
1040071_12_a
ストレアさんも応募に受かったって
ことですか……? 
シリカ
1040071_11_a
サラマンダーの装備を着て
限定クエに行ったって
言ってましたね
リーファ
1040071_10_a
そう言えば
アスナさんとシノンさんも
あのキャンペーンに受かって、
リーファ
1040071_9_a
その衣装……
そのときのアスナに
よく似てるとは思ったけど……
1040071_8_a
前にシリカと二人でサラマンダー・
キャンペーンに受かったアスナの
手伝いをしたのよ
1040071_7_a
うん、そーだよ～!
ストレア
1040071_6_a
ストレアさんの新装備……
サラマンダーですか?
シリカ
1040071_5_a
あっ……それって、
もしかして……?
1040071_4_a
シリカ
1040071_3_a
1040071_2_a
bg_21_alne
じゃっ、じゃーん!
ストレア
1040071_1_a
はい!
1040068_25_a
ね、ユイちゃん?
アスナ
1040068_24_a
そんなことないと思うけど……
そう言ってくれるのは、
すごく嬉しいかな
アスナ
1040068_23_a
ふふっ、だからこの装備を
ゲットできたのって
ユイちゃんやアスナのおかげかも!
ユウキ
1040068_22_a
ユウキさん……
1040068_21_a
NPCの命を最優先に考えて、
とっさに決断できたのかもね
ユウキ
1040068_20_a
ボクはこうしてアスナ達と仲良く
させてもらって……ユイちゃんとも
一緒に遊んでるから……
ユウキ
1040068_19_a
一秒を争う時間だからこそ、
なかなか難しい采配だよね……
アスナ
1040068_18_a
ふふっ
でも……そのクエストって
一瞬の判断が試されるんだね
アスナ
1040068_17_a
ああ……ようやく思い出したよ
だからどこかで見覚えがあるって
思ってたんだ
ユウキ
1040068_16_a
あの島で実装してた装備だけ、
後から別の場所で入手できるように
なるんじゃないかって思ってたの
アスナ
1040068_15_a
ええ、そうよ
恐らくこの装備のデザインは
あの島やラーンさんのと同じだわ
アスナ
1040068_14_a
閉鎖されちゃった
浦島太郎の島だよね……あっ!
ユウキ
1040068_13_a
前に行った南方の島が
あったでしょ?
アスナ
1040068_12_a
ん、どうしたの?
ユウキ
1040068_11_a
ああっ……!
やっぱり……!
アスナ
1040068_10_a
item_event_hagoromo_yuuki
うん、いいよ
えーと、これかな……
ユウキ
1040068_9_a
ねえユウキ
その装備ってどんなのか、
ちょっと見せてもらってもいい?
アスナ
1040068_8_a
発生するやつだったみたい
ユウキ
1040068_7_a
どうやらあの水辺で
一定時間以上泳いでると、
ユウキ
1040068_6_a
ふぅん……
じゃあそのNPCを助ける
クエストだったんだね
アスナ
1040068_5_a
うん、ユイちゃんありがとう
ユウキ
1040068_4_a
アスナ
1040068_3_a
ユウキ
1040068_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
どうぞ
ユウキさん、お茶ですよ
1040068_1_a
シウネー
1040067_25_a
シウネー……そっか
わかったよ
じゃあありがたくいただいておくね
ユウキ
1040067_24_a
だからこそクエストは
達成できたんですよ、きっと
シウネー
1040067_23_a
でもあなたは何よりも
そのNPCを助けることを
最優先に考えて急いで飛び出した
シウネー
1040067_22_a
NPCの安全よりも効率化を考えて、
そういう判断をしてしまったんです
シウネー
1040067_21_a
それはきっとどこかで……
これをただのゲームのクエストだと
思っていたから……
シウネー
1040067_20_a
私はさっき万全を期してあなたに
魔法をかけようとしました
シウネー
1040067_19_a
シウネー……?
ユウキ
1040067_18_a
もちろんですよ、だってそれは
あなたが持つべきものだから
シウネー
1040067_17_a
えっ?
でもシウネー……いいの?
ユウキ
1040067_16_a
それはユウキが持っていて
シウネー
1040067_15_a
あっ……それよりも
クエスト報酬が一着しかない!
どうしよっか……?
ユウキ
1040067_14_a
うーんと、なんだったかな……
ユウキ
1040067_13_a
どうしたの?
シウネー
1040067_12_a
ん……
これってどこかで見覚えが……?
ユウキ
1040067_11_a
本当ですね……
シウネー
1040067_10_a
これは……
わあ、なんか日本の昔話に出てくる
羽衣みたいだね
ユウキ
1040067_9_a
item_event_hagoromo_yuuki
あの……これはほんのお礼です
もし良ければお受け取りください
NPC
1040067_8_a
ふふっ、そうですね
あれだけ散々泳いでたのにね
シウネー
1040067_7_a
まさかあんなおっきなモンスターが
水中に潜んでたなんて
思わなかったよね
ユウキ
1040067_6_a
シウネーもフォローありがとね
ユウキ
1040067_5_a
ううん、無事で良かったよ
ユウキ
1040067_4_a
シウネー
1040067_3_a
ユウキ
1040067_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake_transport
助けていただき、
ありがとうございました……
NPC
1040067_1_a
ユウキ……わかったわ
私は地上からあなたを
しっかり援護してみせます!
シウネー
1040065_14_a
……!
シウネー
1040065_13_a
そんなんじゃ間に合わない!
ユウキ
1040065_12_a
ま、待ってユウキ!
今念のため水中呼吸魔法を……!
シウネー
1040065_11_a
シウネーは回り込んで
地上から援護お願い!
ユウキ
1040065_10_a
シウネー……
うん、わかった
じゃあ泳いで行くのはボクだね!
ユウキ
1040065_9_a
単純なトップスピードなら
あなたの方が上です……
シウネー
1040065_8_a
いいえ、ユウキ
確かに私の泳ぎの方が
型は綺麗ですが……
シウネー
1040065_7_a
い、急がなくちゃ……
シウネーがあそこまで泳いで、
ボクが地上から援護を……
ユウキ
1040065_6_a
あれは見たところNPC……
でも溺れてるんじゃなくて、
水中に引きずり込まれてる感じです!
シウネー
1040065_5_a
あ、あそこ!
誰かが溺れてる!?
ユウキ
1040065_4_a
シウネー
1040065_3_a
ユウキ
1040065_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
うぷっ
た、た、助け……てぇ!
???
1040065_1_a
行ってみよう!
ユウキ
1040063_26_a
この声……
水辺の向こう側から聞こえるわ!
シウネー
1040063_25_a
……!
ユウキ
1040063_24_a
た、助けてー!!!
???
1040063_23_a
うん!
全然大丈夫だよ!
ユウキ
1040063_22_a
ふふっ、あなた休憩って言いながら
ずっと泳いでましたけど、
もう平気なんですか?
シウネー
1040063_21_a
bg_13_coral_lake_transport
さてそろそろ休憩はおしまいかな
移動しよっか
ユウキ
1040063_20_a
bg_13_coral_lake_transport
シウネー
1040063_19_a
bg_13_coral_lake
そっか～
確かにアスナも泳ぐの上手だもんね
ユウキ
1040063_18_a
だから泳ぎもうまくなっておいた方が
なにかと役に立つんじゃないかって
思ったんです
シウネー
1040063_17_a

ウンディーネには水中戦の
プラス補正がつくでしょう?
シウネー
1040063_16_a
bg_13_coral_lake
えっ、そうなの?
いつの間に……!?
ユウキ
1040063_15_a
このALOに来てすぐの頃、
今のユウキと同じように
練習したんですよ
シウネー
1040063_14_a
bg_13_coral_lake_transport
私も現実ではほとんど泳いだ経験は
ないんですけど……
シウネー
1040063_13_a
bg_13_coral_lake
はぁ……
シウネーは泳ぎを教えるのが
上手だね
ユウキ
1040063_12_a
そうそう
上手ですよ
シウネー
1040063_11_a
bg_13_coral_lake_transport
…………………
シウネー
1040063_10_a
bg_13_coral_lake
なるほど……
じゃあこんな感じ?
ユウキ
1040063_9_a
後は背泳ぎだからっていつでも
息継ぎができるとは思っちゃダメ
ちゃんとテンポを考えてくださいね
シウネー
1040063_8_a
bg_13_coral_lake_transport
あっ、でもあごは引いてくださいね
自分のおへそが少し見えるくらいが
ベストですよ
シウネー
1040063_7_a
bg_13_coral_lake
こんな感じ?
ユウキ
1040063_6_a
bg_13_coral_lake_transport
少し腰が曲がり過ぎかもしれません
シウネー
1040063_5_a
bg_13_coral_lake
うん……
イマイチどういう体勢が
いいのかわからない……
ユウキ
1040063_4_a
bg_13_coral_lake_transport
ユウキ、背泳ぎの練習はどう?
シウネー
1040063_3_a
bg_13_coral_lake
ぷはっ!
ユウキ
1040063_1_a
まあいいや!
よーし、じゃあ本日の
水泳レッスンスタート!
ユウキ
1040061_17_a
アスナの友達……
リーファかな?
ユウキ
1040061_16_a
実際アスナさんのお友達でも
現実で泳げない人は
仮想世界でも苦手らしいですし……
シウネー
1040061_15_a
泳ぐ感覚は現実と仮想世界は
似ていると聞いたんです
シウネー
1040061_14_a
えっ、どうして?
ユウキ
1040061_13_a
ユウキなら現実でも
きっと泳げるでしょうし……
シウネー
1040061_12_a
ふふっ、熱心ですね
とてもいい事だと思いますよ
シウネー
1040061_11_a
まだマスターできてない
泳ぎ方もあるから、
その練習ってことだよ
ユウキ
1040061_10_a
クロール、平泳ぎ、
背泳ぎ、バタフライ……
ユウキ
1040061_9_a
うん!
でも泳ぎ方って色々あるでしょ?
ユウキ
1040061_8_a
泳ぐ練習……?
ユウキあなた泳げますよね?
シウネー
1040061_7_a
やった!
じゃあボクここで泳ぐ練習するね!
ユウキ
1040061_6_a
ええ、いいですよ
まだ集合まで時間もあるし……
シウネー
1040061_5_a
シウネーここでちょっと
休んでいかない?
ユウキ
1040061_4_a
ええ、こんな場所があったんですね
シウネー
1040061_3_a
シウネー
1040061_2_a
bg_11_road_to_coral
わあ、綺麗な水辺だね
ユウキ
1040061_1_a
Good, I'm glad to hear it!
Kirito
1040058_16_a
It'll be a cinch to manage until
the Halloween season is over.
Liz
1040058_15_a
But seriously, thank you, Kirito.
Now I don't have to worry about
running my shop anymore.
Liz
1040058_14_a
Hahaha, I'm kidding, I'm kidding!
Kirito
1040058_13_a
What's that supposed to mean?!
Agil
1040058_12_a
I can't imagine anywhere being
quiet where you're concerned, Agil.
Kirito
1040058_11_a
This place has been nice and
quiet ever since.
Agil
1040058_10_a
Ain't that something.
Well, you did us a solid, man.
Agil
1040058_9_a
What they did to you brought all
their past discretions to light,
which led to their punishment.
Kirito
1040058_8_a
It wasn't just for that. They'd
violated the code of conduct a
bunch of times.
Kirito
1040058_7_a
Yeah? Well, I can't say I'm not
happy, but if I hadn't been so
dumb...
Liz
1040058_6_a
Just wanted to let you know that
player who conned you ended up
having their account suspended.
Kirito
1040058_5_a
Well, I'll be, if it ain't the
Street Stall Savior himself.
Agil
1040058_4_a
Agil
1040058_3_a
Oh, hey, Kirito!
Liz
1040058_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
Heeey! Liz, Agil!
Kirito
1040058_1_a
Hehe, you can if you want to.
Liz
1040057_27_a
Am I supposed to take that as
a compliment?
Kirito
1040057_26_a
You're the same as ever.
Liz
1040057_25_a
No one hurts my friends and gets
away with it.
Kirito
1040057_24_a
Hehehe... Thanks, Kirito. It was
nice of you to go to all that
trouble just to help me out.
Liz
1040057_23_a
Hehe, well, so is conning people.
Kirito
1040057_22_a
Dude... That's just cruel...
Liz
1040057_21_a
Not that I'd know anything
about that.
Kirito
1040057_20_a
Yep, so no one would bat an eye
at it being destroyed by another
player or a monster afterwards.
Kirito
1040057_19_a
But your avatar just stays
wherever it was when you log
out of ALO...
Liz
1040057_18_a
Haha, no. They logged out in
a split second.
Kirito
1040057_17_a
Wait, what? Isn't that, like...
torture?
Liz
1040057_16_a
And I took 'em out into the middle
of nowhere and beat them within an
inch of death a couple of times.
Kirito
1040057_15_a
I got back the Yuld you spent.
Kirito
1040057_14_a
And then what happened?
Liz
1040057_13_a
I let 'em try the same con on me
and caught 'em red-handed.
Kirito
1040057_12_a
Well, to be fair, I did just kind
of happen to run into them in that
area. It was pretty much pure luck.
Kirito
1040057_11_a
Y-You did all that?
In like, no time at all?!
Liz
1040057_10_a
I figured whoever it was might
strike again, so I found the
monsters that spawn those items.
Kirito
1040057_9_a
And I had the devs give me a list
of other players who got conned
with downgraded items like you.
Kirito
1040057_8_a
I used your description to look up
their avatar, and I put a notice
on the bulletin board for them.
Kirito
1040057_7_a
Seriously?!
Y-You did that...?
How...?
Liz
1040057_6_a
I found the jerk who conned you,
the one who's been working this area.
I knocked 'em flat on their butt!
Kirito
1040057_5_a
What are you talking about...?
Liz
1040057_4_a
pant
... 
gasp
Heh... If I'm this
out of breath in VR, I must have
gotten a bit too excited...
Kirito
1040057_3_a
Kirito...!
Liz
1040057_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
pant
pant
...
Kirito
1040057_1_a
Kirito...
Liz
1040055_20_a
I'll sniff them out!
Kirito
1040055_19_a
It's not over yet. Describe their
avatar to me in as much detail
as you can.
Kirito
1040055_18_a
No... I doubt they're still here...
This sucks... I can't believe I
fell for that con!
Liz
1040055_17_a
Do you know where that player
went?
Kirito
1040055_16_a
Grrr...! I'm such an idiot...
Liz
1040055_15_a
They manipulated the model...
If I had just examined it more
thoroughly, I would have known!
Liz
1040055_14_a
I don't believe you of all people
would miss something like that.
Kirito
1040055_13_a
The design is the same,
but the coloring isn't...
Liz
1040055_12_a
Do they look alike?
Kirito
1040055_11_a
It's just a downgraded version
of one of the new items!
Liz
1040055_10_a
But...I was wrong! It wasn't what
I thought it was. It wasn't a
rare shield at all!
Liz
1040055_9_a
I figured I could break it down
and make a bunch of stuff with it,
so I bought it at a high price...
Liz
1040055_8_a
There was this player who came by
to sell me a pretty rare shield...
Liz
1040055_7_a
What do you mean?!
Kirito
1040055_6_a
They got me...
Liz
1040055_5_a
Liz? What's wrong?
Kirito
1040055_4_a
I guess Agil's gone off somewhere
else...
Kirito
1040055_3_a
...
Liz
1040055_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
Liz, I'm back!
Kirito
1040055_1_a
Thanks, bro.
Agil
1040053_20_a
Okay. I'm going to go poke around
and see if I can't find anything.
Kirito
1040053_19_a
That's what I'm worried about...
Liz
1040053_18_a
I see... Hopefully it doesn't get
any worse...
Kirito
1040053_17_a
People've contacted the devs, but
I guess they still haven't been
able to catch whoever it is.
Agil
1040053_16_a
Someone is definitely up to no
good.
Agil
1040053_15_a
Nah, man, we're fine for now. But
there've been these rumors going
around for the last few days.
Agil
1040053_14_a
Neither of you have been affected
by anything like that, have you?
Kirito
1040053_13_a
That's what I'm talking about. It
seems this place is just as
vulnerable as anywhere else.
Liz
1040053_12_a
There are all sorts of loopholes
unscrupulous players can exploit
after an update like that.
Kirito
1040053_11_a
or to set up an illegitimate shop
by spreading lies and rumors.
Kirito
1040053_10_a
which would make it easy to
price gouge-or to buy up the
supply and hoard it,
Kirito
1040053_9_a
Sure. It's still too early to be
certain of what these new items
are actually worth,
Kirito
1040053_8_a
so it's not hard to imagine someone
using the chaos to their advantage
for...dishonest goals, right?
Liz
1040053_7_a
There are all sorts of info flying
around about all that new content,
Liz
1040053_6_a
Yeah.
Kirito
1040053_5_a
Well, they released all sorts of
special materials and equipment
for the Halloween events, right?
Liz
1040053_4_a
Agil
1040053_3_a
Liz
1040053_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
What is it, Liz?
Did something happen?
Kirito
1040053_1_a
...?
Kirito
1040051_19_a
Yeah, you could say that.
I guess...
Liz
1040051_18_a
I take it you two're doing pretty
well, then?
Kirito
1040051_17_a
Eh, I'm making a killing!
'Sides, being a street vendor is
kinda fun.
Agil
1040051_16_a
Don't get me started! And I really
wanted one of those Halloween
items, too!
Liz
1040051_15_a
Oh, you know, just paying a visit
to some overworked friends too
busy to even go on a measly quest.
Kirito
1040051_14_a
What's up, Kirito?
Liz
1040051_13_a
Yo, Kirito.
Agil
1040051_12_a
Agil
1040051_11_a
Hey, you two.
Kirito
1040051_10_a
That's for sure, hahaha.
Agil
1040051_9_a
Haha, even if they are just
pop-up shops.
Liz
1040051_8_a
Still, it was nice of them to
make space for us to set up extra
locations, right?
Liz
1040051_7_a
it's like those of us who run
shops just can't get away from
dealing with all of that.
Agil
1040051_6_a
Now that they've made this
stall area,
Agil
1040051_5_a
Man, there sure are a ton of
those Halloween events going on.
Agil
1040051_4_a
Well, since I have the day off in
the real world, I figured I'd dive
in when I woke up and get to work.
Liz
1040051_3_a
Hey, Liz. Never took you for
much of an early bird.
Agil
1040051_2_a
bg_event_halloween_town
Morning, Agil!
Liz
1040051_1_a
Haha, okay, okay...
Kirito
1040048_22_a
That's right!
Yui
1040048_21_a
Hehe, you'll find out soon enough.
Right, Yui?
Asuna
1040048_20_a
What?! What devious schemes are
you hatching?!
Kirito
1040048_19_a
Since you can't seem to control
your own eyes, Kirito...you get
a trick!
Asuna
1040048_18_a
Trick or treat, huh?
Asuna
1040048_17_a
Mommy, you should change, and
then we can go trick or treating
together!
Yui
1040048_16_a
Y-You say that, but I just can't
help it...
Kirito
1040048_15_a
I'll put it on, okay?!
Asuna
1040048_14_a
I guess... Wait a second.
Quit staring at me like that!
Asuna
1040048_13_a
This might not be the avatar I
converted over from SAO, but it
does still kinda look like me...
Kirito
1040048_12_a
You don't understand, Kirito,
because my avatar actually looks
like I do in real life.
Asuna
1040048_11_a
Then why'd you go through all
that trouble if you won't even
wear it?
Kirito
1040048_10_a
H-Huh?! N-Now you've got me all
embarrassed about it...
Asuna
1040048_9_a
I-I wasn't! But if you're so
worried about that, just show us
so I don't have to imagine!
Kirito
1040048_8_a
Kirito! Don't you go imagining
anything weird!
Asuna
1040048_7_a
Me too, Yui.
Hm... Asuna as a demon...
Kirito
1040048_6_a
I can't wait any longer!
I want to see it, Mommy!
Yui
1040048_5_a
Yeah. I already had everything
else I needed, so I had Liz do
the honors for me.
Asuna
1040048_4_a
Yui
1040048_3_a
Asuna
1040048_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Whoa, so you were able to make
the equipment?
Kirito
1040048_1_a
Yep, I got everything I needed,
thanks to you!
Asuna
1040047_32_a
So you got them, then?
Sinon
1040047_31_a
I'm the one who should be thanking
you for helping me with this quest
so I could get those materials!
Asuna
1040047_30_a
Hehe, but I really can't thank
you enough. Both of you.
Silica
1040047_29_a
Hahaha, are you trying to butter
me up for something?
Asuna
1040047_28_a
I would expect nothing less of
a seasoned VRMMO player like you.
Sinon
1040047_27_a
Asuna...
Silica
1040047_26_a
I didn't want Silica to have to
suffer like I did...
Asuna
1040047_25_a
I used a similar tactic to get my
weapon back that time too.
Asuna
1040047_24_a
Well, a while back, one of my
weapons was stolen, and I felt
so helpless.
Asuna
1040047_23_a
Even if they had, they wouldn't
have had the courage to try it.
Sinon
1040047_22_a
No one else could have thought
that up but you.
Silica
1040047_21_a
Yeah! Dropping a weapon on purpose
as bait so we could trap it
was such a good idea!
Silica
1040047_20_a
Asuna, your plan of attack was
brilliant.
Sinon
1040047_19_a
Good! I know that's your favorite
weapon. I'm glad you got it back.
Asuna
1040047_18_a
The dagger it stole is back in
my inventory!
Silica
1040047_17_a
Yay!
Th-Thank you very much!
Silica
1040047_16_a
Phew, we beat it!
Asuna
1040047_15_a
GYAAAAAAAAAH!
Demon
1040047_14_a
Taaaaake THIIIIIIS!
Asuna
1040047_13_a
It's not going anywhere after
that! Time to finish this thing!
Asuna
1040047_12_a
Guhwaaaaaagh!
Demon
1040047_11_a
CHIIIIIIIIIIRP!
Pina
1040047_10_a
Got it!
Pina, drown it in bubbles!
Silica
1040047_9_a
It's down!
Silica, now's your chance!
Asuna
1040047_8_a
Gyaah!
Demon
1040047_7_a
Hyah!
Sinon
1040047_6_a
I won't let it escape!
Sinon
1040047_5_a
Sinonon! It's running toward you!
Asuna
1040047_4_a
Sinon
1040047_3_a
Asuna
1040047_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Khehehe!
Demon
1040047_1_a
A-Asuna...?
Silica
1040045_29_a
Hehehe...
Asuna
1040045_28_a
Don't apologize! It wasn't your
fault. Besides, I just thought of
a great battle plan...
Asuna
1040045_27_a
Thank you very much...
I'm sorry, I know I said
I could handle these monsters...
Silica
1040045_26_a
I know you will. Sounds like
you'll get your dagger back in no
time, Silica, so no need to worry!
Asuna
1040045_25_a
Asuna, Silica, I swear,
I'll beat them into the ground!
Sinon
1040045_24_a
and those little dimwits only
wanted someone to prank. They
won't get away with this!
Sinon
1040045_23_a
Of course I am.
We were fighting a serious battle,
Sinon
1040045_22_a
Ehehe... Sinonon, you're getting
pretty intimidating...
Asuna
1040045_21_a
It seems no trick is beneath these
demons... Heh, but this makes
things way more interesting...
Sinon
1040045_20_a
Y-Yes...
Silica
1040045_19_a
Th-They pinched you?! And that's
when you dropped your dagger?
Asuna
1040045_18_a
They...came up behind me and...
and pinched my...
my bottom... Waaaahhhhh!
Silica
1040045_17_a
W-Well, it was those tiny
demons...
Silica
1040045_16_a
It's not often you lose your grip
on your weapon, Silica.
Sinon
1040045_15_a
I... I dropped it...
Silica
1040045_14_a
Did they steal it from you when
you had it equipped? Or did they
pick it up when you dropped it?
Asuna
1040045_13_a
I thought something was weird
with the way they ran around
giggling like that...
Sinon
1040045_12_a
Hmph!
Sinon
1040045_11_a
What?
That means it's a snatcher!
Asuna
1040045_10_a
That monster...
took my dagger...
Waaaaahhhh!
Silica
1040045_9_a
We can't understand you if you
don't use words, Silica...
Sinon
1040045_8_a
sniffle
hic
...
Silica
1040045_7_a
S-Silica! What happened?!
Asuna
1040045_6_a
Asuna
1040045_5_a
Silica?
Sinon
1040045_4_a
Asuna
1040045_3_a
Sinon
1040045_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
A-Asunaaa...
Sinooon...
Silica
1040045_1_a
As ready as I'll ever be.
Sinon
1040043_18_a
Hehe, we're counting on you,
Silica. You two ready to go?
Asuna
1040043_17_a
Sounds like I'm a perfect match
for an enemy like that!
Silica
1040043_16_a
Apparently its attacks are nothing
to worry about, but it is quick,
so we should still be careful.
Asuna
1040043_15_a
That's the one we have to
get the materials from.
Asuna
1040043_14_a
Yeah, apparently it's a little
demon. Like a kind of gremlin...
Silica
1040043_13_a
That's also the type of monster
we have to defeat, isn't it?
Sinon
1040043_12_a
Yeah. It's kind of outside my
comfort zone, but it IS cute...
Asuna
1040043_11_a
So, Asuna, the Halloween costume
you want is the demon one, right?
Silica
1040043_10_a
I see. It must be hard being
such a popular blacksmith...
Sinon
1040043_9_a
People are flooding her shop with
all the new Halloween items,
so she's super busy.
Asuna
1040043_8_a
Well, she was planning on being
here, but something came up and
now she can't come.
Asuna
1040043_7_a
I'm just here to help...
Where's Liz?
Sinon
1040043_6_a
Absolutely.
Asuna
1040043_5_a
Don't worry about it! But it's my
turn to get my costume next
once we finish this quest!
Silica
1040043_4_a
Sinon
1040043_3_a
Silica
1040043_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Sinonon, Silica, thanks for
agreeing to get together today
just to help me out.
Asuna
1040043_1_a
Yeah!
Asuna
1040041_24_a
Hehe, then what are we waiting
for? Let's pick out our costumes!
Liz
1040041_23_a
I completely agree too!
Silica
1040041_22_a
Whoa, Liz, it totally does!
You're so right!
Asuna
1040041_21_a
because we get to see what it'd be
like in reality without it actually
BEING reality! Make sense?
Liz
1040041_20_a
on an avatar that looked
absolutely nothing like you either.
How we are right now is awesome
Liz
1040041_19_a
Well, let's think about it. It'd
be weird to wear in real life,
but it wouldn't be as fun to wear
Liz
1040041_18_a
You have a good point...
Asuna
1040041_17_a
I probably wouldn't know what
to say... Hehehe...
Silica
1040041_16_a
So if someone asked me if
I was comfortable wearing any
of these outfits at all...
Silica
1040041_15_a
Um... But the avatars we converted
over from SAO do kind of look
like we do in real life...
Silica
1040041_14_a
Hehe, true.
Liz
1040041_13_a
And that's exactly why we're
doing it in a VRMMO!
Asuna
1040041_12_a
You were right, Silica! We'd never
be able to wear that in reality!
Liz
1040041_11_a
Seriously... And they all look
like total cosplays!
Liz
1040041_10_a
Whoa... There's so many!
Asuna
1040041_9_a
Hmmm... Here's a list of the
Halloween-exclusive items you
can get...
Asuna
1040041_8_a
Okay!
Silica
1040041_7_a
Sure! Let me see what our
choices are...
Asuna
1040041_6_a
Totally! So should we give one of
those Halloween subquests a shot?
Liz
1040041_5_a
Good idea! After all, we can't
really wear Halloween costumes
that look like that in reality!
Silica
1040041_4_a
Liz
1040041_3_a
Silica
1040041_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Hey, maybe we should try and get
one of those Halloween-exclusive
outfits or something too!
Asuna
1040041_1_a
I'm sure you will.
Kirito
1040038_22_a
but hearing that story makes it
even better. I hope I'll make
that old guy proud.
Liz
1040038_21_a
Getting a rare item is great
in and of itself,
Liz
1040038_20_a
Yeah. He even mentioned seeing Liz
brought back those memories...
Kirito
1040038_19_a
He really just wanted a quiet
life in his hometown...
Klein
1040038_18_a
Oh...
Liz
1040038_17_a
All the info for this quest's been
released to the public including
that blacksmith's background.
Kirito
1040038_16_a
How do you know all that, Kirito?
Liz
1040038_15_a
So he hid himself in Butterfly
Valley, where he knew he'd never
see another Leprechaun again.
Kirito
1040038_14_a
Customers flocked to his smithy,
but worry over his ability to keep
pace with demand ate away at him.
Kirito
1040038_13_a
Time took its toll even on this
renowned blacksmith. Each passing
year drained him a little more...
Kirito
1040038_12_a
sniffle
...
Klein
1040038_11_a
I-I'm not crying
you're crying!
I mean, that was really touching
to watch, so I can't blame you!
Klein
1040038_10_a
What are you crying for?!
Liz
1040038_9_a
sniff
sniff
...
Klein
1040038_8_a
Uh, excuse me? What's with you?
...Klein? Seriously,
what's wrong?
Liz
1040038_7_a
Well, you get what you get,
so don't throw a fit!
Klein
1040038_6_a
All I did was enhance
some stupid mace...
Liz
1040038_5_a
Yeah...
But is "awesome" the right word?
Liz
1040038_4_a
Klein
1040038_3_a
Liz
1040038_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Not exactly how I thought this'd
play out, but it's awesome you got
that rare equipment, Liz!
Kirito
1040038_1_a
And thank you... Seeing you has
brought back memories of home
I'd thought long forgotten...
Leprechaun
1040037_20_a
Please, I'm no longer fit to wield
sword or hammer. It's wasted on
the likes of me. Take it, friend.
Leprechaun
1040037_19_a
W-We can't accept
something so precious!
Liz
1040037_18_a
I received this as a token
of that special privilege.
Leprechaun
1040037_17_a
They took pity on me in my great
age and allowed me to stay here,
though I am not of their kind.
Leprechaun
1040037_16_a
Though an heirloom of the wind
tribe, only Leprechauns can equip
it, so they gifted it to me.
Leprechaun
1040037_15_a
item_event_104003_armor
But...take this. It is the least I
can do for a fellow smith after
you came all this way to see me.
Leprechaun
1040037_14_a
I'm afraid your journey has been
in vain. There is nothing I can
do for you.
Leprechaun
1040037_13_a
Gramps...
Liz
1040037_12_a
The reason I secluded myself here
was because I knew I'd reached
my limits as a blacksmith...
Leprechaun
1040037_11_a
It's been some time since
I've crafted anything of worth...
Leprechaun
1040037_10_a
NPCs without AI normally stick to
a predetermined script, so
shut up and listen!
Kirito
1040037_9_a
Shhh!
Kirito
1040037_8_a
Nah, man, we actually weren't
thinking that at all-
Klein
1040037_7_a
I imagine you must want me to
smith something for you, if you
have come all this way.
Leprechaun
1040037_6_a
Y-Yes...
Liz
1040037_5_a
Kirito
1040037_4_a
Klein
1040037_3_a
Liz
1040037_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_sunset
So you heard the rumors about me
and came to see if they're true.
Leprechaun
1040037_1_a
O-Okay...
Liz
1040035_31_a
You three... Come here...
Leprechaun
1040035_30_a
Is that gramps the Leprechaun
we've been looking for?!
Klein
1040035_29_a
Liz, someone's here!
Kirito
1040035_28_a
...
???

Klein

Kirito
1040035_25_a
item_event_104003_mace
bg_20_butterfly_valley_sunset
The enhancements I tried on this
somewhat rare mace I got a
while back worked...
Liz
1040035_24_a
Here goes...
Liz
1040035_23_a
Hahaha! You've got this, Liz!
Kirito
1040035_22_a
Dummy, you mean "forge"!
Liz
1040035_21_a
Your guess is as good as mine.
Just gotta do it, right? So
forage your little heart out!
Klein
1040035_20_a
It's not like I need to use any
rare materials or anything, right?
I just have to make SOMETHING...
Liz
1040035_19_a
S-Sure... I can probably scrape
something together from what I've
got in my inventory...
Liz
1040035_18_a
Will you give it a shot, Liz?
Kirito
1040035_17_a
Cut it out, Klein! I haven't even
done anything yet and you're
making me sweat!
Liz
1040035_16_a
but if Liz isn't a skilled enough
blacksmith, then no one is!
Piece of cake!
Klein
1040035_15_a
You gotta have whatever skill is
relevant above a certain level to
trigger these things,
Klein
1040035_14_a
That makes total sense!
Klein
1040035_13_a
If I try smithing something here,
something might happen!
Liz
1040035_12_a
Bingo. So even if no one will talk
to you, Liz...
Kirito
1040035_11_a
That Leprechaun is a blacksmith!
Liz
1040035_10_a
Oh!
Klein
1040035_9_a
Hint? What hint? There's a
Leprechaun living in secret
somewhere, and... and...
Klein
1040035_8_a
Well, that seems the obvious
conclusion, but didn't you catch
that other hint?
Kirito
1040035_7_a
is bring Sinon or Silica, and see if
Cait Siths get the same blank
stare as our Sylph pal did.
Klein
1040035_6_a
The only thing we can do now...
Klein
1040035_5_a
Dude, K-dawg, you heard that
Sylph. It's no good, they just
clam up anyway.
Klein
1040035_4_a
Liz
1040035_3_a
Klein
1040035_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
Maybe we can try one last thing.
Kirito
1040035_1_a
...
Kirito
1040033_23_a
Then this really is just a wild
goose chase...
Klein
1040033_22_a
Not even a Sylph can crack
this...?
Liz
1040033_21_a
Oh, uh, bye...
Kirito
1040033_20_a
Ugh! This was a total waste of
time. Back to Sylvain I go...
Catch ya later.
Sylph
1040033_19_a
But I thought they'd be all
buddy-buddy with a Sylph...
Klein
1040033_18_a
S-Seriously?
Liz
1040033_17_a
No matter who I asked about it,
they all told me the same thing:
"No idea."
Sylph
1040033_16_a
That mysterious Leprechaun that
supposedly settled down here?
It's nothing but baloney.
Sylph
1040033_15_a
What?
A Sylph...
Kirito
1040033_14_a
So you three came here because
of that rumor too, huh?
???
1040033_13_a
Yeah...
Liz
1040033_12_a
Welp, looks like we got no choice
but to come back later and try
again.
Klein
1040033_11_a
Seems like it.
Kirito
1040033_10_a
And Silica, Sinon, and Leafa
can't dive in today, can they...?
Liz
1040033_9_a
Guess not...
Kirito
1040033_8_a
Guess there's nothing else we can
do if we can't even get them to
tell us where this Leprechaun is.
Klein
1040033_7_a
I'd have expected they'd speak to
you at least, Liz, now that
there's a Leprechaun living there.
Kirito
1040033_6_a
Looks like you really do have to
be a Sylph or Cait Sith to talk
to any of those NPCs.
Liz
1040033_5_a
I'm coming up short too.
Liz
1040033_4_a
Yeah, a whole bunch of nada.
No one'll so much as give me
the time of day!
Klein
1040033_3_a
Hey Liz, Klein!
Anything yet?
Kirito
1040033_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
Hmmm...
Liz
1040033_1_a
You got it.
Kirito
1040031_28_a
Well, what're we waiting for?
A new quest is calling our names!
Let's go check it out!
Klein
1040031_27_a
Yeah.
Liz
1040031_26_a
So that's what's got your
interest piqued.
Kirito
1040031_25_a
Yep. Anyway, apparently this
Leprechaun's really making waves
as a blacksmith out there.
Liz
1040031_24_a
Yeah. The NPCs wouldn't talk to
anyone but Sugu and Silica, a
Sylph and Cait Sith, respectively.
Kirito
1040031_23_a
It's that segregated?
Klein
1040031_22_a
A Leprechaun? But I thought only
Sylphs and Cait Siths could
live in that valley.
Kirito
1040031_21_a
Well, lately I've been hearing
about a Leprechaun NPC that moved
there and opened up a smithy.
Liz
1040031_20_a
Hahaha! Must be rough having
to balance gaming and working.
Kirito
1040031_19_a
I missed out on that one! Man, I
knew I shoulda punched out before
my boss got ahold of me...
Klein
1040031_18_a
from the group of goblins that
stole it from the wind tribe.
Kirito
1040031_17_a
Yeah, for that quest where we had
to get back the Jewel of
Serenity
Kirito
1040031_16_a
Well...
A while back we went to
Butterfly Valley, right?
Liz
1040031_15_a
Oh, come on. Maybe we can help?
You should tell us.
Kirito
1040031_14_a
Um... You know, nothing, really.
Liz
1040031_13_a
You were pretty zoned out there.
What's on your mind?
Kirito
1040031_12_a
Sure, she snaps out of it when
YOU call her name...
Klein
1040031_11_a
Wha-?!
Oh, uh, hi Kirito...
Hi Klein. Welcome, welcome.
Liz
1040031_10_a
Hey, Liz!
Kirito
1040031_9_a
What? No way.
She's just deep in thought.
Kirito
1040031_8_a
Liz is totally cold-shouldering
me...
Klein
1040031_7_a
What's wrong?
Kirito
1040031_6_a
...
Liz
1040031_5_a
I saaaaid, "Heeeeeey, Liiiiiz!"
Klein
1040031_4_a
...
Liz
1040031_3_a

1040031_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Heeeeeey, Liiiiiz!
Klein
1040031_1_a
Sure thing! We've got your back!
Kirito
1040028_19_a
But I've learned my lesson!
I'm gonna ask you guys for help
all the time now, okay?!
Liz
1040028_18_a
I wanted to do it on my own, you
know? But...I think I pushed
myself too hard.
Liz
1040028_17_a
My shop was doing so well here
in ALO, I felt like I had to push
myself to succeed...
Liz
1040028_16_a
Thank you...
Liz
1040028_15_a
I'm your friend too, so I wanted
to help. So if you ever need a
hand, just call us. Okay?
Kirito
1040028_14_a
Asuna and Silica told me that they
helped you out the other day...
Kirito
1040028_13_a
Hehehe. No need to apologize.
You really saved my bacon.
Liz
1040028_12_a
Ha ha, right. No more cool.
Noted!
Kirito
1040028_11_a
Stop trying to act all cool!
Liz
1040028_10_a
I just...you know! Wanted to
help out. From the shadows.
Like a dark knight!
Kirito
1040028_9_a
Oh... I was, wasn't I...?
Kirito
1040028_8_a
Well, duh. You were right there
when I said I'd do it.
Liz
1040028_7_a
Urk...
Was it that obvious?
Kirito
1040028_6_a
You picked up the ore I needed
for me while I was sleeping,
right?
Liz
1040028_5_a
Umm... I don't know what you're
talking about...
Kirito
1040028_4_a
...Thank you.
Liz
1040028_3_a
A-Ah! Hi...Liz...
Kirito
1040028_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
KIIIRIIITOOO!!!
Liz
1040028_1_a
item_event_84003_ingot
Isn't this the ore I was going to
gather yesterday? B-But, why is
it here?
Liz
1040027_17_a
Oh no, what do I do!
I'm so royally-huh?
Liz
1040027_16_a
I've gotta open the shop!
W-Wait, no! I've gotta go
get ore...!
Liz
1040027_15_a
Oh, this is bad, this so bad!
Look at the time! Gah!
Liz
1040027_14_a
WHAAAAAAT?!
IT'S MORNING ALREADY?!
Liz
1040027_13_a
Huh...?
Liz
1040027_12_a
Mmm...
Liz
1040027_11_a
Zzz...
Liz
1040027_10_a
...
Liz
1040027_9_a
Just an hour or so!
Let me set my alarm...
Liz
1040027_8_a
Then again...I can afford a
little nap first, right?
Liz
1040027_7_a
I should probably do some
maintenance on my tools too.
Liz
1040027_6_a
I did promise, didn't I...?
Liz
1040027_5_a
Oh yeah. And I gotta go gather
some ore...
Liz
1040027_4_a
There's still a bunch of items
I need to repair and craft for
tomorrow...
Liz
1040027_3_a
Oh, right...
I still have some work to do...
Liz
1040027_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Phew. Another day, another buck.
Liz
1040027_1_a
...
Kirito
1040025_28_a
Thank you for your patronage!
Liz
1040025_27_a
Ahaha, right...
Got it... Still, awesome!
???
1040025_26_a
You do realize I'm going to charge
you a premium, though, right?
Liz
1040025_25_a
Really? You mean it! Thanks! Liz's
Smithy rocks! Best service in ALO!
???
1040025_24_a
I planned on swinging by there
soon myself anyway. I'll grab
some for you too.
Liz
1040025_23_a
Yeah, it might be a bit rough.
You know what, don't worry!
Liz
1040025_22_a
So this dungeon where I can find
the ore I need, is it too hard
for someone of my abilities?
???
1040025_21_a
Ah, s-sorry... One moment...
Liz
1040025_20_a
Excuse me! Lisbeth!
I was next on line!
???
1040025_19_a
More importantly, what brings you
here today, Kirito?
Liz
1040025_18_a
R-Right...
If you say so...
Kirito
1040025_17_a
N-No, I'm not tired! Really! I'm
fine! I'm just so...happy that I'm
so busy I can't ever sleep. Ever.
Liz
1040025_16_a
You look exhausted! Are you okay?
Kirito
1040025_15_a
Looks like you're doing well for
yourself-hold up!
Kirito
1040025_14_a
Ah, Kirito!
Liz
1040025_13_a
Gah! Why is it so crowded?!
Kirito
1040025_12_a
Liiiz! Hey, Liz!
Kirito
1040025_11_a
...
Liz
1040025_10_a
S-Sorry!
Liz
1040025_9_a
Two days, huh? Alright, forget it.
I'll come back another time.
???
1040025_8_a
Umm... Two days, maybe?
Liz
1040025_7_a
Dude, there's a waiting list?!
How long's it gonna take?
???
1040025_6_a
Sorry, I'm kinda booked up right
now... Can you put your name on
the waiting list?
Liz
1040025_5_a
Lisbeth, right?
Can you repair my weapon?
???
1040025_4_a
Ah! S-Sorry! I'm a bit behind!
Can you come back tomorrow?
Liz
1040025_3_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Excuse me, Miss. I came to pick
up the weapon I ordered...
???
1040025_2_a
Liz
1040025_1_a
Hehe, thanks, you two.
Liz
1040023_22_a
Y-Yeah! We've got your back!
Silica
1040023_21_a
So don't hesitate to ask us for
help, okay?
Asuna
1040023_20_a
I think you'll be this busy until
the buzz dies down.
Asuna
1040023_19_a
I guess that's the secret to your
popularity!
Silica
1040023_18_a
After all, I did spend two years
blacksmithing sunup to sundown!
Ahaha!
Liz
1040023_17_a
Well, I am pretty amazing.
Liz
1040023_16_a
Not that many players in ALO can
compete!
Asuna
1040023_15_a
And, Liz, your blacksmithing
skills are off the chart!
Asuna
1040023_14_a
But skills carry over almost
perfectly!
Asuna
1040023_13_a
Yeah! Some things aren't carried
over when you convert an SAO
character to ALO...
Asuna
1040023_12_a
I am?
Liz
1040023_11_a
Word on the street is a master
smith just imported their avatar
into ALO. You're a hot topic!
Asuna
1040023_10_a
I'm happy to hear that! But
really, Liz, wow! You have so
many customers!
Silica
1040023_9_a
That'd be more than enough help!
Liz
1040023_8_a
We'd only be able to handle
basic chores...
Asuna
1040023_7_a
We'd love to help, but Silica and
I aren't planning on raising our
blacksmithing skills.
Asuna
1040023_6_a
You guys were real lifesavers
today! I think you're right:
I need to hire help.
Liz
1040023_5_a
Thanks, Silica!
Liz
1040023_4_a
Hey, Liz! I put up your business
hours on a sign outside!
Silica
1040023_3_a
Those? I'm going to use them
later, so just drop them on the
counter. Thanks!
Liz
1040023_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Liz, what should I do with these
materials?
Asuna
1040023_1_a
Yup! No problem! Leave it to me!
Liz
1040021_17_a
Excuse me, Liz? I saw this weapon
on a website. Can you make it for
me?
???
1040021_16_a
Nah, I'm fine! This is nothing!
When you're in retail, busy is
best!
Liz
1040021_15_a
There are way too many customers for
you to handle alone! Let me
know if I can help out, okay?
Silica
1040021_14_a
Liz, are you going to be okay?
Silica
1040021_13_a
But, thanks to great customers like
you two, business is booming!
Liz
1040021_12_a
I'm doing surprisingly well. I was
honestly worried my shop would
tank when I converted to ALO...
Liz
1040021_11_a
Oh, hey there, you two!
Welcome!
Liz
1040021_10_a
Silica
1040021_9_a
Wow, Liz...
Your shop's really popular!
Asuna
1040021_8_a
Yes, it is! Welcome!
What can I do for you today!
Liz
1040021_7_a
Excuse me!
Is this Lisbeth's Blacksmith Shop?
???
1040021_6_a
Thanks a bunch!
You can just drop them there.
Liz
1040021_5_a
Hello, remember me from the other
day? I brought the materials you
asked for.
???
1040021_4_a
Thank you! Come again!
Liz
1040021_3_a
Excuse me, but I was wondering
if you could fix my weapon.
???
1040021_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo
Welcome, noble customers!
Liz
1040021_1_a
Okay!
Asuna
1040018_25_a
Nope, nothing!
Come on, let's hurry up and get
back. I wanna fix that armor ASAP!
Liz
1040018_24_a
Huh? Did you say something?
Asuna
1040018_23_a
I suppose I'll just have to watch
over him from the sidelines...
Liz
1040018_22_a
Q-Quit it already, you!
Asuna
1040018_21_a
Hahaha, you are so sweet
it's almost sickening.
Liz
1040018_20_a
Of course!
Asuna
1040018_19_a
Tell him all would have been lost
without the help of superstar
blacksmith Liz, so he owes me one.
Liz
1040018_18_a
When you give it back to him,
be sure to tell him.
Liz
1040018_17_a
Yeah...
Asuna
1040018_16_a
Well, for now, chin up,
okay, Asuna?
Liz
1040018_15_a
B-Better, of course!
Asuna
1040018_14_a
Ehehe... I don't know if that's
meant to make me feel better
or worse...
Liz
1040018_13_a
But...I'm sure it'll be fine.
You never let me down, Liz!
Asuna
1040018_12_a
Yeah... You're right.
Asuna
1040018_11_a
It's just that you have to expect
the unexpected with this game,
you know?
Liz
1040018_10_a
Don't worry.
In all likelihood, it'll go fine.
Liz
1040018_9_a
Don't look at me like I just said
there's no such thing as Santa!
I'm not trying to be mean.
Liz
1040018_8_a
What?!
Are you saying you might
make a mistake?!
Asuna
1040018_7_a
We still gotta fight our way back.
And just 'cause I'm a blacksmith
doesn't mean I'm perfect.
Liz
1040018_6_a
Don't thank me just yet.
Liz
1040018_5_a
Great! Thanks! I couldn't have
done it without you, Liz.
Asuna
1040018_4_a
Now we've got everything we need!
Liz
1040018_3_a
Liz
1040018_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
We did it!
Asuna
1040018_1_a
Y-Yeah!
Asuna
1040017_33_a
Well, we're almost finished,
so hang in there!
For his sake!
Liz
1040017_32_a
Ahaha!
Liz
1040017_31_a
L-Liz!
Asuna
1040017_30_a
Now that I know,
I'm never going to let you
live it down!
Liz
1040017_29_a
Hehehe.
Liz
1040017_28_a
See, I knew you'd tease me!
That's why I didn't say anything
in the first place!
Asuna
1040017_27_a
Oh-em-gee, Asuna,
could you be any more adorable?!
Liz
1040017_26_a
So you pretended you wanted it,
but really you were going to
fix it for him...
Liz
1040017_25_a
Then I told him to give it to me,
and he did.
Asuna
1040017_24_a
But when it was damaged,
Kirito had said it was special.
He looked so down about it.
Asuna
1040017_23_a
Kirito hardly ever
equips that armor...
Asuna
1040017_22_a
...
sigh
You saw right through me, huh?
Asuna
1040017_21_a
I just knew it had to be for him.
Liz
1040017_20_a
When you came to me with
that flustered look on your face,
Liz
1040017_19_a
Nope.
Liz
1040017_18_a
S-So...you've seen Kirito
wearing that armor before?!
Asuna
1040017_17_a
Anyway, I knew that armor wasn't
right for the vice commander of
the Knights of the Blood Oath.
Liz
1040017_16_a
Hehe, you're beet red!
You're so cute when you blush!
Liz
1040017_15_a
Th-Then why didn't you say
anything?!
Asuna
1040017_14_a
Oh, y'know, just from the get-go.
Liz
1040017_13_a
But, Liz-
How-?!
How long have you known?!
Asuna
1040017_12_a
Hehehe!
Liz
1040017_11_a
Huh?!
Asuna
1040017_10_a
S-Sure... Wait-
Asuna
1040017_9_a
We have to make sure it gets
back to Kirito safe and sound!
Liz
1040017_8_a
Got it.
Asuna
1040017_7_a
We're so close to fixing that
armor! Hang in there!
Liz
1040017_6_a
R-Right.
Asuna
1040017_5_a
Don't let your guard down, Asuna.
The mobs around here are tough.
Liz
1040017_4_a
Sure.
Asuna
1040017_3_a
Asuna
1040017_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
Alright, well, just a little
farther and we'll be there!
Liz
1040017_1_a
I wouldn't dream of it.
Asuna
1040015_30_a
Ehehehe... Don't think buttering
me up like that will get you
a discount or anything!
Liz
1040015_29_a
I-I don't do it for the thanks!
Liz
1040015_28_a
Thank you for everything
you've done, Liz.
And for everything you will do.
Asuna
1040015_27_a
Asuna...
Liz
1040015_26_a
that we're able to clear each
floor... I feel like I should've
realized that a long time ago.
Asuna
1040015_25_a
It's thanks to the support
of people like you
Asuna
1040015_24_a
It's thanks to hard-working people
like you that the Assault Team
is able to keep fighting.
Asuna
1040015_23_a
Wh-What do you mean?
Liz
1040015_22_a
You said I'm strong, but...
I don't think that's right at all.
Asuna
1040015_21_a
What is it? You have that
look on your face again...
Liz
1040015_20_a
Liz...
Asuna
1040015_19_a
I gotta tell this to the info
broker as soon as we get back!
Liz
1040015_18_a
...
Asuna
1040015_17_a
fewer people will be
at risk of dying, right?
Liz
1040015_16_a
And if this makes high-quality
armor more readily available,
Liz
1040015_15_a
They are, but I bet this would get
enough supply into circulation
to help balance demand!
Liz
1040015_14_a
But resources are limited, right?
Asuna
1040015_13_a
I bet its price would plummet!
Liz
1040015_12_a
If people knew
you could find it here,
Liz
1040015_11_a
Really...?
Asuna
1040015_10_a
I had no idea you
could mine it here, though!
Liz
1040015_9_a
It's really resistant, so you can
use it to make buffed armor! But
it's so pricey hardly anyone does.
Liz
1040015_8_a
The kind that costs
an arm and a leg!
Liz
1040015_7_a
Really? What kind?
Asuna
1040015_6_a
Nope,
I just spotted some rare ore!
Liz
1040015_5_a
What's the matter? Are you tired?
Asuna
1040015_4_a
Ah, sorry! Asuna, can you hold
on one second?
Liz
1040015_3_a
Liz
1040015_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
Liz...?
What is it?
Asuna
1040015_1_a
Hehe, stop already!
Asuna
1040013_30_a
Of course you are!
Have a little more faith in
yourself, Vice Commander!
Liz
1040013_29_a
Ehehe... I'm not nearly as
impressive as you think.
Asuna
1040013_28_a
It's because you have such intense
willpower that you're able
to grow so strong.
Liz
1040013_27_a
But that strength
comes from your heart.
Liz
1040013_26_a
I mean, you're a really high-level,
and your skill and experience
are way beyond mine...
Liz
1040013_25_a
Huh?
Asuna
1040013_24_a
Don't worry about it. I feel like
I understand where your strength
comes from a little better now.
Liz
1040013_23_a
Ah-I'm sorry,
that was kind of a sad thing
to bring up...
Asuna
1040013_22_a
I see...
Liz
1040013_21_a
That's why I keep fighting.
So their deaths won't have been
in vain.
Asuna
1040013_20_a
Some of those people
didn't make it...
Asuna
1040013_19_a
Asuna...
Liz
1040013_18_a
But there were people who taught
me what I needed to know to fight,
to survive in this world.
Asuna
1040013_17_a
I was just a clueless child.
Asuna
1040013_16_a
When I first got trapped in SAO,
I didn't know a single thing
about VRMMOs.
Asuna
1040013_15_a
It's the people who have
fought with me this far
who are really amazing.
Asuna
1040013_14_a
Asuna...?
Liz
1040013_13_a
Even if you do think of me that
way, that doesn't mean I'm
"amazing" or anything.
Asuna
1040013_12_a
...
Asuna
1040013_11_a
Now I realize my skill and resolve
is nothing compared to the players
putting their lives on the line.
Liz
1040013_10_a
I used to think that
I was a pretty decent fighter,
but now...
Liz
1040013_9_a
What?
That's not true...
Asuna
1040013_8_a
I should have known elite players
were a cut above the rest.
Liz
1040013_7_a
You're just such a sweet person,
I thought I had to look out for
you, like a big sister would...
Liz
1040013_6_a
Huh? Where's this coming from
all of a sudden?
Asuna
1040013_5_a
Asuna,
you really are amazing,
you know that?
Liz
1040013_4_a
What's wrong, Liz?
Asuna
1040013_3_a
Asuna
1040013_2_a
bg_10_stone_field
sigh
...
Liz
1040013_1_a
A-Alright...
Thanks, Liz.
Asuna
1040011_34_a
Come on, I'll lead the way.
Better get ready!
Liz
1040011_33_a
What are you talking about? There's
no way I'm gonna let my best friend
wander off into danger by herself!
Liz
1040011_32_a
What?!
No, you can't!
Asuna
1040011_31_a
Because "reasons," right?
Alright then, I'm coming with you.
Liz
1040011_30_a
I...
I just have to do this alone.
Asuna
1040011_29_a
Are you serious?
Why?!
Liz
1040011_28_a
N-No, I'm going to go by myself.
Asuna
1040011_27_a
Mining it is no easy task, y'know?
Maybe you should take some Knights
of the Blood Oath with you.
Liz
1040011_26_a
Of course!
Asuna
1040011_25_a
Why?
You thinking of going to get it?
Liz
1040011_24_a
What kind of ore?
Asuna
1040011_23_a
With the shape this is in, I'm
going to need some special
crafting ore.
Liz
1040011_22_a
What? What's wrong?
Asuna
1040011_21_a
Buuuuut...
Liz
1040011_20_a
Really?
Oh, that's such a relief!
Asuna
1040011_19_a
It's just barely this side of
functional, so in theory, I should
be able to fix it...
Liz
1040011_18_a
Let's see here...
Yeah, it's pretty beat up.
Liz
1040011_17_a
Ehehe...
Asuna
1040011_16_a
Huh.
It's kind of...
well, spartan.
Liz
1040011_15_a
It's pretty lightweight.
Liz
1040011_14_a
item_event_104001_armor
H-Here it is.
Asuna
1040011_13_a
Hold on one second.
I need to take it out of my
inventory.
Asuna
1040011_12_a
You got it.
Let me take a look!
Liz
1040011_11_a
W-Well, you see...
My armor's been damaged, and
I was hoping you could fix it...
Asuna
1040011_10_a
Where's the fearless vice
commander we all know and
love, hm?
Liz
1040011_9_a
What's with the face?
Go on, spit it out!
Liz
1040011_8_a
Um...
Asuna
1040011_7_a
What is it?
Liz
1040011_6_a
Hi, Liz. I need a favor...
Asuna
1040011_5_a
Oh-Hey, Asuna!
What's up?
Liz
1040011_4_a
Welcome, welcome!
Liz
1040011_3_a
...
Asuna
1040011_2_a
bg_07_lisbeth_smith_work
Alright, world, say hello
to Lisbeth's Smithy!
Liz
1040011_1_a
My lips are sealed!
Klein
950018_22_a
No, it's okay. Just don't tell
Agil about this, okay?
Rain
950018_21_a
O-Oh... Yeah, that makes sense...
Hey, sorry for laughing just now.
That wasn't cool.
Klein
950018_20_a
So when Agil started worrying
about me, I thought that maybe
this is what it feels like...
Rain
950018_19_a
But... My father left when I was
little, so I don't really know
what it's like to have a dad...
Rain
950018_18_a
I know that! Why do you think
I didn't tell him?!
Rain
950018_17_a
Sure, why not? Just don't tell
him, he'll flip his lid! He's way
too young to have a kid your age!
Klein
950018_16_a
H-Hey, it's not funny!
Stop laughing!
Rain
950018_15_a
Gahahaha!
That's hilarious!!
Klein
950018_14_a
What?! Agil?!
You can't be serious!!
Klein
950018_13_a
I just thought that he'd make a
pretty awesome dad...
Rain
950018_12_a
Agil's teaching me about items,
and worried about how my singing
is going and everything...
Rain
950018_11_a
Oh, you heard that, huh...
Hehe, well...
Rain
950018_10_a
What was it? I'm dying to know!
Klein
950018_9_a
You were about to say something
to Agil earlier, right?
Klein
950018_8_a
Excuse me?
Rain
950018_7_a
Actuaaally, before we head over...
Mind if I ask you something?
Klein
950018_6_a
Yeah, let's go!
Rain
950018_5_a
No thanks needed, it was my
pleasure. Now let's go find Agil.
He was over there, last I saw him.
Klein
950018_4_a
Thanks, Klein.
Rain
950018_3_a
Rain
950018_2_a
bg_10_field
Alright! That's the last material
we needed!
Klein
950018_1_a
Hehe, never mind...
Rain
950017_23_a
Yeah? What is it?
Agil
950017_22_a
Hehe, Agil... You know...
Rain
950017_21_a
For sure!
Rain
950017_20_a
Glad to have you on board.
Let's meet up IRL soon and hammer
out the details.
Agil
950017_19_a
Agil... Thank you so much!
I really appreciate it!
Rain
950017_18_a
Besides, most artists don't just
make a sudden break. You have
to start small and build up.
Agil
950017_17_a
Nah. Put on regular shows, and
maybe word will start to spread.
It's worth a shot, right?
Agil
950017_16_a
Agil, are you sure about this?
I don't want to impose...
Rain
950017_15_a
Dude, seriously?!
I don't remember a thing!
Klein
950017_14_a
You do! Every week!
Agil
950017_13_a
Karaoke? In your place?
Who even does that?
Klein
950017_12_a
It mostly gets used by my tipsier
patrons in spontaneous acts of
karaoke cruelty.
Agil
950017_11_a
Why not come sing at my place?
The cafe's got all the audio
equipment you need for a concert.
Agil
950017_10_a
What's up?
Rain
950017_9_a
Oh... Oh yeah!
Agil
950017_8_a
Oh quiet, you! You're one to talk!
Agil
950017_7_a
Hey, Agil. Smooth, man.
Smooth.
Klein
950017_6_a
but none of them have
led to anything.
Rain
950017_5_a
Not great. I've had a couple of
auditions so far,
Rain
950017_4_a
Klein
950017_3_a
Rain
950017_2_a
bg_10_field
So yeah, changing the subject...
How's your real-life singing
career shaping up?
Agil
950017_1_a
Hehe, it's okay. The short of the
matter is, I've dealt with my loss
in my own way. Now let's move on!
Rain
950015_24_a
You were the one who brought it
up in the first place!
Agil
950015_23_a
Can we PLEASE change the subject
now? This whole conversation's
gotten disgustingly sappy.
Klein
950015_22_a
I understand. We all met people
we cared for in SAO, people who
changed our lives.
Agil
950015_21_a
But my master, she was really
confident and strong...
I looked up to her.
Rain
950015_20_a
My mom was a really timid person.
She never stood up for herself.
Rain
950015_19_a
You know, she was around the same
age as my mom, but they were
nothing alike...
Rain
950015_18_a
It was part of the story. Once her
apprentice
got good enough,
she was programmed to die.
Rain
950015_17_a
Yeah... She got sick, and she...
She died.
Rain
950015_16_a
What do you mean?
Agil
950015_15_a
So when I was picking my race,
I thought I'd honor her memory,
so to speak.
Rain
950015_14_a
And I've told Kirito this before,
but back in SAO, an NPC blacksmith
sort of took me under her wing.
Rain
950015_13_a
There's no way I could compete
against her, so I decided to
carve out my own ALO niche.
Rain
950015_12_a
But when I found out Seven was a
Pooka, I changed my mind.
Rain
950015_11_a
I was planning on picking Pooka...
Rain
950015_10_a
So why aren't you a Pooka, Rain?
You like singing and stuff, right?
Klein
950015_9_a
Yeah, she told me you were busy.
Agil
950015_8_a
I could've been Seven's bodyguard,
but she had already asked you,
so I sat this one out.
Rain
950015_7_a
I wasn't there because I'm not a
Pooka, remember? It's not like
I needed to test song buffs.
Rain
950015_6_a
Oh yeah, my sister said you guys
helped her do some testing.
Rain
950015_5_a
Why weren't you there, Rain?
Klein
950015_4_a
Agil
950015_3_a
Rain
950015_2_a
bg_10_field
You know, I've been thinking...
We helped Seven out with her Pooka
stuff the other day, right?
Klein
950015_1_a
Yeah, right. Don't put me on the
same level as you, Klein.
Agil
950013_17_a
Man, Agil, look who's trying to
act all cool. Rain, don't fall
for it! It's an act!
Klein
950013_16_a
Oh my gosh! Thank you!
Rain
950013_15_a
You're representing the crafting
class. There's a lot to learn, but
I'm happy to share what I can.
Agil
950013_14_a
Yeah, sure. You need to know the
ins and outs of items and mats if
you want to be a good Leprechaun.
Agil
950013_13_a
You'll take me under your wing?!
Really?!
Rain
950013_12_a
I see... Hey, I've got an idea.
Want to be my apprentice?
Agil
950013_11_a
I only really started learning
about them after I picked a
Leprechaun here in ALO.
Rain
950013_10_a
I wasn't very sociable in SAO, so
I didn't have many opportunities
to gossip about items.
Rain
950013_9_a
Well, you're not wrong...
Agil
950013_8_a
Agil's been running item shops
since SAO day one, so he's racked
up tons of experience with items.
Klein
950013_7_a
Ouch... I can't deny that.
Rain
950013_6_a
I think you're more of an outlier
than I am. You're a pretty poor
excuse for a Leprechaun.
Agil
950013_5_a
Really? I wouldn't say I know more
than most people...
Agil
950013_4_a
Klein
950013_3_a
Agil
950013_2_a
bg_10_field
Agil, I'm really impressed by how
knowledgeable you are about items
and materials.
Rain
950013_1_a
Then stop talking and come on.
Agil
950011_28_a
HEY! I never said I wasn't coming!
Klein
950011_27_a
Right, sure. Have fun with that.
Agil
950011_26_a
H-Hey, I resent that!
I'm popular! I have parties
to go to! People to see!
Klein
950011_25_a
Not at all. Hey, Klein. You've got
nothing better to do. Back us up.
Agil
950011_24_a
Sure, I'd love to!
Do you mind?
Rain
950011_23_a
So how about you and me party up
and give it a go?
Agil
950011_22_a
Hey, you're in luck. I'm after it
myself. The items we need are the
reward for a newly added quest.
Agil
950011_21_a
So that's why I can't find it...
Rain
950011_20_a
So if you want to get your hands
on that material, you'll have to
craft it.
Agil
950011_19_a
Klein
950011_18_a
Rain
950011_17_a
So that's what you're after...
Well, it's not a monster drop,
and you can't mine for it.
Agil
950011_16_a
Excuse me? If you're going to
fight, can you do it after I've
asked my question?
Rain
950011_15_a
You wanna throw down?!
Bring it on!
Klein
950011_14_a
Junk?! Why I oughta...!
Agil
950011_13_a
Hah! You owe me for all the weird
junk you made me buy from you
back in SAO!
Klein
950011_12_a
I let you hang out in my place,
and this is how you repay me?
I should charge you rent.
Agil
950011_11_a
Ahaha, thanks for the warning.
Rain
950011_10_a
He'll wheedle you out of your
purse, your sword, and your house
in the blink of an eye.
Klein
950011_9_a
Agil here's a real fast talker.
It doesn't matter if you're here
to buy or not.
Klein
950011_8_a
Heh, watch your wallet there,
Rain.
Klein
950011_7_a
Not buying anything, huh?
Agil
950011_6_a
I'll pass! I'm not here to shop!
I'm here to ask you a question.
Rain
950011_5_a
Oh, hey there, Rain. I've got
tons of goodies on sale today.
Why not buy a few for the road?
Agil
950011_4_a
Klein
950011_3_a
Agil
950011_2_a
bg_05_agil_shop
Agil!
Rain
950011_1_a
I appreciate it, Kirito.
Agil
940018_20_a
Me too. You're always helping me
out, so anything you need,
just ask.
Kirito
940018_19_a
and as a merchant, I want to do
everything I can to make
that happen.
Agil
940018_18_a
Yeah. As a player,
Agil
940018_17_a
That's exactly why we have to get
through this floating castle as
quickly as possible.
Kirito
940018_16_a
Times like these tend to draw out
the worst in people.
Agil
940018_15_a
People are normally pretty decent,
but decency tends to get lost when
life and death are on the line.
Agil
940018_14_a
It's because all you can do is
trust in other players' morality.
Agil
940018_13_a
But I guess not having rules or
laws in place for situations like
this makes things kind of hairy.
Kirito
940018_12_a
That's what got you into
this mess in the first place...
Kirito
940018_11_a
if I do say so myself. Bahaha!
Agil
940018_10_a
My items ARE the best around,
Agil
940018_9_a
They were more concerned with
luring my customers away from me.
Agil
940018_8_a
But they must have known they'd
get found out in the end.
Kirito
940018_7_a
It takes a special kind of
determination to willingly put
yourself in the red like that.
Agil
940018_6_a
Part of me grudgingly admires the
lengths they went through to try
and destroy a competitor.
Agil
940018_5_a
Yeah.
Kirito
940018_4_a
Yeah. Looks like they were sorry
about it too.
Agil
940018_3_a
Agil
940018_2_a
bg_05_agil_shop
Well, I guess that's settled then.
Kirito
940018_1_a
Yeah, I've got your back.
Kirito
940017_19_a
You with me, Kirito?
Agil
940017_18_a
They're about to find out what
happens when you mess with
an Assault Team player.
Agil
940017_17_a
Being intimidating comes in handy
when things like this happen.
Agil
940017_16_a
Agil, you're kind of intimidating
right now...!
Kirito
940017_15_a
And you know, I never did say
I'd turn a blind eye to what's
been done to me.
Agil
940017_14_a
Geez, old people can be MEAN.
Kirito
940017_13_a
Heh, maybe a little kid like you
still has trouble understanding
these kinds of things.
Agil
940017_12_a
That's a mature way
of looking at it...
Kirito
940017_11_a
That happens in reality all the
time. To a certain extent.
Agil
940017_10_a
Destroying your competitors,
stealing their customers...
Agil
940017_9_a
No, it's not that...
Everyone's just trying to make
their own way in this world.
Agil
940017_8_a
It's like being stabbed in the
back... Maybe we shouldn't
have come after all.
Kirito
940017_7_a
This player was only pretending
to be a loyal customer of mine,
but was spreading these rumors...
Agil
940017_6_a
Something's bugging me...
Agil
940017_5_a
According to what we were told,
this shop just opened.
Kirito
940017_4_a
Yeah, just like you thought.
Agil
940017_3_a
Agil
940017_2_a
bg_04_town_inn
This must be it.
Kirito
940017_1_a
Ah...!
Kirito
940015_21_a
Now that I think about it,
I haven't seen them at all lately.
Agil
940015_20_a
What is it?
Kirito
940015_19_a
Huh...
Agil
940015_18_a
They're a regular, but even for a
regular, they've been coming here
a lot in the past few months...
Agil
940015_17_a
No, you don't.
Agil
940015_16_a
Do I know the player who told you
about the rumors?
Kirito
940015_15_a
I guess so.
Agil
940015_14_a
But we won't know the truth unless
we see it for ourselves, right?
Kirito
940015_13_a
I definitely believe a player, or
maybe even a group of players,
is reselling your items.
Kirito
940015_12_a
It's about that regular who told
you about the rumor.
Kirito
940015_11_a
So, what did you want to ask me?
Agil
940015_10_a
I just-
Kirito
940015_9_a
Oh, I'm "greedy," am I?
...Hahaha, I appreciate your
concern.
Agil
940015_8_a
I mean, you can get pretty greedy,
so it's not impossible that someone
could run you out of business.
Kirito
940015_7_a
I'm not worried! Just, regulars
like me would be in a bind if
your shop was forced to close.
Kirito
940015_6_a
I told you, you don't have to
worry about it.
Agil
940015_5_a
Yeah, that.
Kirito
940015_4_a
Earlier...? Oh, you mean the
player who's underselling me?
Agil
940015_3_a
No, there's just something I want
to ask you. About earlier.
Kirito
940015_2_a
bg_05_agil_shop
Back already, Kirito?
Did you forget something?
Agil
940015_1_a
Yeah, that's priority number one.
Kirito
940013_22_a
then we need to go talk to the
regular who said they heard
those rumors.
Asuna
940013_21_a
If we're serious about
looking into this,
Asuna
940013_20_a
No one's actually found a player
selling his items at a cheaper
rate.
Kirito
940013_19_a
I suppose, but all Agil's been
getting is hearsay.
Kirito
940013_18_a
What? If the situation is bad
enough to warrant rumors, then
there must be a criminal, right?
Asuna
940013_17_a
Yeah...
Huh? "Criminal"?
Kirito
940013_16_a
then they should definitely be
suffering losses...
Asuna
940013_15_a
At any rate... If we assume that
the criminal buys things directly
from Agil's shop,
Asuna
940013_14_a
Y-Yes, ma'am.
Kirito
940013_13_a
Fine, but no more jokes.
Asuna
940013_12_a
A-Alright, alright, I'm sorry!
I was just joking, so can you
put that rapier away?
Kirito
940013_11_a
Kirito, you are so lucky we're in
the safe zone right now.
Asuna
940013_10_a
Asuna, what if GHOSTS are behind
this, heh heh!
Kirito
940013_9_a
Weird is right...
Kirito
940013_8_a
But something definitely feels...
weird.
Asuna
940013_7_a
Don't worry about it. Thanks for
hearing me out at least.
Kirito
940013_6_a
No, I can't say I have. Sorry...
Asuna
940013_5_a
Have you heard anything
about that, Asuna?
Kirito
940013_4_a
Someone reselling Agil's goods...
Asuna
940013_3_a
Asuna
940013_2_a
bg_03_pub
...So that's what's going on.
Kirito
940013_1_a
Thanks, that'd be a big help.
Agil
940011_31_a
No, this is really shady.
If I hear any other rumors,
I'll be sure to let you know.
Kirito
940011_30_a
It's nothing you need to worry
about. Just forget it.
Agil
940011_29_a
I see...
Kirito
940011_28_a
That's what one of my regulars
told me, anyway.
Agil
940011_27_a
But there are items you can only
buy here that people are getting
for cheap.
Agil
940011_26_a
It hasn't gotten that bad yet,
thankfully.
Agil
940011_25_a
But couldn't it hurt you?
If they're underselling you,
won't they steal your customers?
Kirito
940011_24_a
I'm not in any sort of trouble,
but I just have this uneasy
feeling.
Agil
940011_23_a
Yeah. And it's not like it's
hurting me or anything.
Agil
940011_22_a
That is really odd.
Kirito
940011_21_a
Beats me.
Agil
940011_20_a
Why would they purposefully
lose money?
Kirito
940011_19_a
Exactly.
Agil
940011_18_a
But then they aren't making
any profit!
Kirito
940011_17_a
And what's more is they're
totally undercutting me.
Agil
940011_16_a
I don't know why, but someone
is definitely buying items here
and immediately reselling them.
Agil
940011_15_a
They aren't?
Kirito
940011_14_a
It wouldn't be so bad if the items
were getting to players who
can't come to the shop, but...
Agil
940011_13_a
Well, 'black market' isn't exactly
right. It's not like what they're
doing is illegal or anything...
Agil
940011_12_a
That's awful!
Kirito
940011_11_a
It seems someone's selling
items they buy from me
on the black market.
Agil
940011_10_a
Er, well...
It's nothing, really, but...
Agil
940011_9_a
Did something happen?
Kirito
940011_8_a
...
Kirito
940011_7_a
Oh, you know... Not terrible.
Agil
940011_6_a
How're things with the shop going?
Kirito
940011_5_a
Coming right up.
Agil
940011_4_a
I need to restock my potions.
Can I get the usual?
Kirito
940011_3_a
Welcome!
Oh, hey there, Kirito!
Agil
940011_2_a
bg_05_agil_shop
Hey, Agil.
Kirito
940011_1_a
Ha ha ha!
Asuna
850118_22_a
That was so lame, Daddy!
Yui
850118_21_a
We put both arms out for balance,
and... WAH!
Kirito
850118_20_a
You got it! Watch this...
Kirito
850118_19_a
Show me the coolest way to ride
a unicycle, Daddy!
Yui
850118_18_a
Ha ha ha!
You're certainly not wrong!
Kirito
850118_17_a
Ha ha, you look like a dad trying
to teach his kid to ride a bike!
Asuna
850118_16_a
Okay, good idea!
Yui
850118_15_a
You might pick up on something
new by watching someone else
ride.
Kirito
850118_14_a
Great! Okay, now it's my turn.
Kirito
850118_13_a
Yes! I want to get better so I
can help everyone!
Yui
850118_12_a
I do. So what do you think?
Are you going to stick with it?
Kirito
850118_11_a
You really think so?
Yui
850118_10_a
Yeah! You look way more
comfortable than when you
first got on it.
Asuna
850118_9_a
You're getting a lot better,
though!
Kirito
850118_8_a
I-I'm fine. This is really hard!
Yui
850118_7_a
Yui! Are you okay?!
Asuna
850118_6_a
Eep! Ahh!
Yui
850118_5_a
There you go! Hang in there!
You can do it!
Kirito
850118_4_a
Asuna
850118_3_a
Kirito
850118_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
I just need to...
Whoa!
Yui
850118_1_a
Ooh, okay! I'll try it!
Yui
850117_23_a
Not to mention mastering this
should make you way faster on
the battlefield.
Kirito
850117_22_a
Children tend to have better
balance than adults, anyway.
Kirito
850117_21_a
A lot of children who perform with
the circus ride them.
Kirito
850117_20_a
Do you think you can ride it?
Kirito
850117_19_a
We convinced the circus troupe to
give it to us.
Asuna
850117_18_a
It's a unicycle.
Kirito
850117_17_a
Asuna
850117_16_a
Kirito
850117_15_a
What's this?
Yui
850117_14_a
How about this?
Kirito
850117_13_a
What? What'd you come up with?
Asuna
850117_12_a
Oh man, that's it!
Kirito
850117_11_a
I wonder if there's a way she
could put her training to good
use.
Kirito
850117_10_a
Right. She's all in on the idea.
Kirito
850117_9_a
I know... But we can't very well
tell her to stop at this point
either.
Asuna
850117_8_a
she'll never be as fast as the
other fairies who can fly.
Kirito
850117_7_a
It's kind of a shame, isn't it?
No matter how hard she tries,
or how fast she gets,
Kirito
850117_6_a
Well, she did a ton of training
today.
Kirito
850117_5_a
She's sleeping like a rock.
I guess she was tired!
Asuna
850117_4_a
Kirito
850117_3_a
Asuna
850117_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Zzz... Zzz...
Yui
850117_1_a
Alright then, Yui. Go for it.
Kirito
850115_20_a
but I might also find a new way
to get stronger. At least, that's
what I think.
Yui
850115_19_a
So please let me practice. I may
not get that good in the end,
Yui
850115_18_a
Hah, fair point.
Kirito
850115_17_a
Heh heh, that's what I told you,
Daddy!
Yui
850115_16_a
That's why you're doing all this?
You don't need to worry about
all that stuff!
Kirito
850115_15_a
But Yui...
Asuna
850115_14_a
So I've determined that the only
way to get stronger is through
exercise.
Yui
850115_13_a
Its stats are also quite weak
overall.
Yui
850115_12_a
My combat avatar can't fly like
my pixie avatar can.
Yui
850115_11_a
What do you mean by that?
Kirito
850115_10_a
Moves that I can use to help you
out more.
Yui
850115_9_a
Besides, I want to learn some
acrobatic moves.
Yui
850115_8_a
But Yui...
Asuna
850115_7_a
It is impossible for me to train
too much. My body will not
undergo any changes.
Yui
850115_6_a
But you don't need to be.
Yui
850115_5_a
I see. I understand that you are
concerned for me.
Yui
850115_4_a
Asuna
850115_3_a
Yui
850115_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
You can say that again.
Kirito
850115_1_a
Kirito
850113_27_a
Yeah, we really shouldn't push
her.
Asuna
850113_26_a
Owww!
Yui
850113_25_a
Asuna
850113_24_a
Whoops, she fell out of the tree.
Kirito
850113_23_a
Oof!
Yui
850113_22_a
Kirito
850113_21_a
Heh heh, you've got me there.
Asuna
850113_20_a
Wait, what? You're worried about
the exact same thing!
Kirito
850113_19_a
Now you're just being
overprotective.
Asuna
850113_18_a
and we shouldn't push her when
she's still so young.
Kirito
850113_17_a
You might be right. There aren't
many troupes for her to join,
Kirito
850113_16_a
She'll never make it in that
sphere.
Asuna
850113_15_a
Like you said, all of the truly
incredible acrobatic talents
are adults.
Asuna
850113_14_a
True.
Kirito
850113_13_a
She's just not that strong.
Asuna
850113_12_a
And combat-ready or not, she's
still using a child's avatar. 
Asuna
850113_11_a
Your stats don't really change in
ALO, no matter how much you
practice.
Asuna
850113_10_a
...
Kirito
850113_9_a
That's what worries me...
Asuna
850113_8_a
Asuna
850113_7_a
Hmm, I don't think Yui will go
for that. She clearly wants to
do some sort of acrobatics.
Kirito
850113_6_a
Hyah! Hmph!
Yui
850113_5_a
Kirito
850113_4_a
Sometimes, but I've only ever
seen them directing the low-risk
animal performances.
Asuna
850113_3_a
Asuna
850113_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
Wait, don't a lot of kids direct
the animal acts in the circus?
Kirito
850113_1_a
Not really, no. It's mostly an
adult thing in Japan. Some kids
in China perform, though.
Kirito
850111_13_a
You don't really hear about any
kids actually joining the circus,
though, do you?
Asuna
850111_12_a
Ha ha, I guess so.
Kirito
850111_11_a
Ha ha, so you're living out your
dreams in VRMMOs now?
Asuna
850111_10_a
They moved like ninjas, and what
kid doesn't want to be a ninja?
They're just so cool!
Kirito
850111_9_a
That's for sure. I remember
wanting to join the circus as
a kid too.
Kirito
850111_8_a
Seems like it! She's just like
any other kid in that regard.
Asuna
850111_7_a
Think that inspired her to put on
her own act?
Kirito
850111_6_a
Hah, well, she did go see Sugu's
performance with us.
Kirito
850111_5_a
She says it's circus practice!
She's leaping from tree to tree
like she's in a trapeze act.
Asuna
850111_4_a
Asuna
850111_3_a
What're you doing there, Yui?
Kirito
850111_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
Hah! Yah!
Yui
850111_1_a
Well, it was absolutely amazing.
Thanks, guys.
Kirito

850078_39_a
Pina
850078_38_a
We put our heads together!
Silica
850078_37_a
How did you even come up
with something like this?
Kirito
850078_36_a
Pina
850078_35_a
Silica
850078_34_a
Heh heh! I had a feeling you
might like it.
Liz
850078_33_a
The heat kicks in and blends with
the lingering sweetness... This is
some really fantastic chocolate!
Kirito
850078_32_a
Yeah, it's really good. It's not
what I expected, but man,
I could get addicted to this.
Kirito
850078_31_a
Liz
850078_30_a
Pina
850078_29_a
Y-Yes! D-Do you like it?
Silica
850078_28_a
It's supposed to be spicy, right?!
Kirito
850078_27_a
Wh-Whoa! It's spicy!
Kirito
850078_26_a
...Wait, what's that aftertaste?
Kirito
850078_25_a

850078_20_a
Mmm... It's not too sweet,
and just a little bitter...
It's pretty tasty, actually.
Kirito
850078_19_a
Thanks! 
chomp
Kirito
850078_18_a

Pina
850078_16_a
Y-Yes! Please go ahead!
Silica
850078_15_a
Well, I really appreciate it.
Is it okay if I taste it now?
Kirito
850078_14_a
Silica
850078_13_a
But it took a little trial and
error, and we only had enough
ingredients for the one piece.
Liz
850078_12_a
Well... We originally wanted to
each make a piece for you.
Liz
850078_9_a
Pina
850078_11_a
Silica
850078_10_a
So you guys made it together?
Kirito
850078_8_a
R-Right! Sure...
Thanks, you two...
Kirito
850078_7_a
Silica
850078_6_a
We poured our hearts and souls
into that chocolate. So you better
be grateful.
Liz
850078_5_a

Valentine's Chocolate?
For me?
Kirito
850078_1_a
Yeah! We are SO doing this!
Liz
850077_18_a
Right! It'll be tough working
without a recipe, but now I
want to see what we can do!
Silica
850077_17_a
Obviously we don't want to
overdo it, but a little chili will
give it a special kick!
Liz
850077_16_a
W-Well, if you put it that way...
Silica
850077_15_a
Chili chocolate is popular in
some parts of the real world.
I'm sure it'll be a hit here too!
Liz
850077_14_a
Really? I didn't know that...
Silica
850077_13_a
Heh heh! You'd be surprised.
Chili chocolate is indeed a thing.
Liz
850077_12_a
Y-Yeah, but still! That's doesn't
mean it'll taste good in
chocolate!
Silica
850077_11_a
Yeah! After all, Kirito loves
spicy food, doesn't he?
Liz
850077_10_a
Ch-Chili peppers?!
As in red hot chili peppers?!
Silica
850077_9_a
The kind...with chili peppers.
Liz
850077_8_a
B-But what kind of chocolate
are we making?
Silica
850077_7_a
Aw, rats. Nothing... Then I guess
we'll have to come up with it
ourselves...
Liz
850077_6_a
Hmmm...
Liz
850077_5_a
Look, there should be something
like it here on your list.
Liz
850077_4_a

850077_3_a
Pina
850077_2_a
bg_03_pub
Really...?
Silica
850077_1_a
The perfect idea!
Liz
850075_19_a
H-Huh? Got what?
Silica
850075_18_a
Actually, I bet he'd like
something like... I've got it!
Liz
850075_17_a
Well, sure, but that doesn't
necessarily mean he hates sweets.
Liz
850075_16_a
So I figured he might like this
type of chocolate.
Silica
850075_15_a
Hehe... Well, Kirito does like
the color black...
Silica
850075_14_a
I bet it's insanely bitter.
Liz
850075_13_a
Whoaaa... Look at this one!
How much more black could it be?
Liz
850075_12_a
Yes. I've got this list
of different chocolates...
Silica
850075_11_a
I see... Well, did you have
anything in mind?
Liz
850075_10_a
Thanks, Liz! That's a great idea!
I was just trying to figure that
out myself...
Silica
850075_9_a
So rather than talking in circles,
let's put our heads together and
puzzle out what he might like.
Liz
850075_8_a
And so do you!
Silica
850075_7_a
R-Right. I want to give
Kirito a Valentine's gift...
Silica
850075_6_a
Well, that's enough silliness.
We seem to want the same thing.
Liz
850075_5_a
Hehehe!

Silica
850073_19_a
...
Liz
850073_18_a
Th-That's how I feel too!
I want to give Kirito something
special...as a friend, I mean...
Silica
850073_17_a
So we might as well give him
some really nice chocolate, right?
Liz
850073_16_a
Y-Yeah, precisely! He's always
helping us out, after all.
Liz
850073_15_a
I-I-I've been thinking the same
thing! I want to show my thanks
to Kirito! As a friend!
Silica
850073_14_a
What?! I mean, well, yeah, of
course I'll give him chocolate...
as a f-friend...
Liz
850073_13_a
So...
That includes Kirito, right?
Silica
850073_12_a
Uh, s-sure. I mean, I wouldn't
want anyone feeling left out.
Liz
850073_11_a
L-Liz! What about you?
You're going to make chocolate
for everyone too, right?
Silica
850073_10_a
Um... Well...
Silica
850073_9_a
R-Right. So, in other words,
it's all going to be friend
chocolate...?
Liz
850073_8_a
It's just a little something to
let them know how much I
appreciate them...
Silica
850073_7_a
O-Of course! I'm making enough
for everyone I know!
Silica
850073_6_a
S-So, you're making chocolate...
for all of your friends, right?
Liz

Y-Yeah...
Silica
850071_18_a
Y-Yeah, I guess so. Is that why
you're here?
Liz
850071_17_a
Oh, hi Liz. Did you come here
to make chocolate too?
Silica
850071_16_a
Pina
850071_15_a
Hey, Silica.
Liz
850071_14_a
Hmm? What's wrong, Pina?
Silica
850071_13_a
Chiiiirp!
Pina
850071_12_a
I was just looking at the list and
wondering which kind I should
make.
Silica
850071_11_a
Plus, there are a ton of different
varieties of Salamander Fire
Chocolate.
Silica
850071_10_a
They said it's really delicious,
melts in your mouth, and just
warms you up!
Silica
850071_9_a
Asuna and Yuuki called it,
uh...Salamander Fire Chocolate.
Silica
850071_8_a
You know, we can make really
special chocolate here in
Salamander territory.
Silica
850071_7_a
Hehe, maybe raw cacao beans
are more your thing, huh?
Silica
850071_6_a
Chirp...
Pina
850071_5_a
Look at this list of chocolates,
Pina... Don't they all look super
tasty?
Silica
850071_4_a
Chirp?
Pina
850071_3_a
Pina
850071_2_a
bg_03_pub
Hmmm... This is amazing!
Silica
850071_1_a
Chirp!
Pina
850068_31_a
Oh, Pina, what am I gonna do with
you? Okay, we'll go see the dragon
again once we're stronger.
Silica
850068_30_a
Silica
850068_29_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
850068_28_a
Asuna
850068_27_a
Ha ha, I think Pina might want to
grow up to BE that dragon!
Yuuki
850068_26_a
Chirp!
Pina
850068_25_a
What's that, Pina? You want to
see the dragon again too?
Silica
850068_24_a
Silica
850068_23_a
Chiiiirp!
Pina
850068_22_a
Yeah, I'm sure he would!
Yuuki
850068_21_a
I know Kirito would be on board
with that plan.
Asuna
850068_20_a
but I'd like to get a raid party
together and take a run at it
once we get our feet under us.
Asuna
850068_19_a
Yuuki
850068_18_a
Well, we might have a long way to
go, seeing as we're still newbies,
Asuna
850068_17_a
Pina
850068_16_a
You just like combat, don't you?
Silica
850068_15_a
Asuna
850068_14_a
Aw, c'mon! Fighting all the bosses
is the whole point of playing a
game like this!
Yuuki
850068_13_a
Pina
850068_12_a
Ha ha, who said anything about
fighting it? Not me!
Silica
850068_11_a
Whew! Good thing we didn't fight
it, then. We've got a long way to
go before we take it on.
Yuuki
850068_10_a
Actually no, it's more like a
secret boss.
Asuna
850068_9_a
It looks like that dragon is a
final boss of sorts for this game.
Asuna
850068_8_a
Yuuki
850068_7_a
It sure sounds that way. I had
a look at the documentation
for Asuka Empire.
Asuna
850068_6_a
Pina
850068_5_a
It was very regal. It definitely
felt like a god.
Silica
850068_4_a
Yeah. We knew we didn't stand
a chance against it, heh.
Yuuki
850068_3_a
Yuuki
850068_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
And that's when you escaped?
Asuna
850068_1_a
Well, it IS a god...
Silica
850067_19_a
It talked!
Yuuki
850067_18_a
What pathetic creatures dare
disturb my slumber?
Dragon
850067_17_a
Chirp!!
Pina
850067_16_a
I-It's huge!
Silica
850067_15_a
Y-Yeah, that's the dragon alright!
Yuuki

Eep!

Silica, look up!
Yuuki
850067_11_a
What could those things possibly
be...afraid of...?
Silica
850067_10_a
They look as terrified as Pina...
Silica
850067_9_a
They're...running away?!
Yuuki

Rwaaaar!

Pina?

Huh? Why?

Pina

AHHH! And thundering!
Silica

bg_event_swamp
It's raining...
Yuuki
850065_23_a
What's wrong, Pina? Ah!
Silica
850065_22_a
Chirp?
Pina
850065_21_a
Is this really where the legendary
dragon lives?
Silica
850065_20_a
You're right about that.
They'd turn us into snacks
for sure.
Yuuki
850065_19_a
Either way, we're dead if we
get involved!
Silica
850065_18_a
Whoa, they're fighting each other!
Is this some sort of turf war?
Yuuki
850065_17_a
Pina
850065_16_a
Yuuki
850065_15_a
Look at that...

ROAAAAAAR!
Beast

Huh? Why?
Yuuki

Wah! Yuuki, hide!
Silica
850065_6_a
Yeah... At least, I think so.
Yuuki
850065_5_a
Is this where it lives?

Pina

Silica

bg_event_alo_cloudysky
...
Yuuki
850065_1_a
Totally! We're just gonna sneak
a look at it!
Yuuki
850063_19_a
All by ourselves?!
Are you sure about this?
Silica
850063_18_a
Enough talk! Let's go, Silica!
Yuuki
850063_17_a
I guess so, hehe.
Which just makes me want to see
it even more than I did before!
Yuuki
850063_16_a
So you're saying the dragon in
the mountains here is probably
one of the good, sacred ones?
Silica
850063_15_a
The differences in how they're
portrayed will be pretty obvious.
Yuuki
850063_14_a
And if you're still confused,
just crack open any collection
of dragon illustrations.
Yuuki
850063_13_a
Not to mention most Western
religions have just one god, so
dragons were beasts, not gods.
Yuuki
850063_12_a
Ah, good vs. evil.
Yeah, that's about as
opposite as you can get.
Silica
850063_11_a
But dragons in European fantasy
were just another evil creature,
like demons or goblins.
Yuuki
850063_10_a
Well, the East Asian dragon was
originally the physical form of a
god in the Chinese zodiac.
Yuuki
850063_9_a
So this dragon is totally
different from the European style?
Silica
850063_8_a
It is, but it's not like it's the
king of dragons or anything.
Its existence itself is legendary.
Yuuki
850063_7_a
Eep! It sounds powerful.
Silica
850063_6_a
That there's a legendary dragon
living up in the mountains.
Yuuki
850063_5_a
What rumor is that?
Silica
850063_4_a
Pina
850063_3_a
Silica
850063_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Oh yeah! All this reminds me of a
rumor I heard last time I played
Asuka Empire.
Yuuki
850063_1_a
Chirp?
Pina
850061_21_a
Ahh, I see what you mean.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Silica
850061_20_a
This seems like the kind of game
where dragons would look more like
giant serpents. That make sense?
Yuuki
850061_19_a
See what I'm saying? All
wings and horns in a Japanese-
themed VRMMO.
Yuuki
850061_18_a
I just mean that Pina's got a
kind of European fantasy look.
Yuuki
850061_17_a
Why is that strange?
Silica
850061_16_a
You're welcome! Though I find
it strange that Pina looks no
different from back in ALO.
Yuuki
850061_15_a
Pina says thank you too!
Silica
850061_14_a
Chirp!
Pina
850061_13_a
Hehe, I appreciate the compliment.
Silica
850061_12_a
I bet that's what led you to
choose Beastmaster. How could
you choose anything else?
Yuuki
850061_11_a
Heh, I don't buy that. Consciously
or not, you're always thinking
about Pina.
Yuuki
850061_10_a
I wasn't even thinking about that
at the time! It was pure luck.
Silica
850061_9_a
And thank goodness I did.
Pina wouldn't be able to follow
me around if I hadn't!
Silica
850061_8_a
I know! I chose Beastmaster
the second I saw it on the job
selection screen.
Silica
850061_7_a
You know, it's great that you
were actually able to bring Pina
over to Asuka Empire, Silica!
Yuuki
850061_6_a
Chirp!
Pina
850061_5_a
You're looking energetic today,
Pina!
Yuuki

Pina

Ha ha, I guess so!

And now we know where they live!
The poachers were good for
something after all.

save the reindeer!

attack for you! You're not going
anywhere!

Gah, hey! I-I can't move!

You're up, Pina!

They're on to us! Run!

That's why you were using hiding
magic and stealth skills.
Sinon

850058_11_a
Where the hell did you guys
come from?!
NPC
850058_10_a
Liz
850058_9_a
That was pretty amazing, Yuuki.
Sinon
850058_8_a
Whew! I thought chopping arrows
out of the sky was easier than
magic, but it's no joke!
Yuuki
850058_7_a
I did it! Oh man, I must've looked
like Kirito just now!
Yuuki
850058_6_a
What the hell?!
NPC
850058_5_a
HYAH!
Yuuki
850058_4_a
Yuuki
850058_3_a
Say goodnight!
NPC
850058_2_a
bg_03_forest_snow
Don't you worry, I've got my
paralyzing arrow ready to go...!
NPC
850058_1_a
Let's kill 'em and get outta this
frozen wasteland!
NPC
850057_20_a
Heh heh... Those antlers and that
meat'll fetch a pretty penny on
the black market!
NPC
850057_19_a
Alright, we've found our herd!
NPC
850057_18_a
Yuuki
850057_17_a
Right! They seemed to be on the
trail of one. Let's follow them!
Silica
850057_16_a
Then we better find a herd,
quick!
Liz
850057_15_a
Liz
850057_14_a
We can't prove they're poachers
unless we catch them in the act.
Sinon
850057_13_a
Aw yeah, stuff like this really
gets the blood pumping!
But how do we stop them?
Yuuki
850057_12_a
Yuuki
850057_11_a
I won't let those poachers get
away with this! We Cait Sith share
a bond with all living creatures!
Silica
850057_10_a
Sounds like we've found ourselves
a quest. How about it, guys?
Liz
850057_9_a
Liz
850057_8_a
That makes them poachers.
Sinon
850057_7_a
There aren't that many of them.
Silica
850057_6_a
No. Agil says reindeer hunting is
forbidden in Gnome territory.
Silica
850057_5_a
Can they do that?
Yuuki
850057_4_a
They must be. Their faces lit up
when we told them that's what
we were here to see.
Silica
850057_3_a
Silica
850057_2_a
bg_03_forest_snow
Wait, so they're out here hunting
reindeer?
Yuuki
850057_1_a
They were checking out sight lines
and trying to conceal themselves.
Sinon
850055_35_a
Liz
850055_34_a
I'm a sniper, remember?
It takes one to know one.
Sinon
850055_33_a
Yuuki
850055_32_a
H-How could you tell?!
Silica
850055_31_a
They're hunters.
Sinon
850055_30_a
Sinon
850055_29_a
Okay, good. I'm glad I'm not the
only one who thought they were
super shady.
Liz
850055_28_a
There they go.
Some "travelers," huh?
Yuuki
850055_27_a
Oh, okay...
Silica
850055_26_a
They travel in packs, so keep an
eye out and keep your distance.
They're pretty dangerous.
NPC
850055_25_a
Hehe, is that so?
Well then...
NPC
850055_24_a
Oho!
NPC
850055_23_a
Oh, no, not really. We've just
come to see the reindeer!
Silica
850055_22_a
Are you on a journey of your own?
NPC
850055_21_a
Silica
850055_20_a
Uh, us? We're just travelers.
NPC
850055_19_a
Liz
850055_18_a
If I had to guess...
No, you know what? Let's
just go talk to them.
Sinon
850055_17_a
Sinon
850055_16_a
They're not players, though.
They're NPCs, which makes
this whole thing weirder.
Liz
850055_15_a
Do you think they've come to
see the reindeer too?
Silica
850055_14_a
It looks like they're hiding in
the bushes and checking their
surroundings.
Silica
850055_13_a
Silica
850055_12_a
Really? Where?
Ah, now I see them.
Yuuki
850055_11_a
Not a reindeer. A person.
Three... No, four of them.
Sinon
850055_9_a
Liz
850055_10_a
Did you find a reindeer?
Silica
850055_8_a
Silica
850055_7_a
What is it, Sinon?
Yuuki
850055_6_a
Liz
850055_5_a
...Hold up.
Sinon
850055_4_a
Me neither.
We've looked all over, too.
Yuuki
850055_3_a
Yuuki
850055_2_a
bg_03_forest_snow
Huh. I don't see any reindeer.
Silica
850055_1_a
Sinon
850053_21_a
Oh man, now I really can't wait!
Yuuki
850053_20_a
Liz
850053_19_a
Absolutely!
Silica
850053_18_a
Yuuki
850053_17_a
Heh, fair point. We'll just have
to observe them in their natural
habitat.
Sinon
850053_16_a
ALO's a fantasy world, though.
These reindeer might fly, for all
we know.
Liz
850053_15_a
Liz
850053_14_a
Oh yeah, ha ha. I knew that...
Silica
850053_13_a
Only in stories about Santa Claus.
Real reindeer remain firmly on
the ground.
Sinon
850053_12_a
Sinon
850053_11_a
They fly, though, don't they?
Yuuki
850053_10_a
Uh, no, because they're real!
Liz
850053_9_a
Liz
850053_8_a
Wait, they're not like unicorns?
Or Pegasus?
Silica
850053_7_a
They're just one of those animals
people hear about all the time
but rarely get to see.
Sinon
850053_6_a
Sinon
850053_5_a
Liz is right. I can't help but get
excited, though! I've never
seen reindeer before!
Yuuki
850053_4_a
Luckily we're not in any hurry!
Liz
850053_3_a
Liz
850053_2_a
bg_03_forest_snow
I think we still have a ways to go
before we reach the reindeer...
Silica
850053_1_a
Good idea!
Silica
850051_23_a
Silica
850051_22_a
Well, then we'd better check in
with them and get the okay to go.
Yuuki
850051_21_a
Rain's helping Agil out since the
food got ruined 'n' all.
Liz
850051_20_a
Liz
850051_19_a
Heh, who knew he'd get so popular?
Sinon
850051_18_a
Kirito's tied up with his fans
after his latest great
performance.
Silica
850051_17_a
Silica
850051_16_a
Sounds good to me!
But what about Kirito
and Rain? Or even Agil?
Yuuki
850051_15_a
Besides, a nice long trip could
be fun!
Liz
850051_14_a
Might as well! 'Tis the season,
right?
Liz
850051_13_a
Liz
850051_12_a
Sure, I'll go.
Sinon
850051_11_a
This is our chance to see some
wild reindeer! Don't you want
to go?
Silica
850051_9_a
Yuuki
850051_10_a
Raises to pull his sleigh,
you mean.
Sinon
850051_8_a
Sinon
850051_7_a
Reindeer? Like, the kind that
Santa raises?
Liz
850051_6_a
Agil just told me all about it!
Silica
850051_5_a
There are reindeer living in the
southern part of Gnome territory!
Silica
850051_4_a
What's up, Silica?
Yuuki
850051_3_a
Yuuki
850051_2_a
bg_event_tree_snow_christmas
Guys, guys, guys!
Silica
850051_1_a
Chirp!!
Pina
850048_28_a
So never use it unless I say so,
got it?!
Silica
850048_27_a
Pina
850048_26_a
Hehe, good idea. Now, Pina!
I'll tell you when to use this
ability, okay?
Silica
850048_25_a
Maybe if you do that, figure out
the escape plan first?
Leafa
850048_24_a
Yeah! That'd be awesome!
Though, I guess you'd be totally
blinded by bubbles too...
Leafa
850048_23_a
Like, if you needed to run from a
monster! It'd be like a bubble
version of a smoke bomb!
Asuna
850048_22_a
Leafa
850048_21_a
Hehe, yeah, that was certainly
surprising. But I bet you can
find a use for it!
Asuna
850048_20_a
sigh
... Very well. You're off
the hook. But I did not expect
the hot spring buff to do that!
Silica
850048_19_a
Silica
850048_18_a
Chirp!
Pina
850048_17_a
Yeah, I bet making all those
bubbles was just too much fun to
stop. Happens to the best of us.
Leafa
850048_16_a
Leafa
850048_15_a
Now now, Silica, go easy on the
little cutie. I think Pina's sorry.
Asuna
850048_14_a
Chirp...
Pina
850048_13_a
Pina
850048_12_a
Pina! I'm very upset with you!
Never do that again!
Silica
850048_11_a
Phew... Finally...
Silica
850048_10_a
Chirp?! Chiiirp...!!
Pina
850048_9_a
Pina
850048_8_a
Piiinaaa!!
You get over here
right this instant!
Silica
850048_7_a
Chirp?
Pina
850048_6_a
Already on it!
Silica
850048_5_a
Now, Silica! Go go go!!
Leafa
850048_4_a
Nice one, Leafa! I think we
cleared the whole hot spring
of bubbles!
Asuna
850048_3_a
Pina
850048_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Hiyaaah!!
Leafa
850048_1_a
Already on it!
Leafa
850047_26_a
Here we go...
It's water time!!
Asuna
850047_25_a
Yeah, count me in!
Silica
850047_24_a
That's a good plan! Let's do it!
Asuna
850047_23_a
And while you and I keep the
bubbles at bay, Silica swoops
down and grabs Pina!
Leafa
850047_22_a
I mean, I'll use my wind magic to
blow the water from your spells
and sweep the entire hot spring!
Leafa
850047_21_a
Get...what?
Asuna
850047_20_a
Hold up... How about we combine
our magic, Asuna? You make water,
I spread it out.
Leafa
850047_19_a
And Pina just keeps making more
and more and more bubbles...
Silica
850047_18_a
Chiiirp! Chirp chirp! Chiiirp!
Pina
850047_17_a
My water magic isn't powerful
enough to push back those
bubbles...
Asuna
850047_16_a
I...see. Crazy.
Leafa
850047_15_a
A-Actually, the truth is...
Silica
850047_14_a
I heard the commotion, so I came
by to check it out. But I was NOT
prepared for all these bubbles!
Leafa
850047_13_a
Leafa!
Asuna
850047_12_a
Asuna
850047_11_a
Guys? What in the world's going
on here?
Leafa
850047_10_a
But what do we do now?
At this rate...
Silica
850047_9_a
N-No, don't worry about it!
You don't have to apologize!
Silica
850047_8_a
Sorry, Silica... I never learned
any spells that could make that
much water...
Asuna
850047_7_a
Rats... Pina's bubbles are too
powerful! If only I could hit the
whole hot spring at once...
Asuna
850047_6_a
Pina's buffed bubble powers are
totally overwhelming your water
spell, Asuna...
Silica
850047_5_a
N-No way...
Asuna
850047_4_a
Chirp, chirp! Chirp chiiirp!
Pina
850047_3_a
Silica
850047_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
Hraaagh!!
Asuna
850047_1_a
That's a great idea!
Go for it, Asuna!
Silica
850045_19_a
You got it! This is the perfect
chance to show off my Undine
skills!
Asuna
850045_18_a
Oh, of course! Water magic!
Silica
850045_17_a
We'll need a whole lot of water to
wash all those bubbles away...
So, leave it to me!
Asuna
850045_16_a
But look at all the soapsuds...
What do we do about this?
Silica
850045_15_a
Possible... Definitely possible...
Asuna
850045_14_a
It could have increased the power
of Pina's bubble attack.
Silica
850045_13_a
Yeah... Oh, maybe it was the hot
spring's buff?
Silica
850045_12_a
Even if that is what happened,
that's way too many bubbles...
Asuna
850045_11_a
Pina must have used a bubble
attack on the soap, and it all
just went "fwoosh"...
Silica
850045_10_a
How did it do that? I've never
seen anything make bubbles that
big.
Player B
850045_9_a
Yeah...
Silica
850045_8_a
Chirp chirp chiiirp!
Chirp chirp chiiirp!
Pina
850045_7_a
That little dragon over there is
yours, then?
Player A
850045_6_a
S-Sorry, everybody...
I should have been keeping a
better eye on my tamed monster...
Silica
850045_5_a
Well, that was surprising. I can't
believe the whole hot spring got
enveloped in a ball of bubbles.
Player B
850045_4_a
Y-Yeah... It's a good thing this
is ALO. Without wings, we would've
been caught in it.
Player A
850045_3_a
Silica
850045_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
I-Is everyone all right?
Asuna
850045_1_a
Wah! Aaaaaah!!
Silica
850043_22_a
Chiiiirp chirp CHIRP!
Pina
850043_21_a
Whoa, what is Pina doing?!
The soapsuds are turning into
a giant pile of bubbles!!
Asuna
850043_20_a
Hmm, what is it, Pina?
WAAAH!!
Silica
850043_19_a
Chirp! Chirp chirp!
Pina
850043_18_a
Good idea!
Silica
850043_17_a
Hmm... The buff might only affect
some hidden stat. You might want
to experiment a bit.
Asuna
850043_16_a
The stats all seem to be about
the same...
Silica
850043_15_a
Alright, let's see here...
Silica
850043_14_a
Ooh, now I'm curious too! Open up
Pina's status window and check!
Asuna
850043_13_a
Supposedly, it works on tamed
monsters too, so I wanted to test
it and see what happens.
Silica
850043_12_a
I heard a rumor that taking a dip
in them temporarily buffs your
stats!
Silica
850043_11_a
Well, I'm happy to do that, but
my main goal was the hot springs
themselves.
Silica
850043_10_a
So you came here today just to
introduce Pina to the joys of
cleanliness?
Asuna
850043_9_a
No. We played in the water a lot,
though. Pina really likes that.
Silica
850043_8_a
You never bathed with Pina in SAO?
Asuna
850043_7_a
You know, now that I think of it,
this might be the first time we've
ever taken a bath together.
Silica
850043_6_a
I guess Pina has a new favorite
toy.
Asuna
850043_5_a
Pina's playing with your bath
bubbles nonstop.
Silica
850043_4_a
Asuna
850043_3_a
Silica
850043_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Chirp! CHIRP!
Pina
850043_1_a
Yeah, wow! Someone's having fun.
Asuna
850041_17_a
Ahahaha! Pina seems really
fascinated with them!
Silica
850041_16_a
Chirp chirp?
Pina
850041_15_a
Here you go, Pina.
You like this?
Asuna
850041_14_a
Hehe, I'm not surprised! Pina
uses a bubble attack all the time,
after all!
Asuna
850041_13_a
Hehe, what is it, Pina? You're
staring at those bath bubbles
on Asuna reaaal hard.
Silica
850041_12_a
Chirp!
Pina
850041_11_a
Exactly!
Asuna
850041_10_a
Hehe, VR or not, you do feel nice
and refreshed after a good bath!
Silica
850041_9_a
But I just got in the habit from
my time in SAO. It made me feel
more...normal there.
Asuna
850041_8_a
Yeah, I know you don't actually
need to clean yourself here...
Asuna
850041_7_a
Asuna, why do you bother washing
up here in VR?
Silica
850041_6_a
Hehehe, you think so? I'm always
in a good mood during a bath!
Asuna
850041_5_a
You seem to be in a good mood
today, Asuna.
Silica
850041_4_a
Pina
850041_3_a
Silica
850041_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Dum dee dum dee dooo!
Asuna
850041_1_a
Whatever it is, I'll do my best
to give it to you!
Asuna
850038_18_a
I'm glad to hear it!
Asuna
850038_17_a
...or whether I want to be doted
on when I don't feel good,
I'll always tell you!
Yui
850038_16_a
Whether I want to eat lunch right
away without waiting...
Yui
850038_15_a
Okay... I promise!
Yui
850038_14_a
Promise me?
Asuna
850038_13_a
Mommy...
Yui
850038_12_a
Never hesitate to tell us what you
want, when you want it.
Asuna
850038_11_a
Please don't hold back with me and
Kirito again, okay?
Asuna
850038_10_a
Of course... What is it?
Yui
850038_9_a
But can you promise me one
thing, Yui?
Asuna
850038_8_a
Hehe, that's good to hear.
Asuna
850038_7_a
All that yummy food you made
has given me lots of energy!
Yui
850038_6_a
Yes! Even better than I was
before lunch!
Yui
850038_5_a
Are you sure you're all right?
Asuna
850038_4_a
I feel so much better now after
that lap nap, Mommy!
Yui
850038_3_a
Asuna
850038_2_a
bg_event_grounds
I love you, Mommy!
Yui
850038_1_a
Mommy...
Yui
850037_29_a
...is my job as your mommy!
It comes with the territory, hehe.
Asuna
850037_28_a
Besides, taking care of my poor
little baby when she's feeling bad
at a school event...
Asuna
850037_27_a
I'll be fine. Come on now,
lie down.
Asuna
850037_26_a
Are you sure? Won't that be
uncomfortable for you?
Yui
850037_25_a
Come here, Yui. You can put your
head in my lap.
Asuna
850037_24_a
But I'm your mom. It's my
responsibility to look out for
you, and I didn't.
Asuna
850037_23_a
I was having so much fun, I just
wasn't thinking about how much
I was eating.
Yui
850037_22_a
That isn't your fault at all,
Mommy.
Yui
850037_21_a
So even though I thought you might
be eating too much, I didn't try
to stop you...
Asuna
850037_20_a
I was so happy you were eating
everything we made...
Asuna
850037_19_a
Why are you apologizing, Mommy?
Yui
850037_18_a
Then lie down! Ooh, my poor Yui...
I'm sorry...
Asuna
850037_17_a
Unngh... I'm just not used to
this sensation. It kind of hurts
to stand...
Yui
850037_16_a
The data will automatically defrag
after a time, so I'll be back
to normal soon.
Yui
850037_15_a
Y-Yes... I think it's only
temporary.
Yui
850037_14_a
A-Are you okay?!
Asuna
850037_13_a
Consuming too many calories seems
to have adversely affected my
avatar's ability to move...
Yui
850037_12_a
I think...
I think I ate too much...
Yui
850037_11_a
What's wrong, Yui?
Asuna
850037_10_a
Ugggh...
Yui
850037_9_a
...
Yui
850037_8_a
Hehe, we won't need luck to beat
you!
Asuna
850037_7_a
Thanks for the food, you two.
Good luck this afternoon!
Kirito
850037_6_a
Do your best, Daddy!
Yui
850037_5_a

Well, we're going to head back to
our team camps a little early.
Kirito
850037_1_a
Asuna
850035_33_a
You're right, I SHOULD taste test
everything. Well, here goes!
Yui

Silica

850035_30_a
Oh? Then it's only fair that you
eat some dessert to make sure it
turned out alright.
Sinon
850035_29_a
Asuna
850035_28_a
Aw, you're just saying that.
Yui
850035_27_a
Hehe, Yui knows because she helped
me make everything this morning.
Asuna
850035_26_a
Asuna
850035_25_a
Actually, we froze it ahead of
time so it'd be perfect for lunch!
Yui
850035_24_a
Liz
850035_23_a
It is pretty cold... Did you keep
it in the cooler or something?
Sinon
850035_22_a
This jelly is really amazing! It's
perfectly chilled, with just the
right amount of sweetness.
Silica
850035_21_a
Remember to save room for dessert
too, Yui!
Liz
850035_20_a
Sinon

Alright, alright, enough with the
sap!

Well, not always, but... I totally
get how you feel.
Yuuki

Asuna
850035_11_a
So this is making me unbelievably
happy!
Yui
850035_10_a
After researching how families
eat together like this in the real
world, I always wanted to try!
Yui
850035_9_a
Asuna
850035_8_a
Don't worry! I'll definitely be
able to eat everything when it's
this tasty!
Yui
850035_7_a
Leafa
850035_6_a
Come on, don't give her so much!
She won't be able to eat all that!
Agil
850035_5_a
And this!
Leafa

Agil

delicious! It's really, really
good, Mommy!
Yui
850033_33_a
We do!
Asuna
850033_32_a
Well then, if you insist!
Yui
850033_31_a
Hehe, I'm sorry. I guess I was
being a little too restrained...
Yui
850033_30_a
R-Really...?
Yui
850033_29_a
You're family, Yui. There's no
pecking order here!
Kirito
850033_28_a
Yeah! Not to offer you food I had
no hand in making, but still...
Kirito
850033_27_a
D-Don't be silly! There's no
need to wait, Yui!
Asuna
850033_26_a
Well, everyone else was so excited
I thought I'd wait until everyone
ate their fill.
Yui
850033_25_a
Yui, what's wrong? You haven't
eaten a thing.
Kirito
850033_24_a
What is it, Asuna?
Ah...
Kirito
850033_23_a
Huh?
Wait a sec...
Asuna
850033_22_a
Sure, my pleasure!
Yui
850033_21_a
Would you mind getting it for
them, Yui?
Asuna
850033_20_a
Yui
850033_19_a
Kirito
850033_18_a
Hehe, Klein, Yuuki, how about
some tea?
Asuna
850033_17_a
This is a case of do as I say,
not as I do, huh?
Agil
850033_16_a
Hehe, quit trying to talk with
your mouth full!

Simple but tasty stuff really is
the way to go! Like these saut
veggies--yummy!

The grilled fish is definitely my
favorite. It goes perfectly with
rice!

Alright everyone... Dig in!

This is a whole new experience

I'm crazy excited for lunch today!

Hehe, I can't wait!
Silica

Yui
850031_19_a
No worries! I made a ton. There's
plenty to go around.
Asuna
850031_18_a
Silica
850031_17_a
Sorry, Asuna, we just kind of left
lunch up to you...
Sinon
850031_16_a
You only care because it meant you
had to wait longer to get her
home-cooked meal!
Agil
850031_15_a
Agil

We thought you'd never get here!

Whoa, everyone's here?
Sorry to keep you all waiting!

Hey, there's Asuna!
Kirito

Why don't we find Kirito and the
others and eat together?
Asuna
850031_7_a
Yay, lunch time!
Yui
850031_6_a
We've prepared some special food
just for today, so be sure to stop
by the stalls or cafeteria!
Announcer

Eat some lunch and rest up. You'll
need your strength for the second
half this afternoon!

Alright, everyone. Time for a
one hour break.
Announcer
850031_1_a
Thank you. I really appreciate it.
Sinon
850028_20_a
Me too. Here, Sinon. You should go
give these herbs to the witch.
Silica
850028_19_a
Silica... Hehe, you might be
right... At least I hope so.
Sinon
850028_18_a
That's why I was able to gather
all the herbs and why my bad
luck stopped.
Silica
850028_17_a
I feel like she's starting to like
me after all this.
Silica
850028_16_a
But you know, I feel like...
Silica
850028_15_a
Uh, no, but... It just felt like
that's what she was saying,
is all.
Silica
850028_14_a
But she didn't even meow! Wait a
second, Silica, can you understand
her thoughts?!
Sinon
850028_13_a
Hehe, I think she's saying
"you're welcome."
Silica
850028_12_a
...
Black Cat
850028_11_a
I guess I ought to thank you
for showing her the way.
Sinon
850028_10_a
Really? That's good to hear...
Sinon
850028_9_a
No! And nothing bad happened
to me on the way back either!
I didn't even get lost!
Silica
850028_8_a
You're kidding!
Sinon
850028_7_a
It was that black cat! She showed
me where all the herbs were,
so I was able to pick them all!
Silica
850028_6_a
I'm glad you're safe...
How did you get back here, anyway?
Sinon
850028_5_a
Sorry, Sinon. It took me so long
to find the way back!
Silica
850028_4_a
Pina
850028_3_a
Silica

bg_02_forest
Silica, there you are!
I was so worried!
Sinon
850028_1_a
...
Silica
850027_28_a
You can always find beauty...
Even in the ugliest of times...
Right?
???
850027_27_a
I know that voice...!
Silica
850027_26_a
You get it now, don't you?
Being cursed with bad luck...
is all a state of mind...
???
850027_25_a
Huh?
Silica
850027_24_a
You sure are one
down-to-earth kid.
???
850027_23_a
...
Black Cat
850027_22_a
Thank you so much, kitty! You led
us here, didn't you?
Silica
850027_21_a
Chiiiirp chirp!
Pina
850027_20_a
I can't believe how many there
are!
Silica
850027_19_a
And I think... Yes! All the herbs
that the witch asked for are
right here!
Silica
850027_18_a
Meoooow...
Black Cat
850027_17_a
I know! Such beautiful flowers!
Silica
850027_16_a
Chirp chiiiiirp!
Pina
850027_15_a
bg_04_field_flower
Look at this place...!
Silica
850027_14_a
Hey, wait! Please don't go, kitty!
Silica
850027_13_a
...
Black Cat
850027_12_a
Huh? What is it, Pina?
Oh! The kitty!
Silica
850027_11_a
Chiiiirp!
Pina
850027_10_a
I am cursed,
just like Sinon said...
Silica
850027_9_a
And I can't use a map, so I can't
even go back to where we started
unless I get killed...
Silica
850027_8_a
Chiiiirp...
Pina
850027_7_a
No, Pina, we aren't able to fly
in this area.
Silica
850027_6_a
Chiiiirp!
Pina
850027_5_a
And I lost sight of the kitty
too... Now what do I do?
Silica
850027_4_a
I got separated from Sinon while
we were chasing after the kitty...

... Oh no...
Silica
850027_1_a
Yes, ma'am!
Silica
850025_27_a
Hey! Don't just abandon us in the
middle of the forest! You're our
guide! After her, Silica!
Sinon
850025_26_a
She ran away!
Silica
850025_25_a
Meeooow!
Black Cat
850025_24_a
...
Black Cat
850025_23_a
D-Don't cry... Hey, cat! Whatever
you're doing to Silica, cut it
out!
Sinon
850025_22_a
Maybe she's cursing me with
bad luck because I'm still a
stranger... 
sniffle
Silica
850025_21_a
Well, she's used to you because
she sees you every day, but
not me.
Silica
850025_20_a
What are you talking about?
Sinon
850025_19_a
Maybe... Maybe it's because she
doesn't like me?
Silica
850025_18_a
But it is strange that nothing bad
has happened to me...
Sinon
850025_17_a
That's the reason everyone
immediately thinks of witches
having black cats for familiars.
Sinon
850025_16_a
Think about it. Black cats are
said to be unlucky, after all.
Sinon
850025_15_a
...
Black Cat
850025_14_a
No way!
Silica
850025_13_a
Hold on, you don't think it's
that cat's fault, do you?
Sinon
850025_12_a
W-Well, yeah, I suppose...
Silica
850025_11_a
It's a lot of accidents in not a
lot of time.
Sinon
850025_10_a
Falling into that hole, getting
dive-bombed by birds, getting
sprayed by those stinkshrooms...
Sinon
850025_9_a
Huh?
Silica
850025_8_a
Is it just me, or does bad luck
seem to be following you around
like a shadow today?
Sinon
850025_7_a
All these bats just flew right
into my face...
Silica
850025_6_a
What happened, Silica?!
Sinon
850025_5_a
Owwww...
Silica
850025_4_a
Pina
850025_3_a
Sinon
850025_2_a
bg_08_forest
Aaahh!
Silica
850025_1_a
...
Black Cat
850023_20_a
Thank you...
Silica
850023_19_a
Are you okay? Here, I'll help you
out. Take my hand.
Sinon
850023_18_a
Eurgghh... Watch out for that
hole in the mud... Don't fall
in like I did.
Silica
850023_17_a
Silica!
Sinon
850023_16_a
Ha ha, she is going pretty fast...
Waaaaaah!
Silica
850023_15_a
Phew... I'm glad she's showing us
the way, but would it kill her to
go at a pace we can keep up with?
Sinon
850023_14_a
The kitty's going that way!
Let's follow her lead!
Silica
850023_13_a
Let's see... Now where do we go?
Sinon
850023_12_a
Yeah, which is exactly why
we needed a guide.
Sinon
850023_11_a
bg_08_forest
This forest really is dense! All
these trees make it feel like
a labyrinth!
Silica
850023_10_a
I'm not sure about that...
Sinon
850023_9_a
Hehe, still, she's pretty adorable
in her own way!
Silica
850023_8_a
That witch would have the world's
most haughty cat as her familiar.
Sinon
850023_7_a
That cat never meows. She always
acts so aloof, even when I feed
her, and never lets me pet her.
Sinon
850023_6_a
Huh? Not even the teeniest meow
in return...
Silica
850023_5_a
...
Black Cat
850023_4_a
Pina
850023_3_a
Sinon
850023_2_a
bg_02_forest
Aren't you just the sweetest
kitty? I know you'll be the best
guide ever!
Silica
850023_1_a
Alright, let's get going.
Sinon
850021_20_a
Heh, seems like Pina wants to
be friends too.
Silica
850021_19_a
Chiiiirp!
Pina
850021_18_a
Ooh, that sounds fun too! I can't
wait to make friends with a
cute little kitty!
Silica
850021_17_a
Exactly.
Sinon
850021_16_a
You mean we have to get her
familiar to guide us there?
Silica
850021_15_a
So we have to convince the witch's
black cat to come with us.
Sinon
850021_14_a
Um... It seems like it's pretty
easy to get lost in the forest
looking for these herbs.
Sinon
850021_13_a
Alright, then let's go!
Silica
850021_12_a
If we each take half, though,
it shouldn't be a problem.
Sinon
850021_11_a
She pointed out the ones she wants
in the forest, but there are way
too many for me to handle alone.
Sinon
850021_10_a
Great, thanks! I have to pick some
medicinal herbs for her.
Sinon
850021_9_a
Oh, that sounds fun!
I'd love to help.
Silica
850021_8_a
There's something I'd like your
help with, as part of my studies.
Sinon
850021_7_a
Yes.
Silica
850021_6_a
So you know how I'm studying magic
with that witch who lives near the
Dread Bastion?
Sinon
850021_5_a
Of course!
What do you need, Sinon?
Silica
850021_4_a
Pina
850021_3_a
Silica
850021_2_a
bg_02_forest
Hey, Silica, can I ask you
a favor?
Sinon
850021_1_a
Well, then we've learned
something!
Liz
850018_18_a
I didn't realize the success rate
for this technique would jump so
high if we were perfectly matched!
Silica
850018_17_a
You have! But when Asuna said
that my partner had to be in sync
with me,
Silica
850018_16_a
Heh, haven't I told you to talk to
me whenever you're having trouble?
Liz
850018_15_a
Thank you so much for coming to
find me, Liz! This was amazing!
Silica
850018_14_a
Hah... Hahaha! I guess so!
Silica
850018_13_a
Hehe. So that's how in sync
we are, huh?
Liz
850018_12_a
B-Because it is! I don't think any
of the other pairs mastered it
this quickly!
Silica
850018_11_a
Well, that was easy! Why'd you
make it sound so hard?
Liz
850018_10_a
I-I think so... At least, we got
the same effect as everyone
else who's done it!
Silica
850018_9_a
Whoa! Did... Did we do it?
Liz
850018_8_a
What the
Silica
850018_7_a
So I leave the enemy to you,
fall back...and attack again!
Silica
850018_6_a
YAAAAAAH!
Liz
850018_5_a
Right on!
Liz
850018_4_a
Okay, Liz! This is where you
switch!
Silica
850018_3_a
Liz
850018_2_a
bg_10_field
HAAAH!
Silica
850018_1_a
Yes, of course!
Silica
850017_26_a
Okay, so... How do we do this?
Can you explain it to me from
the very beginning?
Liz
850017_25_a
Y-You got it!
Silica
850017_24_a
Did I or did I not tell you to stop
worrying about that? Now c'mon,
let's go!
Liz
850017_23_a
I wasn't sure if you'd have
the time, that's all.
Silica
850017_22_a
Th-That's not at all what I meant!
I just know it takes a long time
to master this technique!
Silica
850017_21_a
Duh! Unless you don't think
I'm worthy?
Liz
850017_20_a
You...and me?
Silica
850017_19_a
Well then, let's give it a shot!
Liz
850017_18_a
O-Okay.
Silica
850017_17_a
So what's the problem? Can't find
a partner you can use Asuna's
technique with?
Liz
850017_16_a
Thank you so much!
Silica
850017_15_a
I'm never too busy for a friend!
Don't worry about that other
stuff.
Liz
850017_14_a
B-But you said you were busy!
Silica
850017_13_a
What were you giving me the cold
shoulder for? You could've just
asked me to try Asuna's technique!
Liz
850017_12_a
Liz!
Silica
850017_11_a
Turn that frown upside down!
Liz
850017_10_a
Chirp!
Pina
850017_9_a
Huh?
Silica
850017_8_a
Tsk tsk! Do I hear someone getting
down on themselves?
???
850017_7_a
I could ask the others, but I
don't think I can keep up with
any of them.
Silica
850017_6_a
I was just thinking about how
hard it is for me to learn that
technique.
Silica
850017_5_a
Sorry, Pina...
Silica
850017_4_a
Chirp...?
Pina
850017_3_a
Pina
850017_2_a
bg_10_field
sigh
Silica
850017_1_a
It's mainly the staying in sync
with your partner thing that's
giving you trouble.
Sinon
850015_22_a
Yeah, you're incredibly flexible
out on the battlefield.
Sinon
850015_21_a
I hope you know how important
that is.
Leafa
850015_20_a
You're great at distracting
enemies and drawing aggro.
Leafa
850015_19_a
I don't think that's it at all!
You're partnered up with Pina,
and you're quick on your feet.
Leafa
850015_18_a
Am I just that much weaker than
everybody else?
Silica
850015_17_a
Oops. Yeah, I forgot.
Sinon
850015_16_a
C-Careful, Sinon! She hates it
when people call her that!
Leafa
850015_15_a
I see. Yeah, your avatar's light.
It's no surprise the Berserk
Healer sent you flying.
Sinon
850015_14_a
Just trying to keep up with them
was enough to send me flying.
Silica
850015_13_a
Yeah, but that didn't work
either. Her sword strikes
were too powerful.
Silica
850015_12_a
Did you try it with her?
Sinon
850015_11_a
You had Asuna explain the
technique to you before you
came, didn't you?
Sinon
850015_10_a
It all comes down to the bond...
Sinon
850015_9_a
Well, I mean...
Leafa
850015_8_a
I just don't think I can do it...
Silica
850015_7_a
N-No, it wasn't.
Sorry I wasted your time...
Silica
850015_6_a
That wasn't good.
Sinon
850015_5_a
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Leafa
850015_4_a
AAH!
Silica
850015_3_a
G-Got it!
Silica
850015_2_a
bg_10_field
Match my movements, Silica!
Leafa
850015_1_a
O-Okay.
Silica
850013_24_a
Good idea. It's one of those
things you've got to try for
yourself.
Sinon
850013_23_a
Ah, gotcha. Well, you can practice
with us in the meantime.
Leafa
850013_22_a
No... She and the Leprechauns have
been pretty busy, so I haven't
asked...
Silica
850013_21_a
Have you thought about asking Liz?
Sinon
850013_20_a
No way! You're a perfectly fine
player, Silica.
Leafa
850013_19_a
And Sinon's arrows are so accurate
it's like she's playing on an
entirely different level...
Silica
850013_18_a
I-I mean, you move so fast...
Silica
850013_17_a
How would you know?
You haven't even asked yet!
Leafa
850013_16_a
I'm beginning to think there's no
way either of you would say yes...
Silica
850013_15_a
But now that you've shown me what
you can do...
Silica
850013_14_a
I, ah... I actually came here
hoping to ask one of you to
be my partner.
Silica
850013_13_a
Heh, you can say that again!
Leafa
850013_12_a
But the beauty of Asuna's new
technique lies in its versatility.
Sinon
850013_11_a
I can see why.
Sinon
850013_10_a
That was incredible... I didn't
think something like that was
possible with a sword and bow!
Silica
850013_9_a
Heh, what do you think?
Leafa
850013_8_a
Leafa
850013_7_a
Sinon
850013_6_a
Wh-Whoaaaa...
Silica
850013_5_a
Leafa
850013_4_a
Ready!
Sinon
850013_3_a
Sinon
850013_2_a
bg_10_field
Let's do this, Sinon!
Leafa
850013_1_a
I know she will! Thank you!
Silica
850011_21_a
Good idea, seeing as how you're
both Cait Sith. She'll be sure to
help you out.
Asuna
850011_20_a
Absolutely! I'll ask Sinon later.
Silica
850011_19_a
You should have them show you
sometime. It's worth it.
Asuna
850011_18_a
I've seen them pull it off.
It's quite something.
Asuna
850011_17_a
Apparently, yes. I was surprised
too.
Asuna
850011_16_a
This technique works with swords
and bows?!
Silica
850011_15_a
Leafa and Sinon?! Really?!
Silica
850011_14_a
Oh, and Leafa and Sinonon.
Asuna
850011_13_a
Well, there's Kirito and me...
Alice and Eugeo...
Asuna
850011_12_a
Who's learned to use it so far?
Silica
850011_11_a
That way they'll know all the
tricks to it, too.
Asuna
850011_10_a
And it goes without saying that
it helps if your partner already
knows how to use the technique.
Asuna
850011_9_a
So you have to get along well...
Hmm...
Silica
850011_8_a
You won't be able to pull it off
if there's any amount of bad
blood between you.
Asuna
850011_7_a
You have to be completely in sync,
right down to your breathing.
Asuna
850011_6_a
It is. And that's why you need to
choose a really good partner.
Asuna
850011_5_a
But it seems like the kind of
thing that takes a lot of practice
to fully grasp.
Silica
850011_4_a
I see. I think I understand the
theory behind your technique now.
Silica
850011_3_a
Silica
850011_2_a
bg_10_field
That's how I'd explain it
at least.
Asuna
850011_1_a
Right!
Yuuki
840358_20_a
Thanks, Yuuki! I can tell we're
in good hands!
Asuna
840358_19_a
Heh! I like how easily you're
taking all this in stride.
Kirito
840358_18_a
So rest easy, guys! Sleep-Fightin'
Yuuki has your backs!
Yuuki
840358_17_a
Hmmm, I guess so...
And if it's no use trying to stay
up too late. It's bad for you!
Yuuki
840358_16_a
You know, as long as you can get
the job done, no one said you need
to be awake to do it!
Asuna
840358_15_a
Asuna
840358_14_a
Kirito
840358_13_a
I dunno if that's a compliment,
but thanks anyway!
Yuuki
840358_12_a
Heh, she's got a sixth sense
for battle.
Sinon
840358_11_a
Ha ha! That's so Yuuki.
Your body goes into autopilot at
the first sign of battle!
Leafa
840358_9_a
Sinon
840358_10_a
Asuna
840358_8_a
Yuuki
840358_7_a
Awake, asleep, or somewhere in
between... You seemed to have
everything under control.
Kirito
840358_6_a
No how many monsters spawned,
you didn't wake up once!
You just took them out!
Asuna
840358_5_a
That was our reaction!
Kirito
840358_4_a
Asuna
840358_3_a
Kirito
840358_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
I did WHAT?!
How is that possible?!
Yuuki
840358_1_a
Zzz...
Yuuki
840357_38_a
Seriously?!
Asuna
840357_37_a
No... She's still sound asleep!
She took out that monster without
even opening her eyes!
Kirito
840357_36_a
Mmm, no more pie, please... Zzz...
Yuuki
840357_35_a
S-So Yuuki was awake this whole
time?!
Asuna
840357_34_a
Yeah...
She chopped it right in half!
Asuna
840357_33_a
Did...
Did she just attack that thing?!
Kirito
840357_32_a
Wh-What just happened?!
Asuna
840357_31_a
Gyaaagh!!
Monster
840357_30_a
Zzz zzz...
Yuuki
840357_29_a
Yuuki! Look out!!
Asuna
840357_28_a
And it's heading straight for
Yuuki!
Kirito
840357_27_a
Oh no! A sea monster!
Asuna
840357_26_a
What was that?!
Kirito
840357_25_a
GRRGGAAAHHH!
Monster
840357_24_a
...
Kirito
840357_23_a
Yeah... She'll be upset if we
don't let her at least try to
handle this.
Asuna
840357_22_a
Let's wait a little. Maybe she'll
come to on her own.
Asuna
840357_21_a
But the captain will flip if he
finds out! Should we wake her up?
Kirito
840357_20_a
So much for the night watch.
Sometimes there's just no
fighting biology.
Kirito
840357_19_a
Poor Yuuki... In the battle of
drowsiness versus enthusiasm,
sleep always wins out in the end.
Asuna
840357_18_a
It's hard to make out, but it
looks like she's going to sleep?
Kirito
840357_17_a
Kirito
840357_16_a
Huh? She's getting pretty
comfortable there...
Asuna
840357_15_a
Maybe I'll just rest my eyes...
Yuuki
840357_14_a
It's completely dead out here
tonight.
Yuuki
840357_13_a
yawn
So sleepy...
Yuuki
840357_12_a
アスナ
840357_11_a_1
Heh, apparently us.
Kirito
840357_11_a
Who watches the watchman, eh?
Or watchwoman.
Asuna
840357_10_a
So I figured I'd just observe
quietly from afar for now.
Kirito
840357_9_a
I was worried about her,
but I don't want to throw
her off her game.
Kirito
840357_8_a
But she seems to be taking
this job really seriously.
Kirito
840357_7_a
Well, I was going to just say
hello...
Kirito
840357_6_a
Yeah, I can see that. But why
all the sneaking and secrecy?
Asuna
840357_5_a
Sssh... Yuuki's coming by on the
night watch soon. I'm keeping
an eye on her.
Kirito
840357_4_a
Hey, Kirito?
Asuna
840357_3_a
Asuna
840357_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
...
Kirito
840357_1_a
This is the job I got picked for,
so I'm going to do my best!
Yuuki
840355_39_a
I shouldn't complain.
Yuuki
840355_38_a
It's fine!
After all, I wanted a pirate job.
Yuuki
840355_37_a
Yuuki, I don't think you should
push yourself.
Asuna
840355_36_a
Hmm... It's worth a try!
Yuuki
840355_35_a
Yuuki
840355_34_a
Asuna
840355_33_a
How about just becoming nocturnal?
Sleep all day, then work at night!
Kirito
840355_32_a
Though that's not practical if you
have to be walking around in the
dark.
Sinon
840355_31_a
Leafa
840355_30_a
I usually read something to keep
boredom and sleepiness at bay in
the crow's nest.
Sinon
840355_29_a
Asuna
840355_28_a
Kirito
840355_27_a
Unless you count saving the bosun
from falling overboard.
The guy sleepwalks! Hahaha!
Yuuki
840355_26_a
Asuna
840355_25_a
Kirito
840355_24_a
I guess so. It was all clear last
night.
Yuuki
840355_23_a
Leafa
840355_22_a
Of course, if something did
happen, the excitement would
wake you right up.
Sinon
840355_21_a
Asuna
840355_20_a
Kirito
840355_19_a
I hope so! I'll try anything!
Yuuki
840355_18_a
Leafa
840355_17_a
Sinon
840355_16_a
I think there's a "Banish Sleep"
potion that might help!
Leafa
840355_15_a
Asuna
840355_14_a
Kirito
840355_13_a
And it's a job where you
seriously can't doze off!
Yuuki
840355_12_a
Honestly, the worst part is
getting sleepy from the boredom.
Yuuki
840355_9_a
Asuna
840355_11_a
Kirito
840355_10_a
Leafa
840355_8_a
Night watch must be even
tougher than I thought.
Sinon
840355_7_a
Asuna
840355_6_a
Kirito
840355_5_a
You can
yawn
say that again.
Yuuki
840355_4_a
Kirito
840355_3_a
Yuuki
840355_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
Ouch, so that's what it's like...
Night watch sounds exhausting.
Asuna
840355_1_a
I'm gettin' sleepy...
Yuuki
840353_16_a
I just wish I had someone to talk
to while I skulk around... Like a
ghost pirate? That'd be cool!
Yuuki
840353_15_a
yawn
Yuuki
840353_14_a
...
Yuuki
840353_13_a
I'll give it my best shot!
Yuuki
840353_12_a
Don't I get a say? Oh, well.
Asuna and the others didn't like
their jobs at first either.
Yuuki
840353_11_a
...
Yuuki
840353_10_a
Quit your bellyaching and get to
work, Purple Boy!
Captain
840353_9_a
Yeaaah, but I bet there's another
job way more up my alley somewhere
on this ship...
Yuuki
840353_8_a
If you see anything off, report it
immediately. Got that, kid?
Captain
840353_7_a
You'll be our first line of
defense against any enemies
attacking under cover of darkness.
Captain
840353_6_a
It's pretty...normal? I wanted
something super piratey!
Yuuki
840353_5_a
Well, I guess my Imp skills give
me an edge in the dark, but...
Yuuki
840353_4_a
The night watch! I heard you see
well in the dark, Purple Boy.
Captain
840353_3_a
Captain
840353_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
So...this job is...?
Yuuki
840353_1_a
Congrats, Yuuki!
Asuna
840351_30_a
Kirito
840351_29_a
Asuna
840351_28_a
Yes!! Finally! I'm officially a
cool pirate with a cool pirate
job!
Yuuki
840351_27_a
I got a job for you!
I'll fill you in on the way.
Captain
840351_26_a
Kirito
840351_25_a
Asuna
840351_24_a
I'm a girl, if you hadn't noticed!
Yuuki
840351_23_a
Kirito
840351_22_a
Asuna
840351_21_a
Purple...boy?
Are you talking to me?!
Yuuki
840351_20_a
Hey! Purple Boy!
Captain
840351_19_a
Sinon
840351_18_a
I wonder what job would be the
most "Yuuki"?
Leafa
840351_17_a
Kirito
840351_16_a
Asuna
840351_15_a
I'm not a Cait Sith.
I wouldn't make much of a lookout.
Yuuki
840351_14_a
Leafa
840351_13_a
I'll trade with you, Yuuki.
Sinon
840351_12_a
I got to be helmsman, Asuna got to
cook, Sinon was on lookout, and
Sugu was the ship's swordmaster.
Kirito
840351_9_a
Yuuki
840351_11_a
Asuna
840351_10_a
Now that you mention it, you're
the only one who didn't get
assigned a special job yet.
Kirito
840351_8_a
I wanna get put in charge of
something fun, too!
Yuuki
840351_7_a
You guys get all these cool pirate
jobs! Meanwhile I'm still doing
chores.
Yuuki
840351_6_a
What do you mean, Yuuki?
Asuna
840351_5_a
Kirito
840351_4_a
Asuna
840351_3_a
Man, you guys are so lucky!
Yuuki
840351_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
(Kirito and his friends found many
adventures waiting for them on
the high seas...)
840351_1_a
Yeah, let's grab everything we
can!
Silica
840348_21_a
Whoops, we don't have time to
speculate!
Kirito
840348_20_a
The clock's ticking, so get to
rock-hunting!
Announcer
840348_19_a
But watch out, kids! The fish will
come back if you wait too long!
Announcer
840348_18_a
Or maybe they just wanted to make
sure the kids knew the fish were
gone.
Silica
840348_17_a
Ha, everyone must have had trouble
with those fish if they felt they had
to make an announcement.
Kirito
840348_16_a
Everyone, now's your chance to
gather that ore!
Announcer
840348_15_a
The spawn point for the minnow
DBAs has just been destroyed!
Announcer
840348_14_a
We have an announcement about
today's Shining Emerald event!
Announcer
840348_13_a
Yeah!
Silica
840348_12_a
Now we can finally focus on
finding Pina a mineral snack!
Kirito
840348_11_a
That was a great idea, Silica!
With the mama fish gone, the
little ones are disappearing!
Kirito
840348_10_a
I'm sure that'll stop all the
little ones from coming out!
Silica
840348_9_a
Well, there's a big mama fish in
there! Let's go beat her up!
Silica
840348_8_a
Nice find!
So what do we do...?
Kirito
840348_7_a
There's a hole they're all
spawning from!
Silica
840348_6_a
Yeah! I found out where all those
little fish are coming from!
Silica
840348_5_a
Did you find anything down there?
Kirito
840348_4_a
Pina
840348_3_a
Kirito
840348_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
gaaasp
Silica
840348_1_a
Silica...?!
Kirito
840347_17_a
I-I'm going under, Captain!
Wish me luck!
Silica
840347_16_a
You do?
What is it?
Kirito
840347_15_a
...I have an idea!
Silica
840347_14_a
Definitely. I want to feed Pina
some tasty ore soon too!
Silica
840347_13_a
I think Pina's telling us it's
hungry and wants a snack.
Kirito
840347_12_a
Chirp chiiirp...
Pina
840347_11_a
There's got to be a way to keep
these fish from bothering us...
Silica
840347_10_a
But with these fish here, it
really is hard to concentrate
on the search...
Kirito
840347_9_a
Then they'll be back to collecting
ore like us in no time.
Silica
840347_8_a
It looks that way. But I think
they'll get bored of their new
playmates soon.
Silica
840347_7_a
Ha ha, I think the kids found
something new to occupy
themselves with.
Kirito
840347_6_a
Let's catch this silly fish!
Children
840347_5_a
Pina
840347_4_a
Kirito
840347_3_a
Silica
840347_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
Ahahaha, it tiiickles!
Children
840347_1_a
Yeah!
Silica
840345_55_a
That's good to know?
Well, I can deal with it too.
Let's keep looking.
Kirito
840345_54_a
This is nothing! I can take a
tickle any day of the week!
Silica
840345_53_a
B-But what about you?
Are you going to be okay?
Kirito
840345_52_a
K-Kirito, it's okay. Let them go.
Some people just can't withstand
a tickle attack!
Silica
840345_51_a
Silica
840345_50_a
H-Hey, come on!
What about the ore?
Kirito
840345_49_a
M-Me too!
Liz
840345_48_a
Silica
840345_47_a
Liz
840345_46_a
That's it! I can't take it
anymore! I'm out!
Sinon
840345_45_a
W-We won't
hehehe!
Be able to gather any
ahahaha!
Asuna
840345_44_a
Hehehe, ahahaha!
Wh-What do we do?
Asuna
840345_43_a
Adorable enemies for a kids'
event? I like it.
Kirito
840345_42_a
Ahahaha! It tickles too much
to pick up any rocks!
Children
840345_41_a
Asuna
840345_40_a
Kirito
840345_39_a
Ahh! They're starting to swarm!
S-Stop it, fishies! We can't focus
on gathering ore with you here!
Leafa
840345_38_a
Sinon
840345_37_a
Silica
840345_36_a
Aha, y-yeah... When they all go
at once, it kinda t-tickles!
Liz
840345_35_a
Leafa
840345_34_a
Asuna
840345_33_a
Yeah. This is AR, so they can't
actually do that, but I guess
someone just really likes them.
Kirito
840345_32_a
Liz
840345_31_a
Sinon
840345_30_a
They're those little fish at spas
that eat dead skin, right?
Silica
840345_29_a
Yeah, they're doctor fish.
Or at least, something like them.
Asuna
840345_28_a
It doesn't seem like they're
dealing any damage... I think
I've heard of these before.
Kirito
840345_27_a
Asuna
840345_26_a
Kirito
840345_25_a
Gahahaha! It t-tickles!
Leafa
840345_24_a
Then again, I'd be really upset
if I was standing in a school of
actual minnows.
Sinon
840345_23_a
You're right. I think they're
OS monsters, though they
aren't particularly monstrous.
Sinon
840345_22_a
This pool's filled with thousands
of tiny fish!
Liz
840345_21_a
Sinon

WAH!
Everyone, look!

840345_18_a
Now that you mention it...
Asuna
840345_17_a
Is it just me, or does it feel
like something's touching your
feet too?
Kirito
840345_16_a
It's nothing, but...
Something's tickling my feet...
Kirito
840345_15_a
Hey Kirito, is something wrong?
Asuna

Leafa

Kirito

Chirp!
Pina

Sinon
840345_9_a
Pina
840345_8_a
Pina, don't pout. We'll find you
another one, so you'll just have
to be patient.
Silica
840345_7_a
Asuna
840345_6_a
Kirito
840345_5_a
Ahaha, Pina's upset that Silica
gave away that tasty-looking
afternoon ore snack!

Chirp chiiirp...
Pina
840345_1_a
Thanks, miss! You're the best!
Child
840343_23_a
Of course you can.
I'm sure I'll find another.
Silica
840343_22_a
Wow, really?! I can have it?!
Child
840343_21_a
Oh... Umm, in that case,
here. Take mine.
Silica
840343_20_a
I've been looking for one all
over, but I can't find any...
Child
840343_19_a
Huh?
Silica
840343_18_a
Wow! You've got a really pretty
rock there, miss!
Child
840343_17_a
Sinon
840343_16_a
Silica
840343_15_a
Chirp...
Pina
840343_14_a
I guess the ore you're after is
pretty rare.
Leafa
840343_13_a
Kirito
840343_12_a
Leafa
840343_11_a
Yeah... It's mostly just your
average, everyday pebbles...
Asuna
840343_10_a
Sinon
840343_9_a
Silica
840343_8_a
For a kids' event, there aren't
a lot of drops to pick up...
Liz
840343_7_a
Asuna
840343_6_a
Leafa
840343_5_a
Whoa, congrats, Silica!

Ah, I found one! Look at this!
It's a Shining Emerald!
Silica
840343_1_a
Leafa
840341_42_a
Kirito
840341_41_a
Sure! Let's do it!
Asuna
840341_40_a
Yup, so can we go?
Silica
840341_39_a
Sinon
840341_38_a
Silica
840341_37_a
Chiiirp!
Pina
840341_36_a
But, on the other hand, it'll
be a grand buffet for Pina.
Kirito
840341_35_a
I guess that's why they designed
the event, huh?
Leafa
840341_34_a
Asuna
840341_33_a
Leafa
840341_32_a
Makes sense. A lot of kids collect
cool rocks from rivers and so on.
Kirito
840341_31_a
but Pina loves chomping on the
ore you can get there!
Silica
840341_30_a
It was designed to be a mini-game
kids and their parents could play
together,
Silica
840341_29_a
Apparently, you can gather ore at
the bottom of this pool!
Silica
840341_28_a
Liz
840341_27_a
Sinon
840341_26_a
Exactly!
At least you get me, Kirito!
Silica
840341_25_a
Asuna
840341_24_a
Leafa
840341_23_a
Ha ha... You're interested in the
OS event, right?
Kirito
840341_22_a
It's not like I want to hang out
with kids, or that every other
pool's too big for me! It's not!
Silica
840341_21_a
Liz
840341_20_a
Sinon
840341_19_a
Y-You guys have the wrong idea!
Silica
840341_18_a
Asuna
840341_17_a
Kirito
840341_16_a
S-Silica, I know you're still
pretty small, but I think you're
selling yourself short here...
Leafa
840341_15_a
The kids' pool? The water there
barely comes up to my knees...
Liz
840341_14_a
I just read about an OS mini-
event at the kids' pool, so I
thought it'd be fun to check out.
Silica
840341_13_a
Sure, no prob. Where do you
want to go?
Sinon
840341_12_a
Umm... There's one pool I'd like
to go if that's okay...
Silica
840341_9_a
Sinon
840341_11_a
Liz
840341_10_a
There's still a lot of areas we
haven't checked out yet.
So, where to next?
Leafa
840341_8_a
It's really packed chock full of
fun. "Water park" is an apt name!
Asuna
840341_7_a
Kirito
840341_6_a
Leafa
840341_5_a
There really are. There's that
thermal pool, and the jungle
pool, and tons of water slides...
Asuna
840341_4_a
Sinon
840341_3_a
Silica
840341_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
There sure are a lot of different
pools in here.

840341_1_a
Heh heh!
Glad to hear it.
Kazuto
840338_16_a
munch, munch
Yum!
It's so nice and refreshing!
All is forgiven.
Suguha
840338_15_a
Heh heh! You got it!
Suguha
840338_14_a
They'll get mad if they
find out we left them out.
Kazuto
840338_13_a
Fine, fine! There you go. Just
don't tell the others we got
snow cones without them, okay?
Kazuto
840338_12_a
It looks yummy!
Gimme a taste!
Suguha
840338_11_a
Blue Hawaii.
Kazuto
840338_10_a
Mine's strawberry.
What'd you get?
Suguha
840338_9_a
Hey! Can't a guy eat a snow
cone? I wanted one, too.
Kazuto
840338_8_a
Oh, come on! You only wanted
one 'cause I did! Same as in
Ordinal Scale just now.
Suguha
840338_7_a
This one's mine.
And YOU can't have it.
Kazuto
840338_6_a
Wait a minute. You got me two?
Suguha
840338_5_a
sigh
Only when it's
convenient for you...
Kazuto
840338_4_a
Yaaay! Thank you, Kazuto!
I love you!
Suguha
840338_3_a
Suguha
840338_2_a
bg_event_festival
There you go! One snow cone.
Kazuto
840338_1_a
See that you do!
Suguha
840337_14_a
Okay, you win...
Wait here for a minute.
I'll go buy you one.
Kazuto
840337_13_a
But I want it nooow! And then
I can have another one once
we get to the fairground.
Suguha
840337_12_a
Just wait and we'll
get one later.
Kazuto
840337_11_a
A snow cone? Now? Can't we
just get one when we meet with
the others at the festival?
Kazuto
840337_10_a
Nothing beats a snow cone
to cool you down.
Suguha
840337_9_a
Hmmm! You must go and...buy me
a snow cone at the store!
Suguha
840337_8_a
sigh
Okay, okay... You win.
What's the punishment?
Kazuto
840337_7_a
I find you guilty
on both counts.
Suguha
840337_6_a
Hey! I only did the
first of those things!
Kazuto
840337_5_a
Slack off in battle, AND
embarrass me about my clothes?
Tsk, tsk!
Suguha
840337_4_a
What?!
What'd I do?
Kazuto
840337_3_a
Kazuto
840337_2_a
bg_event_festival
Kazuto!
You must face punishment!
Suguha
840337_1_a
N-Nope!
Kirito
840335_24_a
Did you...see anything?
Suguha
840335_23_a
...
Kirito
840335_22_a
Eep! My clothes
are coming
loose again!
Suguha
840335_21_a
...
Kirito
840335_20_a
Phwaaa...
So hot!
Suguha
840335_19_a
Flattery'll get you nowhere!
You're the reason I'm sweating
like a pig right now!
Suguha
840335_18_a
I guess all the kendo
practice paid off!
Kirito
840335_17_a
Anyway, you're the better
Ordinal Scale player, Sugu!
Kirito
840335_16_a
Okay, but, still!
Suguha
840335_15_a
with Ordinal Scale battles,
s-so I figured...
Kirito
840335_14_a
Y-Yeah, but...
I just told you how
I get really tired out
Kirito
840335_13_a
Why'd you make me do
everything?!
Suguha
840335_12_a
I mean, I know they weren't
that strong. I figured you
could take care of a few!
Suguha
840335_11_a
gulp!
Kirito
840335_10_a
That was a pretty lousy
job you just did.
Suguha
840335_9_a
Huh? Uh, sure. Go ahead.
Kirito
840335_8_a
Yeah... But if I may offer
a little feedback, Kazuto?
Suguha
840335_7_a
Yeah, but what can you do?
They popped out of nowhere.
Kirito
840335_6_a
I think so. I didn't expect to
get caught up in a battle like
that, just gathering items...
Suguha
840335_5_a
Phew! That was the
last of them, right?
Kirito
840335_4_a
GRAAAWRGH!

Suguha
840335_1_a
Ha ha!
Kirito
840333_17_a
Kirito
840333_16_a
Ha ha! I knew you'd crack
eventually, Kazuto!
Suguha
840333_15_a
Ordinal Scale, activate!
Kazuto
840333_14_a
Okay...
Oh, what the heck.
I'll go, too!
Kazuto
840333_13_a
I'm gonna check it out!
Suguha
840333_12_a
That's the idea.
Aha! Spotted something!
Suguha
840333_11_a
Oh, okay. I guess that makes
sense. You might get a good
item drop.
Kazuto
840333_10_a
It's a good idea to check out
what's available in areas you
don't get to often.
Suguha
840333_9_a
And I will! But you get
different rewards from
location data in this game.
Suguha
840333_8_a
Yikes! So much for chilling
out in the evening breeze.
Kazuto
840333_7_a
Ordinal Scale, activate!
Suguha
840333_6_a
Good idea.
We've got a while before we
meet up with Asuna and the--
Kazuto
840333_5_a
Yeah! Let's just enjoy the
evening air.
Suguha
840333_4_a
Yeah. There's no crowd here,
so you can really feel the
breeze.
Kazuto
840333_3_a
Kazuto
840333_2_a
bg_event_festival
Phew...
It's pretty refreshing now
that we've made it all the
way here.
Suguha
840333_1_a
Just mind the wardrobe
malfunctions! Yeesh...
Kazuto
840331_18_a
Kazuto! Don't you DARE look!
Suguha
840331_17_a
Huh?
Eeek!
Suguha
840331_16_a
How did you not notice?!
Kazuto
840331_15_a
Fix yourself up!
Y-Your yukata's coming loose!
Kazuto
840331_14_a
Huh?
What's the matter?
Suguha
840331_13_a
It'd suit you better than--
ACK! Sugu!
Kazuto
840331_12_a
I guess you can handle it,
since you're already used
to doing sports.
Kazuto
840331_11_a
Phew...
Either way, it sure is hot.
Suguha
840331_10_a
Heh. I guess so. But I don't
know if it's worth getting as
worn out as that by battles.
Kazuto
840331_9_a
Isn't that all part of the
fun, getting immersed in the
realism?
Suguha
840331_8_a
if you get carried away
like in ALO, it just leaves
you all sweaty and exhausted.
Kazuto
840331_7_a
But since you're actually
moving around in the real
world,
Kazuto
840331_6_a
Heh heh! That's one way of
looking at it.
Kazuto
840331_5_a
The only "cool" thing
around here is Ordinal Scale,
am I right?
Suguha
840331_4_a
Sure is...
We need to cool down.
Kazuto
840331_3_a
Kazuto
840331_2_a
bg_event_festival
Phwaaa...
So hot...!
Suguha
840331_1_a
...I promise I shall!
Orpheus
840328_42_a
No problem! Just make
sure you keep looking
forward, all right?
Philia
840328_41_a
Thank you, travelers! Without
you, this precious lyre would
have been lost, and I...
Orpheus
840328_40_a
If they both become stars,
they get to be together forever...sort of.
Philia
840328_39_a
Yeah. This version
is a lot less depressing
than the one I heard.
Philia
840328_38_a
Wow!
Silica
840328_37_a
Really?!
Oh, thank you, Lord Zeus!
Orpheus
840328_36_a
You may join your beloved
again in time, in the sky
as a shining star.
Zeus
840328_35_a
Enough. Your sorrowful lyre
tells me all I need to know.
Zeus
840328_34_a
I wasted the precious
opportunity you granted
me, and--
Orpheus
840328_33_a
Lord Zeus!
Please forgive me...
Orpheus
840328_32_a
Is that who I think it is?!
Silica
840328_31_a
Philia
840328_30_a
Silica
840328_29_a
Orpheus...
???
840328_28_a
Thank you...
Orpheus
840328_27_a
All I can do for her now
is turn the pain
in my heart to music for her.
Orpheus
840328_26_a
She said she wanted
to hear my lyre...
Orpheus
840328_25_a
Travelers...
Orpheus
840328_24_a
Let her hear your song.
That was her last wish
from you, wasn't it?
Philia
840328_23_a
Eurydice may be gone...but if
you look up into the sky, her
soul is always there shining!
Philia
840328_22_a
...
Orpheus
840328_21_a
How could you let it fall
into the hands of thieves?!
Philia
840328_20_a
Your lyre is the thing
Eurydice loved the most!
Philia
840328_19_a
Orpheus!
What are you thinking?!
Philia
840328_18_a
Gaaaaaaagh!
Thief
840328_17_a
HYAAAAAH!
Philia
840328_16_a
Philia?!
Silica
840328_15_a
Th-Those brutes...!
Philia
840328_14_a
If you want to kill me, do it!
I've got nothing left to
live for in this world!
Orpheus
840328_13_a
What do you want?
Are you criminals?
Orpheus
840328_12_a
Here come the thieves!
Philia
840328_11_a
Hey, pretty boy!
Nice harp ya got there.
That'd fetch a few drachmae!
???
840328_10_a
I think so...
Philia
840328_9_a
And this is the part where
Orpheus gets murdered
by thieves, huh?
Silica
840328_8_a
I guess not...
Philia
840328_7_a
I guess we didn't
make it in time.
Silica
840328_6_a
Orpheus...
Philia
840328_5_a
Oh, Eurydice!
I'm sorry!
It's all my fault...
Orpheus
840328_4_a
Philia
840328_3_a
Silica
840328_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
sob
At the last moment,
I couldn't help myself...
Orpheus
840328_1_a
It's trying to slow us down
so we can't warn them!
Philia
840327_24_a
Do you think it could be...?
Silica
840327_23_a
What?! Of all times for
a monster to show up!
Philia
840327_22_a
GRAAAAAAAAAH!
Monster
840327_21_a
Okay!
We've gotta do something!
Silica
840327_20_a
Silica!
Let's go warn them!
Philia
840327_19_a
Even so...
I can't just stand
here and do nothing!
Philia
840327_18_a
...
Philia
840327_17_a
What?! Aw, jeez...
Silica
840327_16_a
It wouldn't be much of a
Tanabata story if they lived
happily ever after, right?
Philia
840327_15_a
So Zeus turns his lyre
into the constellation Lyra.
Those are the Tanabata stars.
Philia
840327_14_a
But, according to the myth,
Orpheus ends up losing her and
gets killed right after...
Philia
840327_13_a
If he can do that, they'll
be able to live in peace
on the surface, right?
Philia
840327_12_a
All Orpheus has to do is obey
that one measly command and
they'll be in the clear!
Silica
840327_11_a
I can't bear to watch...
Philia
840327_10_a
What's going to
happen to them?
Silica
840327_9_a
Oh...
Not far to the surface now!
Silica
840327_8_a
I'll play to your
heart's content!
Orpheus
840327_7_a
Ha ha!
You always did love music...
Orpheus
840327_6_a
The first thing I want
to do on the surface
is hear your lyre again!
Eurydice
840327_5_a
Y-Yes, my darling!
Oh, Orpheus, thank you!
Eurydice
840327_4_a
Philia
840327_3_a
Silica
840327_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
Hang on, Eurydice!
We're almost there!
Orpheus
840327_1_a
Philia
840325_29_a
Silica
840325_28_a
Hmmm...
Hades
840325_27_a
Th-That's it!
I'll take all the love in my
heart...and put it into song!
Orpheus
840325_26_a
...!
Orpheus
840325_25_a
I've got it!
Orpheus, wait!
Play your lyre!
Philia
840325_24_a
Wait a sec. The god of the
underworld said that
"words" won't work on him...
Philia
840325_23_a
Yikes.
What do we do now?
Philia
840325_22_a
What?!
So he won't even let Eurydice
go back with Orpheus at all?!
Silica
840325_21_a
Please, Lord Hades! Wait!
Orpheus
840325_20_a
Enough of this!
Leave this realm!
Hades
840325_19_a
Oh, yeah! I've heard this one!
And then Orpheus's lyre
becomes a constellation...
Silica
840325_18_a
But then, at the last moment,
Orpheus can't help but turn
to look at her...
Philia
840325_17_a
but he's not allowed to
turn and face her until they
make it back to the surface.
Philia
840325_16_a
Orpheus gets his Eurydice back
and tries to take her home,
Philia
840325_15_a
Seriously?!
What happens?
Silica
840325_14_a
Well, I wouldn't exactly call
it a happy ending...
Philia
840325_13_a
What's wrong, Philia?
Does something bad
happen to Orpheus?
Silica
840325_12_a
Poor guy. 
sigh
Philia
840325_11_a
Huh?
Silica
840325_10_a
I know this myth! It's the
story of Lyra, the lyre of
Orpheus, isn't it?
Philia
840325_9_a
Aw... He came all this way
and he still doesn't get to
see Eurydice?
Silica
840325_8_a
Your words won't
work here, boy.
Hades
840325_7_a
But she's my one true love!
Please, you have to let me
take her...!
Orpheus
840325_6_a
Feh! That might work on Zeus,
but you're going to need more
than sentimentality down here.
Hades
840325_5_a
Y-Yes...
I beg you, Lord Hades!
Orpheus

Philia

Silica

So...you want me to bring this
Eurydice nymph back to life?
Hades
840325_1_a
Aha! I remember now!
I know this story!
Philia
840323_25_a
And here's where the story
gets going.
Silica
840323_24_a
Okay.
So he goes to the underworld
to get his lover back.
Silica
840323_23_a
Y-Yes, Lord Zeus!
Orpheus
840323_22_a
This is as far as
I can take you.
The rest is up to you...
Zeus
840323_21_a
Thank you very much,
Lord Zeus!
Orpheus
840323_20_a
I shall show you the way.
Zeus
840323_19_a
The underworld? But how...?
Orpheus
840323_18_a
I will allow you to travel
to the underworld to see
your love.
Zeus
840323_17_a
The beautiful song
of your lyre tears
at my mighty heart.
Zeus
840323_16_a
Lord Zeus...!
Orpheus
840323_15_a
I am Zeus, King of the Gods.
???
840323_14_a
So that guy's name is Orpheus,
huh? I think I've heard that
before, too.
Philia
840323_13_a
What was that?
Silica
840323_12_a
Huh?
Youth
840323_11_a
Orpheus...
???
840323_10_a
Yeah... I just can't
quite place it, though.
Philia
840323_9_a
Really?
Silica
840323_8_a
Something seems really
familiar about this story...
Philia
840323_7_a
Aw...
It looks like that
guy's lost his love.
Silica
840323_6_a
And here I can do
nothing but play my
sorrowful songs.
Youth
840323_5_a
My beloved nymph Eurydice,
struck dead by a serpent...
Youth
840323_4_a
Philia
840323_3_a
Silica
840323_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
Oh, Gods!
How could this happen?
Youth
840323_1_a
Okay.
Silica
840321_20_a
That sound does sound like a
lyre, doesn't it? Let's go
find where it's coming from.
Philia
840321_19_a
Oh, I get it now!
Heh heh. Sorry about that...
Philia
840321_18_a
Not "liar." "Lyre"!
You know, like the harp!
Silica
840321_17_a
Huh...?
Ha ha! No, that's
not what I mean!
Silica
840321_16_a
Hey! Who are you
calling a liar?!
Philia
840321_15_a
A lyre?
Silica
840321_14_a
Silica
840321_13_a
bg_16_forest_night
Huh? That sound...
Philia
840321_12_a
Okay! Let's do this!
Philia
840321_11_a
Of course!
Count me in!
Silica
840321_10_a
I think I'll give it a try.
Do you want to come, too?
Philia
840321_9_a
I know, right?
That's what has me curious!
Philia
840321_8_a
I don't remember ever hearing
a Greek myth that sounded
like Tanabata, though...
Silica
840321_7_a
Greece, huh? So that means
stories about Zeus and
Olympus and so forth, right?
Silica
840321_6_a
Hmmm.
The one for Greece
could be fun...
Philia
840321_5_a
Do you want to try
one out, Philia?
Silica
840321_4_a
explore the different
versions of the Tanabata tale
they have in other countries.
Philia
840321_3_a
Silica
840321_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Well, the main Tanabata
quest is finished,
but we can still
Philia
840321_1_a
Sounds like a plan!
Kirito
840318_22_a
Good idea!
I'm starving too!
Yuuki
840318_21_a
I'm getting tired, though.
I could go for a snack and
some rest.
Asuna
840318_20_a
Ha ha! You're pretty
into this, Yuuki.
Kirito
840318_19_a
Nooo! I haven't had enough
fun and/or sun yet!
Yuuki
840318_18_a
Ha ha... Anyway, how about we head
back to check on our guests?
Kirito
840318_17_a
I'm just glad it didn't
happen in SAO.
Asuna
840318_16_a
W-Well... There I was minding my
own business, asleep, then wham!
Monsters everywhere!
Kirito
840318_15_a
Honestly, Kirito!
What is up with your timing!
Yuuki
840318_14_a
Y-You're taking that out of
context...
Asuna
840318_13_a
Pout all you want, but
you were pretty happy
to get a text from him!
Yuuki
840318_12_a
Kirito...
Asuna
840318_11_a
I'm just glad she
listened to reason...
Kirito
840318_10_a
Ah, I see!
Yuuki
840318_9_a
But since she kinda forced me to
participate, and 'cause I've got a
boyfriend, I think she understood.
Asuna
840318_8_a
Well... She said I'd probably
win, so she was shocked that
I dropped out.
Asuna
840318_7_a
What'd the lady say?
Yuuki
840318_6_a
It's okay. I smoothed
things over in the end.
Asuna
840318_5_a
I feel bad for messing up
the event though...
Kirito
840318_4_a
Asuna
840318_3_a
Kirito
840318_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Heehee! That was fun!
Yuuki
840318_1_a
Will do! Wait...
What?!
Asuna
840317_34_a
And tell that dreamboat
of yours I said hi!
Woman
840317_33_a
S-Sure thing!
Asuna
840317_32_a
Off you go! But come back if
you have enough time.
Woman
840317_31_a
...!
Asuna
840317_30_a
sigh
Oh, alright...
I see how it is.
Woman
840317_29_a
Aw, c'mon! Please!
Asuna
840317_28_a
H-Huh? But Asuna! You're a shoo-in
for the championship!
Woman
840317_27_a
Don't worry, he's right over there!
Yuuki
840317_26_a
Can I go save him?!
Asuna
840317_25_a
S-Sorry, emergency!
One of our party members
is getting ganked as we speak!
Asuna
840317_24_a
Hey, ladies! Where's the fire?
You're up in a minute, Asuna!
Woman
840317_23_a
I'm serious, Yuuki!
This is no time for jokes!
Asuna
840317_22_a
Hahaha!
Good one, Asuna!
Yuuki
840317_21_a
M-Maybe the tide came in and
a wave swept him outside of
the safe zone...
Asuna
840317_20_a
There's no way he could
get attacked there!
Yuuki
840317_19_a
What! How?! Wasn't he supposed
to be taking a nap in the safe
zone?
Yuuki
840317_18_a
Surrounded by monsters, for
the love of God, please help!
Asuna
840317_17_a
What'd he say?
Yuuki
840317_16_a
...!
Asuna
840317_15_a
Hmmm? Oh!
It's a message from Kirito...
Asuna
840317_14_a
Oh, right... Guys don't usually
like having strangers check out
their girlfriend, huh?
Yuuki
840317_13_a
And I just keep thinking
about Kirito...
Asuna
840317_12_a
It's just I didn't realize this
would be such a huge deal
with so many people...
Asuna
840317_11_a
N-No, that's not it...
Asuna
840317_10_a
Asuna... I'm sorry. You didn't
wanna get dragged into this,
did you?
Yuuki
840317_9_a
I-I don't think so...
Besides, I'm not even sure I...
Asuna
840317_8_a
Knock 'em dead, Asuna!
I just know you'll win!
Yuuki
840317_7_a
Looks like I went and
got picked... 
sigh
...
Asuna
840317_6_a
Aww, jeez... Looks like
I went and flunked it.
Yuuki
840317_5_a
Next, we're bringing the girls
up on stage one by one!
Announcer
840317_4_a
Yuuki

bg_event_seashore
Aaand the results are in! We're
down to the Top Five, folks!
Announcer
840317_1_a
Th-There are so many people
here, I'm kinda nervous...
Asuna
840315_34_a
Whoa....
Asuna's a real hit.
Yuuki
840315_33_a
wild cheering
Crowd
840315_32_a
Yuuki
840315_31_a
...
Asuna
840315_30_a
That's your cue, girls!
Strut your stuff!
Announcer
840315_29_a
Your votes decide the five
bodacious Betties moving
to the next round!
Announcer
840315_28_a
One of these thirty lovely ladies
will be crowned summer royalty!
Announcer
840315_27_a
Babes and dudes! Welcome to 1st
Annual Queen of the Beach contest!
Announcer
840315_26_a
Here's the waiting area.
Woman
840315_25_a
Then it's settled. You two follow
me. It's right this way...
Woman
840315_24_a
Yay!
Yuuki
840315_23_a
Well, it could be fun to have
you doing this with me, Yuuki.
Asuna
840315_22_a
Mmmm...
Asuna
840315_21_a
But, Asuna, are you sure you're up
to it? If you feel uncomfortable,
I'll give up on participating too...
Yuuki
840315_20_a
Mm... Can't say I like being treated
like this, but...as long as I get to
join, I'm game!
Yuuki
840315_19_a
Hehe, it just shows how much I
want you to participate. And, hey,
we've got some generous prizes.
Woman
840315_18_a
Erm... That sounds kinda
like discrimination...
Asuna
840315_17_a
But only as long as this lovely
Undine is coming along with you...
Woman
840315_16_a
Uh, you...? Well, hm... Uh...
Okay, sure...
Woman
840315_15_a
Whoa, cool! Count me in too!
I'm not only into duels and
violence, y'know.
Yuuki
840315_14_a
Yes way! The guests get to
vote on the winner.
Woman
840315_13_a
Queen of the Beach...
M-Me?! N-No way...
Asuna
840315_12_a
You should totally join!
Woman
840315_11_a
It's the Queen of the Beach
contest being held over there.
Woman
840315_10_a
Oh, how rude of me! I'm one of
the players holding an event on
this beach.
???
840315_9_a
Huh? What's this lady
rambling on about?
Yuuki
840315_8_a
Uh...thanks?
Asuna
840315_7_a
The avatar is nice too, but that
swimsuit! Just WOW!
???
840315_6_a
You're PERFECT!
???
840315_5_a
Er, yes?
Asuna
840315_4_a
Yuuki
840315_3_a
Asuna
840315_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Excuse me, miss...!
???
840315_1_a
Yay!
Yuuki
840313_19_a
Let's make it just the two of us,
then!
Asuna
840313_18_a
Oh, yeah... I guess Kirito does
like his power naps...
Asuna
840313_17_a
Nooo, no Kiritos! He said he
wanted to take a nap, right?
Yuuki
840313_16_a
Heh, that's for sure.
I'll go invite Kirito...
Asuna
840313_15_a
Even in the real world, it's not
every day you get to go to the
beach, right?
Yuuki
840313_14_a
No reason we can't have some
fun in the sun, though!
Yuuki
840313_13_a
Yeah.
Asuna
840313_12_a
They oughtta rest up until
Amayori's feeling better.
Yuuki
840313_11_a
Yeah, I get that.
Yuuki
840313_10_a
So it's confusing for them to
interact with other players.
Asuna
840313_9_a
Like I told you before, those two
are visitors from another world...
Asuna
840313_8_a
Relax! They're just taking it
easy in the guest house.
Yuuki
840313_7_a
Yikes... I wonder how Alice and
Eugeo are gonna cope with this
crowd.
Asuna
840313_6_a
There's lots of food and trinkets
for sale down there.
Yuuki
840313_5_a
Looks like this beach is a
regular ol' tourist trap!
Yuuki
840313_4_a
Wow! Talk about crowded!
Asuna
840313_3_a
Asuna
840313_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Just look at that, Asuna!
Yuuki
840313_1_a
Ha ha...
Kirito
840311_17_a
Hey! I just call 'em
like I see 'em.
Yuuki
840311_16_a
Y-Yuuki! Why don't you keep
your comments to yourself!
Asuna
840311_15_a
Oh myyyy! If it isn't the
lovebirds! Can't keep your
hands off each other, eh?
Yuuki
840311_14_a
Well, I appreciate it, Asuna...
Kirito
840311_13_a
Hehe. I wouldn't have said
it if I didn't mean it.
Asuna
840311_12_a
Heh. Makes me wonder when I get
a compliment like that...
Kirito
840311_11_a
I dunno. Guys' swimsuits just
kinda leave you walking around
half-naked...
Kirito
840311_10_a
Hehe. Thanks, Kirito!
You look nice in yours too!
Asuna
840311_9_a
You look really great
in that swimsuit.
Kirito
840311_8_a
By the way, Asuna, I meant
to tell you this before, but...
Kirito
840311_7_a
Hehe, I'll say! I was so relieved
when we finally cleared it.
Asuna
840311_6_a
It's just what we needed after
that last quest...
Kirito
840311_5_a
Yeah. I feel so relaxed here.
Kirito
840311_4_a
There's nothing like some downtime
by the seaside to unwind.
Asuna
840311_3_a
Kirito
840311_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Ah, now THIS is the life!
Asuna
840311_1_a
Chirp!
Pina
840308_82_a
Of course!
Silica
840308_81_a
Hopefully this'll put an end to
the rumors and Pina will be
safe outside again!
Suguha
840308_80_a
Chiiiirp!
Pina
840308_79_a
Pina was amazing too!
Liz
840308_78_a
Don't worry about it. I respect
you for standing up for your
friend like that.
Liz
840308_77_a
I'm sorry for all this,
you guys...
Silica
840308_76_a
Yeah. I was on pins and needles
the whole time, though!
Suguha
840308_75_a
Silica
840308_74_a
Suguha
840308_73_a
Phew... I'm glad that ended well.
Liz
840308_72_a
Th-Thank you so much!
Silica
840308_71_a
We'll tell the other players too.
Player C
840308_70_a
Mm-hmm. It is your friend,
after all!
Player B
840308_69_a
Alright... I believe you.
We'll stop going after it.
Player A
840308_68_a
I had those settings turned off
for today's battle.
Silica
840308_67_a
I didn't. Pina chose to come
out and save me...
Silica
840308_66_a
Chirp!
Pina
840308_65_a
So why'd you let your best friend
out and into harm's way?
Player C
840308_64_a
But you must have known people
have been trying to attack it
lately.
Player C
840308_63_a
Well, it DID save us...
Player B
840308_62_a
What do you guys think...?
Player A
840308_61_a
That thing is your friend...?
Player C
840308_60_a
So please...
Stop hunting my friend!
Silica
840308_59_a
Pina is one of my best friends!
Silica
840308_58_a
You don't owe us anything for
this...but I do want you to
understand Pina's kindness!
Silica
840308_57_a
Pina
840308_56_a
See? Pina is always looking for
ways to help out.
Silica
840308_55_a
Liz
840308_54_a
Nope. That was all Pina.
Suguha
840308_53_a
Suguha
840308_52_a
It wasn't us. We couldn't have
run there fast enough.
Liz
840308_51_a
Pina
840308_50_a
Silica
840308_49_a
That's what it looked like to me...
Player C
840308_48_a
Th-That monster...saved us, right?
Player B
840308_47_a
Pina
840308_46_a
Silica
840308_45_a
Phew...
Player A

P-Pina?!

CHIRRRRRRRP!!!
Pina

Suguha
840308_39_a
Aah! We can't get there in time!!
Liz
840308_38_a
Dammit! It's gonna totally
wipe us out!
Player C
840308_37_a
Liz
840308_36_a
Geez! That's a crazy powerful DBA!
Suguha
840308_35_a
Pina
840308_34_a
Silica
840308_33_a
Gah! Where'd that come from?!
That monster's supposed to be
really strong!
Player B
840308_32_a
Whoa!
Player A
840308_31_a
Oh no!
Silica
840308_30_a
Pina
840308_29_a
Silica

Graaaahh!!
Monster
840308_27_a

It doesn't seem like they're
going to be easily convinced...
Suguha

Suguha
840308_24_a
Ugh...! Those morons!
Liz
840308_23_a
Pina
840308_22_a
Silica
840308_21_a
I don't believe you. You just
made that up so you can score
all the points for yourself.
Player C
840308_20_a
Wait, you can DO that?
Player C
840308_19_a
I converted Pina's data from
a VRMMO so we could play
together in OS!
Silica
840308_18_a
Wh-What...?
Player B
840308_17_a
This isn't a DBA! This is Pina,
my tamed monster and close friend!
Silica
840308_16_a
Huh? Why aren't you attacking it?
Player A
840308_15_a
Stop!
Silica
840308_14_a
Let's attack it together!
Player C
840308_13_a
Everyone, come back here!
Player B
840308_12_a
Hey! There it is!
Player A
840308_11_a
Chirp!
Pina
840308_10_a
Pina
840308_9_a
Guys! Wait! Please, listen to
what I have to say!
Silica
840308_8_a
Suguha
840308_7_a
Uh-oh...!
Liz
840308_6_a
S-Silica?! What are you doing?!
Suguha
840308_5_a
I want the other players to
know the truth!

Suguha

bg_os_town_1
I don't want to play OS if
everyone's gonna keep
misunderstanding Pina...
Silica
840308_1_a
...
Silica
840307_24_a
What are we gonna do? They don't
look like they'll be giving up any
time soon...
Liz
840307_23_a
Aww, they left...
Suguha
840307_22_a
H-Hey!
Suguha
840307_21_a
We'll find it, no matter what!
Player C
840307_20_a
Nope! Let's go try somewhere else!
Player B
840307_19_a
Hey! You find anything over there?
Player A
840307_18_a
That's also when I first
met Kirito...
Silica
840307_17_a
Yes, it was when Pina died
protecting me.
Silica
840307_16_a
Is that...?
Suguha
840307_15_a
But Pina saved me without orders
once before too, back in SAO...
Silica
840307_14_a
Y-Yes...
Silica
840307_13_a
You changed the settings so that
wouldn't happen, right?
Liz
840307_12_a
I wonder how Pina was able to
come out in the first place...
Liz
840307_11_a
...
Silica
840307_10_a
I bet it's still close by!
Let's look around!
Player C
840307_9_a
You know, the little blue one
that's worth lots of points!
It's all over the internet!
Player B
840307_8_a
Yeah, I saw it too!
Player B
840307_7_a
Gah... I knew this would happen...
Suguha
840307_6_a
Oh no!
Silica
840307_5_a
Liz
840307_4_a
Suguha
840307_3_a
Silica
840307_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Hey! Have you seen a small
dragon around here?
Player A
840307_1_a
Chirp...
Pina
840305_28_a
Oh, right. Sorry, Pina...
Silica
840305_27_a
Hey, Silica. You should really
put Pina away before somebody
comes along.
Suguha
840305_26_a
Chirrrrp!
Pina
840305_25_a
Yes, because Pina saved me!
Silica
840305_24_a
Pina
840305_23_a
Silica
840305_22_a
Silica! Are you okay?!
Liz
840305_21_a
That little dragon...
Could it be...?
???
840305_20_a
Pina
840305_19_a
R-Right!
Silica
840305_18_a
Suguha
840305_17_a
Hey, save the talking until after
we've beaten the monster!
Liz
840305_16_a
Liz
840305_15_a
Maybe Pina chose to save
you on her own.
Suguha
840305_14_a
Silica
840305_13_a
CHIIIRP!!
Pina
840305_12_a
Pina...? B-But why...?
I didn't summon you...
Silica
840305_11_a
Grargh?!
Monster
840305_10_a
Silica
840305_9_a
CHIIIRP!!
Pina
840305_8_a
Liz
840305_7_a
Ugh... I won't make it in time...!
Silicaaaaaa!!
Suguha
840305_6_a
Huh?! Aaaaah!
Silica
840305_5_a
Suguha
840305_4_a
Silica! Look out!
Liz
840305_3_a
Silica
840305_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Graawr!
Monster
840305_1_a
Okay...
Silica
840303_20_a
Maybe you shouldn't use Pina
in battle for a while.
Suguha
840303_19_a
Anyway, be careful, Silica.
Suguha
840303_18_a
...
Silica
840303_17_a
It doesn't seem like anyone meant
any harm. This stuff just sorta
happens.
Suguha
840303_16_a
Noooo...
Silica
840303_15_a
that no one knows
what's true anymore.
Liz
840303_14_a
When there's SO much game content,
the things you hear from others
get so embellished over time
Liz
840303_13_a
Gah... How typical. This tends
to happen a lot in MMOs.
Liz
840303_12_a
Whaaaaat?!
Silica
840303_11_a
So now people think Pina can
be hunted and is worth a lot of
points too.
Suguha
840303_10_a
Remember how that boss we fought
before looked kind of like Pina?
Suguha
840303_9_a
Like what?
Silica
840303_8_a
Well, now there's a weird
rumor going around about it.
Suguha
840303_7_a
You told her you brought Pina
over here by conversion, right?
Liz
840303_6_a
Oh. Uh, yeah, sure...
Silica
840303_5_a
You know that player who asked
you about Pina?
Suguha
840303_4_a
Liz
840303_3_a
Silica
840303_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Hey, Silica...
Suguha
840303_1_a
No problem!
Silica
840301_24_a
Very cool. Thanks for the info!
Girl
840301_23_a
At least, that's how it was for
the person who helped me
convert this little cutie...
Silica
840301_22_a
It's actually not as easy as
it sounds. You need a lot of
programming knowledge to do it.
Silica
840301_21_a
Huh... I didn't know you could
do that.
Girl
840301_20_a
You can't, really. I converted my
monster's data from another VRMMO
so we could play together here.
Silica
840301_19_a
I never knew you could tame
monsters in Ordinal Scale.
Girl
840301_18_a
Yes, I was. Why do you ask?
Silica
840301_17_a
Were you just fighting together
with that monster?
Girl
840301_16_a
Yes...?
Silica
840301_15_a
Excuse me...
???
840301_14_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
840301_13_a
Hehe, I think so too!
Silica
840301_12_a
You guys fight perfectly together,
even here in OS!
Suguha
840301_11_a
Thank you!
Silica
840301_10_a
Suguha
840301_9_a
Silica
840301_8_a
Nice work, Silica. Your teamwork
with Pina is always really
impressive.
Liz
840301_7_a
Pina
840301_6_a
It's over!
Silica
840301_5_a
Gwaaaaah!
Monster
840301_4_a
Chiiiirp!
Pina
840301_3_a
Pina
840301_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Pina! Let's go!
Silica
840301_1_a
P-P-Please, please, please!
Don't tell ANYONE!!
Silica
840298_23_a
A popular girl like you could
make bank on that info.
Argo
840298_22_a
Nyahaha!
Yer loss, kiddo.
Argo
840298_21_a
I d-d-don't want ANY royalties!
J-J-Just promise you won't tell!
Silica
840298_20_a
I'd give ya a cut of the
royalties.
Argo
840298_19_a
If ya want me to, I'll put it on
the market!
Argo
840298_18_a
B-B-But you're not selling
THAT information, r-r-right?!
Silica
840298_17_a
Y-You what...?!
Silica
840298_16_a
I figured out who
ya like ages ago, too.
Argo
840298_15_a
Nehehe, lucky guess!
Figurin' stuff out is my
line of work, y'know.
Argo
840298_14_a
And I certainly didn't tell you!
Silica
840298_13_a
Argo! You sound like you already
know all about this!
Silica
840298_12_a
Yeah...
Hey, wait a minute!
Silica
840298_11_a
Yeah, guess so. So you're headin'
back to the straight 'n' narrow,
huh?
Argo
840298_10_a
There's no way they'd make spells
to mess with someone's heart.
Silica
840298_9_a
I guess it's obvious
when you think about it.
Silica
840298_8_a
but I guess it don't work
on players, huh?
Argo
840298_7_a
I figured it'd give ya a chance
after that wedding battle,
Argo
840298_6_a
Nehehe, my bad. I'll try to make
sure the info's more reliable
next time.
Argo
840298_5_a
Grrrr, thanks a lot, Argo! I had
to lie to Alicia because of you.
Silica
840298_4_a
News to me, kiddo.
Argo
840298_3_a
Silica
840298_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Nyahah! So that's what tha
spell was fer.
Argo
840298_1_a
Silica...?
Alicia
840297_24_a
Pina
840297_23_a
Aaah! Just forget I said anything!
Silica
840297_22_a
Ummm... See, the thing is...
Silica
840297_21_a
Wait... But I thought you said
Argo told you how to find it?
Alicia
840297_20_a
N-No reason! I just...uh, found
this neat spell! S-So I thought,
might as well learn it! Hehe...
Silica
840297_19_a
Ehehe!
Y-Yeah, but...
Silica
840297_18_a
Chirp!
Pina
840297_17_a
I figured Pina was the only
dragon you had.
Alicia
840297_16_a
W-Well, uh...
Silica
840297_15_a
What'd you want this spell
for anyhow, Silica?
Alicia
840297_14_a
First time I've ever seen
a player use it, though...
Alicia
840297_13_a
Huh?
Silica
840297_12_a
Seems this spell was prepared
for cases just like this.
Alicia
840297_11_a
That includes raising and
breeding them too.
Alicia
840297_10_a
Out of all the fairy races, we are
the experts of beast-taming.
Alicia
840297_9_a
Heh! That's Cait Sith
magic for you!
Alicia
840297_8_a
Hehe! Thank Argo! She's the one
who told me how to find it.
Silica
840297_7_a
The spell worked!
Silica, thank you so much!
Alicia
840297_6_a
Whoa! They're actually
playing nice!
Alicia
840297_5_a
Chirp ch-chirp...
Dragon
840297_4_a
Silica
840297_3_a
Alicia
840297_2_a
bg_18_sky_morning_sunset
Chirp chirp chiiirp!
Dragon
840297_1_a
For real?!
Alicia
840295_29_a
I think I know a way to make
those two dragons get along,
after all!
Silica
840295_28_a
Hm?
What is it?
Alicia
840295_27_a
Ah!
Silica
840295_26_a
...
Silica
840295_25_a
Maybe I should tell 'em
to pick another pair.
Alicia
840295_24_a
Mm-hmm. But I don't see
that happening soon...
Alicia
840295_23_a
Oh, I see... So, they're trying to
breed a little baby dragon, huh?
Silica
840295_22_a
and these are the two dragons
they picked.
Alicia
840295_21_a
That's the thing. The players
who are gonna ride 'em wanna
be a pair,
Alicia
840295_20_a
I see... But does it really matter
if they're friends or not?
Silica
840295_19_a
There's a pair of boy and girl
dragons that seriously don't
get along.
Alicia
840295_18_a
I was taming a few dragons for
the new dragoon recruits.
Alicia
840295_17_a
What about you, though?
You look pretty run down...
Silica
840295_16_a
Neat.
Alicia
840295_15_a
I just got back from
a quick dungeon run.
Silica
840295_14_a
Hey, Silica.
What's going on?
Alicia
840295_13_a
Pina
840295_12_a
Alicia
840295_11_a
Oh! Hi, Alicia!
Silica
840295_10_a
Phew! What a day...
???
840295_9_a
...
Silica
840295_8_a
And is it really okay to try and
mess around with someone's
heart like this...?
Silica
840295_7_a
But I wonder if it's actually
going to work...
Silica
840295_6_a
And Kirito will f-fall in
love with-
gulp
Silica
840295_5_a
That was easier than I thought!
Now I just gotta use this spell...
Silica
840295_4_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
840295_3_a
Pina
840295_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
I-I got it...!
Silica
840295_1_a
Yeah, that's the spirit!
Silica
840293_22_a
Chirp!
Pina
840293_21_a
Where I should find a treasure
chest containing a tome with
that magic spell.
Silica
840293_20_a
There's supposed to be a secret
chamber in a dungeon deep in the
mountains...
Silica
840293_19_a
Th-That's right, Pina! The first
step is do the quest and see if
the spell even exists.
Silica
840293_18_a
Ch-Chirp!
Pina
840293_17_a
Not with the safety features
it's got built into it...
Silica
840293_16_a
But there's no way the AmuSphere
would allow someone to really
do that...
Silica
840293_15_a
Oh no... I got a bit caught up
in daydreaming.
Silica
840293_14_a
Eep...!
Silica
840293_13_a
Silica
840293_12_a
bg_18_mountain
Chirrp?
Pina
840293_11_a
Aaah! This is the happiest
day of my life!
Silica
840293_9_a
And live together in
happiness forever!
Kirito
840293_8_a
Let us marry at once,
my love!
Kirito
840293_7_a
Oh, Kirito!
Silica
840293_6_a
...is you!
Kirito
840293_5_a
Silica
840293_4_a
bg_white
Oh, Silica...
The only girl I love...
Kirito
840293_3_a
And I use it on Kirito, then
maybe...
Silica
840293_2_a
bg_18_mountain
S-So if that spell is for real...
Silica
840293_1_a
Nehehe!
Pretty interesting stuff, eh?
Argo
840291_22_a
Seriously?!
It can even do that?
Silica
840291_21_a
Ya better believe it. Word on
the street is ya can use it ta
make someone fall in love.
Argo
840291_20_a
So it's a spell?
Silica
840291_19_a
Apparently there's a secret skill
only Cait Sith can use: some kinda
illusion magic.
Argo
840291_18_a
Now, just between you and me...
Argo
840291_17_a
O-Of course...
Silica
840291_16_a
Course, if you're satisfied with
my services, I expect ya ta
ya ta become a repeat customer.
Argo
840291_15_a
Nehehe! No sweat, this one's on
the house! Still a rumor at this
stage, anyhow.
Argo
840291_14_a
Hm? What kind of info? A-And how
much do you want for it?
Silica
840291_13_a
Nehehe! I might have just
the info ya need there.
Argo
840291_12_a
I guess so...
But I don't want to
let myself fall behind!
Silica
840291_11_a
I figure it'd give her an edge
in an action-heavy game
like ALO.
Argo
840291_10_a
Well, Asu's got loads of
experience. She's an SAO
Assault Team vet, y'know.
Argo
840291_9_a
she always trains super-hard...
Silica
840291_8_a
It's because she puts the effort
in. Even though Asuna was
the last of us to join ALO,
Silica
840291_7_a
Kii-boy ain't got nothin' on
ol' Asu, that's fer sure.
Argo
840291_6_a
Oh, you heard about that?
Hehe... It was pretty rough.
Silica
840291_5_a
I heard Asu kicked yer butt
somethin' awful in that
wedding event.
Argo
840291_4_a
Oh, hi Argo...
What do you mean?
Silica
840291_3_a
Silica
840291_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Tough break, eh, Silica?
Argo
840291_1_a
Heh, good one. And yes.
Philia
840288_19_a
Well, a rare item in the hand's
worth a mountain of buried
treasure, right?
Leafa
840288_18_a
Yeah, but I will return!
That buried treasure's MINE!
Philia
840288_17_a
So, should we head back?
It's getting pretty late.
Kirito
840288_16_a
Ahaha... I guess you're right.
Thanks, guys. You're the best.
Philia
840288_15_a
Yeah, cheer up!
Philia, your energy back there
brought us some awesome luck!
Leafa
840288_14_a
And we beat all those other
players to it, too!
Kirito
840288_13_a
Oh, stop moping. Your treasure
hunting skills helped us find some
sweet loot.
Kirito
840288_12_a
This is so lame...
Like, SO so lame...
Joy is fleeting
sadness, eternal.
Philia
840288_11_a
AR or not, I'll take it.
Besides, now we know why all those
players are here in the mountains.
Leafa
840288_10_a
So a real world legend became an
unreal world's reality? Cool.
Kirito
840288_9_a
It looks like OS made a quest
based off of that buried treasure
legend Philia told us about.
Kirito
840288_8_a
Well, this solves the mystery of
those players back there.
Kirito
840288_7_a
B-But... My treasure...
Philia
840288_6_a
Heh, looks that way. Those
sparkles were an OS effect.
You jumped the gun, Philia.
Kirito
840288_5_a
So my buried treasure wasn't real.
It was just an AR illusion...?
Philia
840288_4_a
Yeah, you're right!
Rares, as far as the eye can see!
Leafa
840288_3_a
What IS this...?!
Wait... OS items?
Philia
840288_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
This isn't the daimyo's treasure!!
Philia
840288_1_a
Leafa
840287_28_a
Ummm... I hate to burst your
river bubble, but...
Kirito
840287_27_a
What are you waiting for?!
Come on! Let's go dig it up!!
Philia
840287_26_a
Leafa
840287_25_a
Uh...really?
Kirito
840287_24_a
Wait wait wait! That's it!
It's the daimyo's buried treasure!
Philia
840287_23_a
Dude. Sparkles. Whoa.
Kirito
840287_22_a
Whoa! Sparkles everywhere!
Leafa
840287_21_a
The riverbed is all sparkly!
Philia
840287_20_a
I see...the river?
Something in the water, Philia?
Kirito
840287_19_a
Hold the phone!
Look, over there!
Philia
840287_18_a
If we're doing the latter, we can
check the web or ask those players
back there for info.
Kirito
840287_17_a
We can keep looking for this
buried treasure or see if an OS
quest triggered around here.
Kirito
840287_16_a
What are our options?
Leafa
840287_15_a
Let's figure out our next step
quick before more of them spawn.
Kirito
840287_14_a
That looked like the last of them.
This area's clear.
Leafa
840287_13_a
Kirito
840287_12_a
Super dead!
Thanks for the backup, guys!
Philia
840287_11_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Is it dead?
Kirito
840287_9_a
Leafa
840287_10_a
bg_black
Grraaaghk!!
Monster
840287_8_a
Take THIS!!
Philia
840287_7_a
Yeah, I got it! I'm grabbing
the last attack bonus!!
Philia
840287_6_a
Kirito
840287_5_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Philia!
I've knocked it thataway!
Leafa
840287_4_a
bg_black
Nnngak!
Monster
840287_3_a
Leafa
840287_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Hrrraaagh!
Kirito
840287_1_a
Bring it on, mountain monsters!
Leafa
840285_20_a
Yeah! They're in our way!
Philia
840285_19_a
We've got no choice but to take
them out! Let's go!
Kirito
840285_18_a
Ah! That pack spotted us!
Leafa
840285_17_a
Grrrawr!
Monster
840285_16_a
But we came up here to find buried
treasure, not go monster hunting.
Philia
840285_15_a
Heh, exactly...
Philia
840285_14_a
Which means...this is our chance
to snag the loot for ourselves!
Leafa
840285_13_a
Likely everyone assumed that
there'd be nothing to find this
deep in the mountains.
Kirito
840285_12_a
In that case, we're in luck
almost no one's come up this
way yet.
Kirito
840285_11_a
That's a good point.
Maybe all those OS players were
after whatever it's guarding?
Leafa
840285_10_a
Well, if there's a monster,
there's gotta be something here!
Philia
840285_9_a
No way! What's a monster doing
this deep in the mountains?
Kirito
840285_8_a
Grrr...
Monster
840285_7_a
Hey!
Look over there, you two!
Leafa
840285_6_a
What was that all about, anyway?
Kirito
840285_5_a
Yeah. Looks like we shook most
of that crowd too. There's almost

We've come pretty far upriver...
Philia
840285_1_a
Kirito
840283_31_a
Ahaha! Philia, looks like all this
talk of treasure has set your
hunter's spirit aflame!
Leafa
840283_30_a
Oh, quit complaining and get
treasure hunting!
Philia
840283_29_a
Leafa
840283_28_a
Yes, ma'am...
But I'm not a Spriggan
here in the real wor
Kirito
840283_27_a
The lower the odds, the more fun
the hunt! You're a Spriggan too,
so you better remember that!
Philia
840283_26_a
Kirito! Shame on you!
A true treasure hunter
lives for this sort of thing!
Philia
840283_25_a
Sure, I guess...
But I wouldn't bet on
us finding anything.
Kirito
840283_24_a
And we can check our AR map as we
explore. Super efficient!
Philia
840283_23_a
Exactly! With OS up and running,
we'll be back in our gaming boots!
Philia
840283_22_a
What, now?!
You want to go find that legendary
daimyo treasure or something?
Leafa
840283_21_a
We're out here anyway, so let's go
look for some buried treasure!
Philia
840283_20_a
Yeah? What is it, Philia?
Kirito
840283_19_a
Leafa
840283_18_a
I dunno...
Hey, I've got an idea!
Philia
840283_17_a
Yeah. Did a new quest just start?
Kirito
840283_16_a
Philia
840283_15_a
Kirito
840283_14_a
Whoa!
Look at all these new objects!
Leafa
840283_13_a
Kotone
840283_12_a
Suguha
840283_11_a
Let's do it...
Augma Start!
Kazuto
840283_10_a
Want to flip our Augmas on again?
Kotone
840283_9_a
Maybe they all found out that this
area was a game zone?
Suguha
840283_8_a
They're all turning their Augmas
on too.
Kazuto
840283_7_a
Yeah, now that you mention it...
Suguha
840283_6_a
Doesn't it seem like a whole lot
of people just showed up?
Kotone
840283_5_a
Yeah? What's up?
Kazuto
840283_4_a
Kazuto
840283_3_a
Suguha
840283_2_a
bg_event_riverside
Hey, guys?
Kotone
840283_1_a
Well, excuse me for being
combat-crazy.
Kazuto
840281_28_a
Unlike a certain combat-crazy
Spriggan I know!
Suguha
840281_27_a
Wow, that's so cool!
You were, like, born
to be a Spriggan!
Suguha
840281_26_a
I didn't know that.
You're really serious
about it, huh?
Kazuto
840281_25_a
Oh, but I make sure to get
permission first. No breaking
and entering!
Kotone
840281_24_a
VR or RL, I LOVE old stuff!
I'm always digging around for
artifacts and buried treasures!
Kotone
840281_23_a
Bingo!
Kotone
840281_22_a
Oh! I know! Over here! Pick me!
...TREASURE HUNTER!
Suguha
840281_21_a
Did you forget what they call
me in the virtual world?
Kotone
840281_20_a
Heh heh heh!
My dear Kazuto, you insult me!
Kotone
840281_19_a
Are you pretty well-informed when
it comes to local myths and so on?
Kazuto
840281_18_a
But I never heard any legends like
that associated with this area
before.
Kazuto
840281_17_a
I guess this is a prime place
to hide treasure...
Kazuto
840281_16_a
Suguha
840281_15_a
Oh. Cool.
Kazuto
840281_14_a
buried his family's treasure in
a valley somewhere in these
mountains.
Kotone
840281_13_a
Well, rumor has it that back in
the Edo period the daimyo who
ruled this area
Kotone
840281_12_a
Suguha
840281_11_a
Legend? What legend?
Kazuto
840281_10_a
Have you guys heard the
legend about this place?
Kotone
840281_9_a
By the way...
Kotone
840281_8_a
Ha ha. Thanks for the New Age
health advice.
Kazuto
840281_7_a
Totally. It's the negative ions
they're everywhere!
Suguha
840281_6_a
It just makes you feel relaxed,
you know?
Kotone
840281_5_a
You said it! Sitting here
listening to the river burble
and gazing at all this green...
Kotone
840281_4_a
Suguha
840281_3_a
Kotone
840281_2_a
bg_event_riverside
Ahh...
The joy of nature!
Kazuto
840281_1_a
Yes! Thank you so much, guys!
Silica
840278_18_a
That'd be pretty nice,
wouldn't it?
Kirito
840278_17_a
It might even be a way to get them
to understand how much I enjoy VR.
Silica
840278_16_a
Yeah... And that would keep their
feelings from getting hurt...
Silica
840278_15_a
I bet your parents would like it
too!
Leafa
840278_14_a
It'd be super cute!
Leafa
840278_13_a
I like the way you think, Asuna!
That way you'd have photos of
Keiko AND Silica in a kimono!
Leafa
840278_12_a
That way they can hang both up!
Asuna
840278_11_a
Me too. But since we're all here,
shouldn't we at least take a photo
in ALO as well?
Asuna
840278_10_a
Okay then. If that's what you
think you need to do, I'm all
for it.
Kirito
840278_9_a
Does it seem like a pain? Yes.
But I really think they go to such
great lengths out of love.
Silica
840278_8_a
But Silica...
Leafa
840278_7_a
the less I think they'll be okay
with me just taking a picture
in VR instead.
Silica
840278_6_a
The more I think about how excited
they get for this photo each year,
Silica
840278_5_a
In fact, they probably have a
million ideas of their own
already.
Silica
840278_4_a
Leafa
840278_3_a
Kirito
840278_2_a
bg_21_alne_sunset
I'm sure they'll be just as
excited as you all to choose a
backdrop and pick out clothes.
Silica
840278_1_a
You okay, Silica?
Kirito
840277_26_a
I've decided I'm going to take the
picture with my parents this year.
In real life.
Silica
840277_25_a
Like finding this quest and going
with me on it, but...I'm sorry.
Silica
840277_24_a
Hey, guys... I'm really glad you
went through all this trouble
for me.
Silica
840277_23_a
...
Silica
840277_22_a
Now that you mention it...
Kirito
840277_21_a
Ha ha, come on, Kirito! None of
that is necessary in VR!
Asuna
840277_20_a
Like keeping skin from looking
washed out
or removing wrinkles.
Kirito
840277_19_a
Like what?
Leafa
840277_18_a
Yeah, you're right. I've heard
that high photography stats give
you some corrective abilities.
Kirito
840277_17_a
Obviously it should be someone
with pretty high photography
stats.
Asuna
840277_16_a
We need a realistic backdrop! And
who's going to take the picture?
Leafa
840277_15_a
O-Okay.
Silica
840277_14_a
Right, let's get that photo taken!
Kirito
840277_13_a
Absolutely. Great job, everyone.
Asuna
840277_12_a
bg_21_alne_sunset
Nice move, Silica! That ought to
get you the Girls' Day outfit.
Leafa
840277_9_a
Silica
840277_11_a
Kirito
840277_10_a
GRAAAAAAGHHHHH!
Monster
840277_8_a
YAAAAAAAAH!!
Silica
840277_7_a
CHIRRRRRP!
Pina
840277_6_a
Okay! Let's go, Pina!
Silica
840277_5_a
Take the last shot, Silica!
Asuna
840277_4_a
Silica
840277_3_a
Asuna
840277_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_sao
Okay, the boss is almost dead!
Kirito
840277_1_a
Oh, Silica...
Asuna
840275_28_a
I guess it's their way of showing
affection, since they have trouble
telling me how they feel.
Silica
840275_27_a
Maybe that's why they get so
excited about all these family
events.
Silica
840275_26_a
But they would never tell me that.
Silica
840275_25_a
I think they might feel that way,
yes.
Silica
840275_24_a
Oh...
Silica
840275_23_a
That's just how my mother is,
so I was curious.
Asuna
840275_22_a
Sorry, I don't mean to pry.
Asuna
840275_21_a
Well, um...
Silica
840275_20_a
Do your parents not like you
playing around in VR?
Asuna
840275_19_a
...
Asuna
840275_18_a
I really wish they could see how
much fun VR can be...
Silica
840275_17_a
I'm really worried about what
they'll say...
Silica
840275_16_a
Kirito
840275_15_a
I don't know what they'll say, but
it's worth a shot!
Silica
840275_14_a
I'm not the one who'll be looking
at it, though. Silica's parents
will!
Leafa
840275_13_a
Well, if you don't look at them
Kirito
840275_12_a
Ehhh, they might notice the
cat ears...
Leafa
840275_11_a
I think you're right!
Silica
840275_10_a
Yeah, and then you can just print
it out in the real world, frame
it, and no one will be the wiser.
Kirito
840275_9_a
so it looks almost exactly like
the real you!
Asuna
840275_8_a
Not to mention you imported your
avatar from SAO,
Asuna
840275_7_a
Putting on a kimono and taking a
photo in-game will be a cinch!
Leafa
840275_6_a
Good thinking, Kirito!
Leafa
840275_5_a
Oooh, you're right!
Silica
840275_4_a
Leafa
840275_3_a
Silica
840275_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
This quest. The reward is a
twelve-layer kimono for Girls'
Day.
Kirito
840275_1_a
How about what?
Silica
840273_22_a
How about this, Silica?
Kirito
840273_21_a
Did you say something, Kirito?
Silica
840273_20_a
VR, eh...?
Kirito
840273_19_a
You don't even have to spend time
setting it up or finding a place
to put it.
Asuna
840273_18_a
That's true. And people take them
down the second Girls' Day is
over.
Asuna
840273_17_a
She's got a point there. Now it's
just cool to put one in your
private room in VR.
Leafa
840273_16_a
Most families don't even put out
a doll display, like you were
saying.
Silica
840273_15_a
But I don't know anyone else my
age who has to do that kind
of thing!
Silica
840273_14_a
so I can see why they'd want to
dote on you now.
Kirito
840273_13_a
Well, you were trapped in SAO
for two whole years,
Kirito
840273_12_a
They never listen, though. They're
already really excited about this
year's photo.
Silica
840273_11_a
I know! Too seriously! I told them
I don't want to do it anymore.
It makes me so uncomfortable!
Silica
840273_10_a
Wow, they take it really
seriously.
Leafa
840273_9_a
And then we go to a professional
photographer, and it gets put in
a big frame and hung up somewhere.
Silica
840273_8_a
Yes, exactly.
A really fancy rental, too.
Silica
840273_7_a
A family photo, huh? So they make
you dress up in a kimono and
everything?
Kirito
840273_6_a
My parents always want to take a
family photo whenever Girls' Day
comes around.
Silica
840273_5_a
Why is that?
Asuna
840273_4_a
Kirito
840273_3_a
Leafa
840273_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
I always dread Girls' Day a
little bit.
Silica
840273_1_a
Everything okay, Silica?
Kirito
840271_25_a
...
Silica
840271_24_a
Hm? Oh, at my house? Umm...
Silica
840271_23_a
How does your family celebrate,
Silica?
Kirito
840271_22_a
Lately I've noticed that fewer and
fewer families put up doll
displays, though.
Kirito
840271_21_a
Asuna
840271_20_a
Well, every family celebrates
Girls' Day differently, right?
Kirito
840271_19_a
...
Kirito
840271_18_a
That's not why we started talking
about all this, anyway! Sheesh!
Asuna
840271_17_a
Wha
! Don't you start, Leafa!
Asuna
840271_16_a
Ah. Well, either way, I think we
already know who you're REALLY
gonna marry!
Leafa
840271_15_a
Ahem...
Kirito
840271_14_a
I don't know about that... My dad
also wanted me to marry Sugo,
remember.
Asuna
840271_13_a
Ha ha, they're really looking out
for you, huh?
Leafa
840271_12_a
And then I just sit back and watch
them argue about it.
Asuna
840271_11_a
My mom always says she hopes I
marry young, and then my brother
and dad always reject that idea.
Asuna
840271_10_a
Yeah, why would it be a big deal?
Leafa
840271_9_a
What does that mean?
Kirito
840271_8_a
We've got one set up at my house!
It always turns into this big deal
with my family, though.
Asuna
840271_7_a
Uh, why wouldn't we? And you're
helping, by the way!
Leafa
840271_6_a
Are we going to set up the doll
display in the house this year
too?
Kirito
840271_5_a
Oh, yeah!
Silica
840271_4_a
Kirito
840271_3_a
Silica
840271_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Girls' Day is coming up, isn't it?
Leafa
840271_1_a
S-Seven!!
Asuna
840268_21_a
Hehe, that sounds fun too, though!
Seven
840268_20_a
Anyway, we should head back to the
estate. If we take much longer, the
head maid will yell at us again.
Asuna
840268_19_a
Hahaha, I know that!
Asuna
840268_18_a
Hehe! Of course! I'm not just
some kid who can't help but
break plates!
Seven
840268_17_a
Ha ha! You're always thinking of
complicated things like that,
Seven.
Asuna
840268_16_a
Asuna
840268_15_a
Ah, bozhe moi...!
Seven
840268_14_a
Though, now that I think about it,
that's kind of inflexible too...
Ack, did I just make a paradox?
Seven
840268_13_a
It's just... As a woman of science,
I really can't stand inflexibility.
Seven
840268_12_a
To be honest, I don't care
either way.
Seven
840268_11_a
There she goes...
Asuna
840268_10_a
...
Asuna
840268_9_a
Hmph... I'll think about that...
Player C
840268_8_a
Asuna
840268_7_a
...
Player C
840268_6_a
But quit looking down on
everyone who has a
different taste.
Seven
840268_5_a
I've got no problem with you
admiring the elegance of
actual maids in history.
Seven
840268_4_a
Asuna
840268_3_a
Seven
840268_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
I... I lost...
Player C
840268_1_a
Asuna
840267_20_a
About time!
Seven
840267_19_a
That does it! I challenge you 
to a duel!
Player C
840267_18_a
Grrr...! You're pretty cheeky
for a little brat!
Player C
840267_17_a
Seven...
Asuna
840267_16_a
You can like whatever you want,
but don't act like everything
else is inferior.
Seven
840267_15_a
Whether you think it's high
culture or pop culture, it's
still just your personal opinion.
Seven
840267_14_a
There's nothing wrong with the
cute image of maids that's popular
in Japan these days.
Seven
840267_13_a
Just because you're trying to
be historically accurate doesn't
mean you're right.
Seven
840267_12_a
Seven...
Asuna
840267_11_a
What was that?
Player C
840267_9_a
Asuna
840267_10_a
That's exactly the kind of
self-righteous nonsense I hate
most of all.
Seven
840267_8_a
Wow, that's ...
Seven
840267_7_a
My guild is taking this chance
to spread the word about
historically-accurate maids!
Player C
840267_6_a
You could say that ALO is helping
to create a much more accurate
image of maids.
Player C
840267_5_a
Uhm... So it sounds like this girl
has the exact opposite view
as those girls we met earlier.
Asuna
840267_4_a
Asuna
840267_3_a
Seven
840267_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
A well-made, historically-accurate
maid uniform is far superior
to a chintzy Japanese knock-off!
Player C
840267_1_a
...
Seven
840265_17_a
And I assure you that those
so-called "maids" have no basis
in the historical record!
???
840265_16_a
I'm part of a guild dedicated to
the research of Victorian era
fashion.
???
840265_15_a
Seven
840265_14_a
Huh...?
Um, can I help you?
Asuna
840265_13_a
But those otaku maids
are totally fake!
???
840265_12_a
Yeah! These days, otaku things
like maids are popular around
the world.
Seven
840265_11_a
Oh right! Come to think of it,
Americans even hold conventions for
anime and Japanese games, right?
Asuna
840265_10_a
You'd be surprised! Otaku culture
is becoming a global phenomenon
these days.
Seven
840265_9_a
Right... So I guess you never see
otaku stuff like that back in
the States, huh, Seven?
Asuna
840265_8_a
That's still a part of Japanese
pop culture.
Seven
840265_7_a
Even if the image of maids that you
usually see in Japanese games is
exaggerated to appeal to otakus...
Seven
840265_6_a
No, not at all. Besides, I look
cute as a maid.
Seven
840265_5_a
Hey, Seven... Do you feel the
same way as those girls? About
being a maid?
Asuna
840265_4_a
...
Seven
840265_3_a
Seven
840265_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
I wonder if those girls will drop
out of the event in the end...
Asuna
840265_1_a
O-Of course we know what they do!
It's just, well... We don't
really like it....
Player A
840263_22_a
You guys don't have a clue
what actual maids do, huh?
Seven
840263_21_a
Wh-What's with this girl?
Player B
840263_20_a
This is what the maids at an English
great house actually did. We get
to enjoy the historical accuracy!
Seven
840263_19_a
I get that this maid event is
different from the otaku-friendly
maids you see in Akihabara, but...
Seven
840263_18_a
Wh-Who are you?
Player A
840263_17_a
Ah... Seven...
Asuna
840263_16_a
Look at you guys! Throwing in
the towel already?!
Seven
840263_15_a
I think you read my mind.
Player B
840263_14_a
All I wanted was to wear a cute
maid dress! Maybe I should just
quit... What do you think?
Player A
840263_13_a
Yeah...
Seven
840263_12_a
Looks like those players are
doing the maid event too.
Asuna
840263_11_a
It's really hard work, and the
NPCs keep yelling at me...
???
840263_10_a
I know what you mean! I thought
it'd be like working at a cute
maid cafe, but...
???
840263_9_a
Seven
840263_8_a
It's pretty different
from what I expected.
???
840263_7_a
Asuna
840263_6_a
I was looking forward
to the maid event, but...
???
840263_5_a
Time to head back to the estate.
Asuna
840263_4_a
Yep!
Seven
840263_3_a
Seven
840263_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
That takes care
of today's shopping.
Asuna
840263_1_a
Hehe! Yeah, I know.
Seven
840261_25_a
But no matter how fun it might be,
you shouldn't make her angry on
purpose.
Asuna
840261_24_a
Ha ha... Now I see what you mean.
For a second there I thought you'd
gone nuts.
Asuna
840261_23_a
So it's actually kinda fun to get
yelled at in a virtual world!
Seven
840261_22_a
I was just thinking...
I don't ever get scolded by
adults in my real job.
Seven
840261_21_a
Wh-What is?
Asuna
840261_20_a
It's just really funny!
Seven
840261_19_a
Huh...? Seven?!
Asuna
840261_18_a
Hee hee... Ahahaha!
Seven
840261_17_a
Yeah...
Seven
840261_16_a
Seven
840261_15_a
She was pretty mad, huh...
Asuna
840261_14_a
Y-Yes, ma'am...
Seven
840261_13_a
How many times must I tell you...?
Be careful!
Head Maid
840261_12_a
I-I'm really sorry...
Seven
840261_11_a
Miss Seven! Did you just smash
all of those precious dishes!
Head Maid
840261_10_a
Oh dear...
Asuna
840261_9_a
Wh-Whoops...
Seven
840261_8_a
Aaahh!
Seven
840261_7_a
Careful...
Asuna
840261_6_a
That's right. The one with
all the very expensive,
very fragile wineglasses.
Asuna
840261_5_a
Okey-dokey!
Seven
840261_4_a
Oh, that one? It goes in
the shelf over there.
Asuna
840261_3_a
Asuna
840261_2_a
bg_12_church_lounge
Asunaaa! What do I do
with this plate?
Seven
840261_1_a
Heh, thanks. I'd like to think
you're right.
Leafa
840258_27_a
Hehe, I think you're right.
And your feelings were what gave
that love the push it needed!
Yuuki
840258_26_a
That wasn't a scripted event...
It was a change brought about by
the power of love.
Leafa
840258_25_a
Hehe, yeah. Actually...
No, I don't think they did.
Leafa
840258_24_a
Ahaha, totally! But I never
thought they'd have added in
multiple endings!
Yuuki
840258_23_a
Yeah. I'm just glad we got to
change the ending.
Leafa
840258_22_a
Looks like we got the Little
Mermaid's episode!
Yuuki
840258_21_a
I hope you two live happily
ever after.
Leafa
840258_20_a
She keeps bowing to you, Leafa.
I think she's very grateful for
what you did.
Yuuki
840258_19_a
...
Little Mermaid
840258_18_a
I'm so happy for you!
Leafa
840258_17_a
Yeah... Now THIS is the ending
I wanted to see!
Leafa
840258_16_a
She looks so happy...
Yuuki
840258_15_a
...!!
Little Mermaid
840258_14_a
Ha ha, you accompany me now not as
my attendant...but as my wife.
That is, if you will have me.
Prince
840258_13_a
...!
Little Mermaid
840258_12_a
Now come! The castle awaits!
Prince
840258_11_a
A-Ah, sure. No problem.
Leafa
840258_10_a
I apologize for the
misunderstanding, fair maiden.
Can you ever forgive me?
Prince
840258_9_a
Ha ha ha! I am truly a fool!
I could not remember your face
until you saved me again.
Prince
840258_8_a
Don't tell me...
Does he finally get it?
Yuuki
840258_7_a
Huh?
Leafa
840258_6_a
Even if you cannot speak, I know
you for who you are...
My beautiful savior...
Prince
840258_5_a
...
Little Mermaid
840258_4_a
Yuuki
840258_3_a
Leafa
840258_2_a
bg_event_north_sea_light
Y-You... You're...
Prince
840258_1_a
...
Leafa
840257_30_a
The Little Mermaid is going to
save the drowning prince...
Yuuki
840257_29_a
splutter
Uwaaagh!
H-Help! Someone, help me!
Prince
840257_28_a
...!
Little Mermaid
840257_27_a
Leafa! You didn't stick just his
head under! You chucked his whole
body into the ocean!!
Yuuki
840257_26_a
Take THIIIS!!!
Leafa
840257_25_a
Uwaaagh?!
Prince
840257_24_a
I'm sticking his head in the sea
until this jerk wakes the heck up!
Leafa
840257_23_a
Wah! Leafa, what are you doing?!
Yuuki
840257_22_a
Stupid idiot jerk prince!!
Leafa
840257_21_a
ARGH!! YOU JERK!!
Can't you read the mood here?!
Leafa
840257_20_a
Come! The castle awaits!
Prince
840257_19_a
I know the pain of loving someone
who you know can never be yours.
You're the same as me...
Leafa
840257_18_a
...
Little Mermaid
840257_17_a
I know how much it hurts to want
to say something so bad,
but know that you can't...
Leafa
840257_16_a
I...know how you feel, even if
you can't say it.
Leafa
840257_15_a
So she ended up becoming the
prince's attendant...
Yuuki
840257_14_a
The Little Mermaid!
Leafa
840257_13_a
...
Little Mermaid
840257_12_a
Ah!
Yuuki
840257_11_a
We should just keep the story
going.
Yuuki
840257_10_a
Leafa... There's nothing we
can do.
Yuuki
840257_9_a
Why won't he get it through his
thick skull?!
Leafa
840257_8_a
Ha ha ha! You jest with me!
Now come! The castle awaits!
Prince
840257_7_a
I'm not going to repeat myself
again! You already have
someone who loves you!!
Leafa
840257_6_a
I guess we can't expect any more
out of an NPC lacking AI...
Yuuki
840257_5_a
The prince is just repeating the
same line...
Yuuki
840257_4_a
Ha ha ha! You jest with me!
Now come! The castle awaits!
Prince
840257_3_a
Yuuki
840257_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
I said it wasn't me!!
Leafa
840257_1_a
Ha ha ha! You jest with me!
Now come! The castle awaits!
Prince
840255_26_a
N-No, prince! It wasn't me!
Leafa
840255_25_a
L-Leafa, I think you've taken on
the role of the village girl he
marries...
Yuuki
840255_24_a
You have my eternal gratitude!
Come! I have a feast awaiting you
in my castle!
Prince
840255_23_a
Wait...
WHAAAT?!
Leafa
840255_22_a
Ha ha, that I am! And you are
the fair maiden who saved my
life from the raging sea!
Prince
840255_21_a
Huh?! Hey, aren't you that idiot
I mean, the prince?!
Leafa
840255_20_a
Leafa
840255_19_a
Yuuki
840255_18_a
I've found you!
Prince
840255_17_a
Ahaha, you have a point there.
Yuuki
840255_16_a
She loved him THAT much, and that
idiot prince can't even remember
what she looked like? What a jerk!
Leafa
840255_15_a
But?
Yuuki
840255_14_a
Well, I think I get that...
But...
Leafa
840255_13_a
Yeah.
Yuuki
840255_12_a
So even though she lost
everything, she followed her
heart, and that's what matters?
Leafa
840255_11_a
What she did might seem silly,
but I think the story's trying to
say that love is worth any price.
Yuuki
840255_10_a
People might say love makes you
act like a fool, but I think the
Little Mermaid was really brave.
Yuuki
840255_9_a
When that love wasn't returned and
she had to choose between her life
and his, she chose his.
Yuuki
840255_8_a
The Little Mermaid sacrificed her
mermaid form and her voice just to
see the one she loved.
Yuuki
840255_7_a
I think the lesson is
"love is precious."
Yuuki
840255_6_a
Yeah... But then what did the
author want to teach people with
this one?
Leafa
840255_5_a
I'm pretty sure that's what
they're supposed to do anyway.
Yuuki
840255_4_a
Aren't fairy tales supposed to
teach you something about life,
or serve as warnings?
Yuuki
840255_3_a
Leafa
840255_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
But...it's a fairy tale, right?
Yuuki
840255_1_a
Leafa...
Yuuki
840253_20_a
Not only does her heart get
broken, but she has to die on top
of it. It's too cruel!
Leafa
840253_19_a
Seriously. I really don't want
to see it end like that...
Leafa
840253_18_a
Oh... I never knew the story went
like that. How sad...
Yuuki
840253_17_a
Of course, in the story, she
chooses to become sea foam
rather than hurt her beloved.
Leafa
840253_16_a
The only way to avoid her fate if
the prince marries someone else
is to stab him to death...
Leafa
840253_15_a
Worse, the pact she made with the
Sea Witch says she'll turn into
foam if she doesn't marry him!
Leafa
840253_14_a
the prince mistakes a villager
for the girl who saved him and
marries her.
Leafa
840253_13_a
Because the Little Mermaid is a
tragic story of unrequited love!
In the next part,
Leafa
840253_12_a
Why?
Yuuki
840253_11_a
Maybe she is...
But shouldn't we do something?
Leafa
840253_10_a
Yeah, it is... But look at her
smile. I guess she's happy just
being close to the guy she likes.
Yuuki
840253_9_a
Yuuki
840253_8_a
bg_event_north_sea
Grrr! I can't take it! It's so
frustrating seeing her unable
to say anything!
Leafa
840253_7_a
Excuse me, but I must be off.
I'm looking for someone.
Prince
840253_6_a
...
Little Mermaid
840253_5_a
You shall enter the castle's
employ. Someone, see to her.
Prince
840253_4_a
Can you not speak? Hmm...
Very well. You don't seem
like a bad person.
Prince
840253_3_a
...
Little Mermaid
840253_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
You wish to work here at
the castle?
Prince
840253_1_a
There she goes!
Quick, follow her!
Leafa
840251_24_a
Y-Yeah, that sounds right!
Yuuki
840251_23_a
Then we're halfway through the
story. This part comes after she
saves the Prince from drowning.
Leafa
840251_22_a
If the Little Mermaid's coming up
onto land...
Leafa
840251_21_a
Leafa
840251_20_a
Whoa! Her tail turned into legs!
Yuuki
840251_19_a
Yuuki
840251_18_a
Oh yeah! Good thinking!
Leafa
840251_17_a
I don't think she wants anyone to
see her assume her disguise!
Yuuki
840251_16_a
If I remember right, she disguises
herself as a human so she can see
the world above water.
Yuuki
840251_15_a
Duh! That's gotta be the
Little Mermaid!
Yuuki
840251_14_a
But why?
Leafa
840251_13_a
L-Leafa! Quick! Hide!
Yuuki
840251_12_a
H-H-Her feet! They're not feet!
They're a fish! I mean she's a
fish! I mean... MERMAID?!
Leafa
840251_11_a
Whoa, you're right!
W-Wait a sec!!
Yuuki
840251_10_a
Yuuki
840251_9_a
Wow! A really, really pretty girl
just came out of the ocean!
Leafa
840251_8_a
...
???
840251_7_a
Leafa
840251_6_a
Speaking of fairy tales, Hans
Christian Andersen's most famous
ocean fairy tale was
Yuuki
840251_5_a
Agreed! Now let's just hope we
have our own fairy tale adventure
while we're out here!
Leafa
840251_4_a
Yeah, woohoo! Andersen Island's
beach is super pretty!
Yuuki
840251_3_a
Yuuki
840251_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Wow! Look, the ocean! We're here!
Leafa
840251_1_a
I know!
Silica
840248_30_a
Hehe, you've got yourself a great
ally, Silica.
Kirito
840248_29_a
Chirp!
Pina
840248_28_a
no matter how popular she gets?
Kirito
840248_27_a
You wanted Silica to know that you
aren't going to leave like
in SAO,
Kirito
840248_26_a
So you were worried too, huh Pina?
Kirito
840248_25_a
Thank you so much!
Silica
840248_24_a
Of course.
Kirito
840248_23_a
Can I come back and sing with you
guys?
Silica
840248_22_a
Yeah. Hey, um, Kirito? I'm really
sorry for taking so much time
off from the group, but...
Silica
840248_21_a
I think she agrees with you.
Kirito
840248_20_a
Chiiiirp chirp!
Pina
840248_19_a
Aww...
Kirito
840248_18_a
Like, "Don't get yourself down,
Silica. I'm not going to die
on you again."
Silica
840248_17_a
Yeah. I felt like she was trying
to tell me something.
Silica
840248_16_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
840248_15_a
Haha, so that's how it was.
So the MVP award goes to Pina
this time around!
Kirito
840248_14_a
And then you showed up, and I knew
we had a chance!
Silica
840248_13_a
How could I give up, watching
her fight like that?
Silica
840248_12_a
Chirp!
Pina
840248_11_a
Yep, and then Pina told me not
to give up, either.
Silica
840248_10_a
Oh yeah?
Kirito
840248_9_a
But Pina kept fighting.
Silica
840248_8_a
I knew I didn't stand a chance
fighting it alone...
Silica
840248_7_a
I had actually given up, too.
Silica
840248_6_a
You really held your own there!
I didn't think I'd make it in time
to help.
Kirito
840248_5_a
Kirito...
Silica
840248_4_a
Pina
840248_3_a
Silica
840248_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Whew... I honestly didn't think we
could pull that off.
Kirito
840248_1_a
O-Okay! I'll keep fighting!
Silica
840247_26_a
CHIRP!!
Pina
840247_25_a
What's that? "Don't give up"?
Silica
840247_24_a
Chirp! CHIRP CHIRP!
Pina
840247_23_a
It can't keep up!
Pina's too fast for it!
Silica
840247_22_a
GRUH? GRAAAGH!
Monster
840247_21_a
CHIRP! CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!
Pina
840247_20_a
Pina, what're you doing?!
Silica
840247_19_a
CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!!
Pina
840247_18_a
This is it, Pina...
Silica
840247_17_a
Pina
840247_16_a
Silica
840247_15_a
GRAAAAAAH!
Monster
840247_14_a
Does she really think she can take
it alone? I'll
never reach her in time!
Kirito
840247_13_a
What the heck is Silica doing
out here fighting a super rare
monster like that?!
Kirito
840247_12_a
Pina
840247_11_a
We were pretty underprepared for
this one...
Silica
840247_10_a
We're almost out of HP and MP,
and fresh out of potions...
Silica
840247_9_a
Sorry Pina, we can't handle an
enemy like this on our own!
Silica
840247_8_a
Chirp!
Pina
840247_7_a
Pina
840247_6_a
I didn't think enemies as tough
as you spawned around here!
Silica
840247_5_a
Was that who I think it was?!
Kirito
840247_4_a
Gah! This one's tough!
???
840247_3_a
Grrrooooooaaaaaar!
???
840247_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Well, this is about where she'd
be, based on what Sugu said.
Kirito
840247_1_a
...
Kazuto
840245_32_a
Well... You've got me there.
Suguha
840245_31_a
What could we possibly say that
would erase that trauma?
Kazuto
840245_30_a
She's closing herself off because
she regrets letting Pina die
back then.
Kazuto
840245_29_a
Why not? We won't know until we
try, anyway!
Suguha
840245_28_a
Hmm... I don't think saying that
will be enough...
Kazuto
840245_27_a
So we all just have to convince
her that something like that
won't happen again!
Suguha
840245_26_a
But as far as I can tell from what
you've said, it sounds like she
really, really wants to sing.
Kazuto
840245_25_a
Kazuto
840245_24_a
Ahhh, so she's having flashbacks
to SAO, huh? When she lost Pina?
Suguha
840245_23_a
Well...yeah, actually.
Kazuto
840245_22_a
What happened? Is there a reason
she hasn't been playing Pop Star
Online lately?
Suguha
840245_21_a
Ah, I can see that, now that you
mention it.
Kazuto
840245_20_a
She mentioned that she really
wanted to be like Yuna from
Ordinal Scale.
Suguha
840245_19_a
Fine! She had a lot of fun.
She really likes to sing.
Suguha
840245_18_a
And how was she?
Kazuto
840245_17_a
and followed that up with some
karaoke.
Suguha
840245_16_a
But we went to a concert at one
of the venues nearby,
Suguha
840245_15_a
Nothing in particular stood out
to me.
Suguha
840245_14_a
So what's on her mind, then?
Kazuto
840245_13_a
Turns out she's been playing a lot
of ALO instead. I didn't get
a chance to ask why.
Suguha
840245_12_a
Yeah.
Kazuto
840245_11_a
Well, you know how she hasn't been
playing a lot of Pop Star Online?
Suguha
840245_10_a
Oh yeah? How's Silica doing?
Er, Keiko...
Kazuto
840245_9_a
Hah! I really had you going there!
I was just out with Keiko!
Suguha
840245_8_a
Well yeah, but...
Kazuto
840245_7_a
I'm home by curfew.
Isn't that enough for you, DAD?
Suguha
840245_6_a
UGH, quit poking your nose into
my business!
Suguha
840245_5_a
You're getting home late.
Were you out doing something?
Kazuto
840245_4_a
Hi Kazuto.
Suguha
840245_3_a
Suguha
840245_2_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
Hey, Sugu.
Kazuto
840245_1_a
You mean that, Kirito...?
Silica
840243_23_a
we're not in a position
to force you.
Kirito
840243_22_a
Silica, if you're worried about
continuing on with the game,
Kirito
840243_21_a
Actually, this is a big deal for
her.
Kirito
840243_20_a
You don't need to worry, Silica.
Does she, Kirito?
Liz
840243_19_a
Liz! Kirito!
Silica
840243_18_a
I didn't think you'd actually
logged out.
Kirito
840243_17_a
Silica
840243_16_a
Kirito
840243_15_a
Hey, Silica.
Liz
840243_14_a
Huh? Who's there?!
Silica
840243_13_a
So THAT'S what's eating you!
???
840243_12_a
But that doesn't change the fact
that I'm second-guessing
everything now.
Silica
840243_11_a
Hehe, oh no? Is that not how it
went? Well, thank you for saying
so.
Silica
840243_10_a
Chirp!
Pina
840243_9_a
That's how I ended up nearly
losing you in the first place.
Silica
840243_8_a
People fawn over me because they
think I'm really young, and I'm
letting it go to my head.
Silica
840243_7_a
Chirp...?
Pina
840243_6_a
I'm in the exact same situation
as I was before, aren't I?
Silica
840243_5_a
I wasn't thinking about it when I
was with everybody else, but...
Silica
840243_4_a
Chirp?
Pina

Hey, Pina?

Kirito

Asuna
840241_23_a
Kirito
840241_22_a
What was that all about?
Liz
840241_21_a
Silica
840241_20_a
Oh? Okay... Well, bye, I guess.
Kirito
840241_19_a
I, um, have something to take care
of in the real world, so I'm going
to log out now! Bye!
Silica
840241_18_a
It's fine. I'm fine.
Silica
840241_17_a
Is everything okay, Silica?
Kirito
840241_16_a
...
Silica
840241_15_a
Indeed. It's super cute! The fans
probably think of her like their
little sister.
Asuna
840241_14_a
Silica's avatar was bound to be
popular among a certain segment
of the fan base.
Sinon
840241_13_a
I'm not surprised at all.
Sinon
840241_12_a
Y-You really think so?
Silica
840241_11_a
Yeah, seriously! I heard a lot of
fans calling her name!
Leafa
840241_10_a
That's another one in the books!
Was it just me, or was that crowd
the Silica fan club today?
Liz
840241_9_a
Thanks, Kirito!
Silica

Well done, guys.

Thank you so much!

You were awesome again today!

Silicaaaaaa!!
Spectators
840241_1_a
Heh. You know it.
Sinon
840238_28_a
Ahaha, now that's my Sinon.
No mercy.
Alicia
840238_27_a
You messed with me on multiple
levels AND ferreted out my secret.
I expect an expensive apology.
Sinon
840238_26_a
Huh?
Alicia
840238_25_a
sigh
Well, what are you getting me?
Sinon
840238_24_a
Hehe... Already forgotten.
I'll keep your secret safe, Sinon.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Alicia
840238_23_a
Forget it!
Forget I said anything!
Sinon
840238_22_a
Wait, no!
I did not just say that!!
Sinon
840238_21_a
You can say that again...
Sinon
840238_20_a
Young love is a bittersweet thing.
Alicia
840238_19_a
Sinon...
Alicia
840238_18_a
That's all...
Sinon
840238_17_a
I was thinking that he seemed so
inspired when he saw Asuna in that
outfit...
Sinon
840238_16_a
It's just...
Sinon
840238_15_a
...
Sinon
840238_14_a
If you need some advice, I'd be
glad to help.
Alicia
840238_13_a
Oh, reaaally? Come on now. You're
not fooling me! Spill!
Alicia
840238_12_a
N-No reason...
Just curious, that's all...
Sinon
840238_11_a
So...why were you so interested in
that video of Asuna and Yui in
those cheerleader outfits?
Alicia
840238_10_a
I am not happy right now.
Not happy at all.
Sinon
840238_9_a
Seriously, sorry about that!
I'll make it up to you, promise!
Alicia
840238_8_a
Aliciiia! Just whose fault was it
that I had to wear that?!
Sinon
840238_7_a
Hahaha, oh, that was great. Sorry!
I just couldn't help myself!
You were just so adorable, Sinon!
Alicia
840238_6_a
YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS WAY
TOO MUCH!
Sinon
840238_5_a
AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Alicia
840238_4_a
Alicia! Not cool!
Sinon
840238_3_a
Sinon
840238_2_a
bg_21_alne_sunset
Ahahahaha!
Alicia
840238_1_a
Uh...b-but...I...
I...b-but...err...
Sinon
840237_47_a
I won't upload it anywhere or
anything, I promise! It'll be my
own private treasure!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_46_a
So I would really love it if I
could have a photo of us together
with you wearing it!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_45_a
I think you'd look just adorable
in it! It's totally you!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_44_a
Do what now?
Sinon
840237_43_a
So, umm... If it's not too much
trouble, could you try it on?
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_42_a
Y-You are?! That's wonderful!
I'm so happy you like it!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_41_a
I'm...very happy. I am.
Sinon
840237_40_a
Thank you. I really wanted this
outfit.
Sinon
840237_39_a
Oh, no problem at all.
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_38_a
bg_21_alne_sunset
Sorry for the wait.
Sinon
840237_37_a
Okay...
Alicia
840237_36_a
I don't want to hurt her feelings,
and my own feelings aren't really
relevant here.
Sinon
840237_35_a
But, Sinon...
Alicia
840237_34_a
I...well... I'll handle this.
Somehow.
Sinon
840237_33_a
Huh?
Alicia
840237_32_a
W-Wait!
Sinon
840237_31_a
She's going to be seriously
disappointed... I've got to go
apologize to her...
Alicia
840237_30_a
Wait a sec... If that girl finds
out you don't want that present
she worked so hard to get you...
Alicia
840237_29_a
W-Well, you see...
Sinon
840237_28_a
Oh, shoot... Sorry, Sinon...
But then why were you staring at
Asuna like that?
Alicia
840237_27_a
NO! I most certainly did NOT.
Sinon
840237_26_a
Yeah, but...huh? So, let me get
this straight. You're telling me
you really didn't want one?
Alicia
840237_25_a
Urk...!
You saw that?!
Sinon
840237_24_a
I was sure you were jealous of how
good she looked in it and wanted
one of your own!
Alicia
840237_23_a
Wait, seriously? But you were so
intent on that video of Asuna in
her cheerleader outfit!
Alicia
840237_22_a
When did I say I wanted one of
these things?! I do NOT want a
cheerleader outfit!!
Sinon
840237_21_a
bg_21_alne_sunset
Just what the heck are you trying
to pull?!
Sinon
840237_20_a
Hmm? What's with the frown?
Alicia
840237_19_a
Alicia. Over here. Now.
Sinon
840237_18_a
Y-Yes, that's right!
Thank you again!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_17_a
Oh, of course! You must be giving
Sinon that present I told you to
get her!
Alicia
840237_16_a
Aliciaaa...!
Sinon
840237_15_a
What are you two doing here?
Alicia
840237_14_a
Sinon
840237_13_a
Hmm?
Oh, it's you two!
Alicia
840237_12_a
Uh... Err...
Well...
Sinon
840237_11_a
Y-Yes, it is.
You wanted this, right?
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_10_a
W-Wait, this is a...
cheerleader outfit?!
Sinon
840237_9_a
She WHAT?!
Sinon
840237_8_a
Alicia told me that you would love
this, so I got you one...
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_7_a
I appreciate the sentiment, but I
don't need
Sinon
840237_6_a
You were kind enough to give me
your autograph, so I wanted to get
you something in return!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_5_a
Y-Yes, I'm your biggest fan!
Alicia introduced us not too long
ago!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_4_a
Huh? Oh, right. You're that girl.
Sinon
840237_3_a
Sinon
840237_2_a
bg_21_alne_sunset
S-Sinon! Th-This is for you!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840237_1_a
Well... I'm not too sure about
that...
Silica
840235_22_a
I know, right?! Anyone who stares
like that at something has to want
it!
Alicia
840235_21_a
Yes, she was staring at Asuna and
Yui's outfits really intently,
but I don't thi
Silica
840235_20_a
Well, I figured she wanted one for
herself. Her eyes were practically
popping out of her head!
Alicia
840235_19_a
Um, yeah?
Silica
840235_18_a
Remember how Sinon was staring at
Asuna's cheerleader outfit nonstop
last time we hung out?
Alicia
840235_17_a
There's a piece of equipment that
Sinon wants...?
Silica
840235_16_a
so I told her about that piece of
equipment Sinon's been drooling
over.
Alicia
840235_15_a
Oh yeah, that girl's a super
Sinon fan. She wanted to get Sinon
a present,
Alicia
840235_14_a
And why was that Cait Sith girl
running like she'd just gotten the
world's best present?
Silica
840235_13_a
Oh, hi Silica!
Alicia
840235_12_a
Alicia
840235_11_a
Alicia... Why are you frolicking?
Silica
840235_10_a
Well well, another day, another
good deed! It feels great to be so
good!
Alicia
840235_9_a
Thanks!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840235_8_a
Sure! Good luck!
Alicia
840235_7_a
I'm going to go find it and give
it to Sinon as a present!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840235_6_a
Alicia, thank you so much!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840235_5_a
If you want to get her a present,
this is it! I guarantee it!
Alicia
840235_4_a
Oh yeah, totally!
Alicia
840235_3_a
Alicia
840235_2_a
bg_21_alne
So... Sinon said she wanted this
piece of equipment?
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840235_1_a
Hmm...
Alicia
840233_30_a
...
Alicia
840233_29_a
Silica
840233_28_a
Yeah.
Sinon
840233_27_a
Okay, if that's how you want it...
Shall we go?
Silica
840233_26_a
I already read it, anyway.
Sinon
840233_25_a
N-No, I wasn't that interested in
it at all. Besides, the summary's
up on MMO Tomorrow's page.
Sinon
840233_24_a
Should we stay here until it's
over?
Silica
840233_23_a
Sinon, you want to watch the
interview, don't you?
Silica
840233_22_a
...
Sinon
840233_21_a
Good point. Everyone's curious to
find out more about the girl who won
the rare prize.
Sinon
840233_20_a
In that sense, interviewing her
was a smart choice to appeal to
their viewers.
Silica
840233_19_a
It was Yui! Everyone's talking
about her. The new, improved,
battle-ready NPC!
Silica
840233_18_a
Ahaha, yeah. Well, either way,
it wasn't players like Kirito who
caused a stir...
Silica
840233_17_a
Yeah, he mentioned that. Still,
interviewing people who weren't in
the competition? Odd choice.
Sinon
840233_16_a
He said he didn't want to be in
the spotlight, so he asked them to
fill in for him.
Silica
840233_15_a
Hehe, maybe. Anyway, I heard Asuna
and Yui are taking Kirito's place
in the interview.
Silica
840233_14_a
Silica
840233_13_a
bg_21_alne
Heh, they're still in those
cheerleading outfits. I guess they
must like them, huh?
Sinon
840233_12_a
Hello, everyone. My name is Yui!
I hope you all have a wonderful
day!
Yui (TV)
840233_11_a
This adorable little girl is Yui.
The competition prize made it so
she can fight with us now.
Asuna (TV)
840233_10_a
Yui (TV)
840233_9_a
bg_18_tower_road
I didn't compete myself, but I'm
here on behalf of my friend who
did.
Asuna (TV)
840233_8_a
Yeah, I believe that's right.
Silica
840233_7_a
I think they said it was for
MMO Tomorrow?
Sinon
840233_6_a
Well, I suppose it is. That's the
post-competition interview they
had, right?
Sinon
840233_5_a
Take a closer look!
It's Asuna and Yui!
Silica
840233_4_a
The video on that monitor?
Yeah, I see it. So?
Sinon
840233_3_a
Sinon
840233_2_a
bg_21_alne
Hey Sinon!
Look at that.
Silica
840233_1_a
Nuh-uh, not going to happen.
Sinon
840231_22_a
Ahaha! You're a celebrity, Sinon!
Might want to start carrying pen
and paper for all your fans!
Alicia
840231_21_a
Wait a sec... What am I supposed
to autograph here?
Sinon
840231_20_a
Th-Thank you so, so much!
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840231_19_a
I wasn't worried about that...
Eh, whatever. Autograph, right?
Sure.
Sinon
840231_18_a
She may be a fan, but she's not
foaming at the mouth. She won't
try to pull anything weird.
Alicia
840231_17_a
Don't worry, Sinon! This gal
here's diligent, serious, and
sensible.
Alicia
840231_16_a
N-No, I'm not mad, exactly...
It's just...
Sinon
840231_15_a
S-Sorry...
I hope you're not mad...
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840231_14_a
I have fans?!
That's news to me...
Sinon
840231_13_a
Let's just say you have a lot of
fans.
Alicia
840231_12_a
Your sniping skills are renowned
throughout ALO, and you have that
cool, composed demeanor in battle.
Alicia
840231_11_a
What?!
Sinon
840231_10_a
Ahahaha! There are tons of kids
who look up to you: Sinon,
Cait Sith archer extraordinaire!
Alicia
840231_9_a
Wait a sec, back up!
Alicia, explain!
Sinon
840231_8_a
Uh, hi... Nice to meet you too...
Sinon
840231_7_a
H-Hi... Nice to meet you...
Cait Sith Sinon Fangirl
840231_6_a
Are you kidding me?!
Sinon
840231_5_a
I have a Cait Sith girl here who
absolutely needs your autograph.
Alicia
840231_4_a
You need me for something, Alicia?
Sinon
840231_3_a
Sinon
840231_2_a
bg_21_alne
There you are, Sinon!
I finally found you.
Alicia
840231_1_a
Yeah, I'm totally down.
Liz
840228_28_a
Hehe, okay!
Leafa
840228_27_a
Let's get everyone together and
play OS again tomorrow night!
Silica
840228_26_a
Yeah! Wow, just talking about OS
makes me want to play it again!
Silica
840228_25_a
It's like attending a concert
while playing a game! That's what
I call a two-for-one deal!
Liz
840228_24_a
Well, her songs buff you during
battles, which helps player
morale for sure.
Liz
840228_23_a
She's already got quite the
reputation online! I bet people
will play just to see her.
Leafa
840228_22_a
Yuna's just that good!
Liz
840228_21_a
Hehe, how convenient!
But I know you're not
exaggerating.
Liz
840228_20_a
But as soon as I saw Yuna,
all of that fear just disappeared!
Silica
840228_19_a
I thought it would be scarier than
VR, I really did.
Silica
840228_18_a
Hehehe... Is it that obvious?
Silica
840228_17_a
Remember how timid she was when
we started?
Leafa
840228_16_a
Ha ha, probably not! Silica's done
a total 180 since we started
the game!
Leafa
840228_15_a
Ha ha, I don't think Pina gets it.
Liz
840228_14_a
Chirp...?
Pina
840228_13_a
She was a real diva!
Silica
840228_12_a
She looks great, and she's got a
beautiful voice. Even her dance
moves were incredible!
Silica
840228_11_a
Yuna's part of OS. People seem
to think she might be some sort
of AR idol!
Silica
840228_10_a
You see, Pina, someone named Yuna
helped us in the game we were
just playing.
Silica
840228_9_a
Hahaha! Pina says I'm acting
weird all of a sudden.
Leafa
840228_8_a
Chirp?
Pina
840228_7_a
I wonder if she'll grace us with
her presence again...
Silica
840228_6_a
Yeah, that was crazy.
Liz
840228_5_a
I loved Yuna's song!
Silica
840228_4_a
Leafa
840228_3_a
Liz
840228_2_a
bg_os_cafe
Wheeew! That was incredible!
Silica
840228_1_a
Roger that!
Silica
840227_28_a
You're right! Let's hit 'em with
everything we've got!
Leafa
840227_27_a
This is a golden opportunity!
We can't let it get away!
Liz
840227_26_a
Is the song doing all that?
Silica
840227_25_a
She's right!
We're even getting a buff!
Silica
840227_24_a
We're getting healed!
Liz
840227_23_a
Guys, look at your HP gauges!
Liz
840227_22_a
Silica
840227_21_a_2
Liz
840227_21_a_1
Uh... Did she just start singing?!
Leafa
840227_21_a
La la laa!
???
840227_20_a
Liz
840227_19_a_1
C-Could it be another player?
Silica
840227_19_a
Silica
840227_18_a_1
Who the heck is that?!
Liz
840227_18_a
Come now!
Don't give up that easily!
???
840227_17_a
Liz
840227_16_a_2
Silica
840227_16_a_1
What's with all this light?
Leafa
840227_16_a
Whoa!
Silica
840227_15_a
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Silica
840227_14_a
Get out of its range and heal!
Liz
840227_13_a
F-Fall back! We've got no other
choice!
Liz
840227_12_a
Gryaaaah!
Monster
840227_11_a
Urgh...
Liz
840227_10_a
I don't have a lot of HP left
either!
Silica
840227_9_a
Seriously! Let the newbies catch
their breaths, would you!
Leafa
840227_8_a
Geez! Don't they know we're first-
timers? What's with all the
monsters?!
Liz
840227_7_a
Say what?!
Leafa
840227_6_a
A-Another one just spawned!
Silica
840227_5_a
Liz
840227_4_a
Leafa
840227_3_a
Silica
840227_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Graaaaaargh!
Monster
840227_1_a
Okay!
Silica
840225_24_a
We can warm up by taking out that
monster together!
Leafa
840225_23_a
Alright then, Silica, let's go!
Leafa
840225_22_a
Me too!
Leafa
840225_21_a
Okay then, say no more!
I'm convinced!
Liz
840225_20_a
I'm not going to chicken out right
at the beginning!
Silica
840225_19_a
Besides, I just got this brand new
system so I could play with
you guys!
Silica
840225_18_a
But it's nothing compared to SAO.
Silica
840225_17_a
Y-Yeah...
It's definitely scary...
Silica
840225_16_a
Yeah, what Liz said.
You okay, Silica?
Leafa
840225_15_a
It's-whoa-just a game, after all.
Liz
840225_14_a
You don't have to force yourself
to play something that terrifies
you!
Liz
840225_13_a
You can take a break if it's too
much, y'know.
Liz
840225_12_a
It really is...ha. Ha ha...
Silica
840225_11_a
Yeah, the realism is off the
charts compared to VR!
Leafa
840225_10_a
Y-Yeah...! I just got a little
scared. That monster felt like it
was RIGHT HERE!
Silica
840225_9_a
You okay, Silica?!
Liz
840225_8_a
Waaah!
Silica
840225_7_a
It's just as real as they claimed!
This is intense on a whole new
level!
Leafa
840225_6_a
S-So, this is Ordinal Scale, huh!
Liz
840225_5_a
Silica
840225_4_a
Leafa

bg_os_town_2
Graaaaaaah!
Monster
840225_1_a
Chiiiirp!
Pina
840223_21_a
I've got to ask Mom and Dad if
they'll buy the Augma for me!
Silica
840223_20_a
Alright, good talk, Pina.
I'd better log out.
Silica
840223_19_a
I guess as long as I stick with
everyone, I've got nothing to
worry about.
Silica
840223_18_a
Liz and Leafa have more than
enough excitement to make up for
him, though.
Silica
840223_17_a
Yeah, Kirito doesn't seem to be
very excited about it, does he?
Silica
840223_16_a
Hehe, trying to cheer me on?
Thanks.
Silica
840223_15_a
Ch-Chirp!
Pina
840223_14_a
Hahaha! Sorry, Pina. I overreacted
a bit there.
Silica
840223_13_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
840223_12_a
But I guess it'd only be natural
for me to fight as Keiko Ayano
in an AR game...
Silica
840223_11_a
Chirp...
Pina
840223_10_a
That's a little scary when you
think about it.
Silica
840223_9_a
I mean, you could use video
effects and such, but it's still
your body...
Silica
840223_8_a
Which means you've got to show
people what you really look
like...
Silica
840223_7_a
Well, if the game world is put
over top of the real world, you
become your avatar, right?
Silica
840223_6_a
Chirp chirp?
Pina
840223_5_a
Do you think AR games are safe?
Silica
840223_4_a
Chirp!
Pina
840223_3_a
Pina
840223_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Hey, Pina?
Silica
840223_1_a
Y-Yeah...
Silica
840221_20_a
Let's ask Asuna and Sinon too!
I'm actually getting kind of
excited for it!
Liz
840221_19_a
Hehe, let us know how that goes.
Leafa
840221_18_a
I'm pretty sure they'll get it for
me, but you never know...
Silica
840221_17_a
Well, maybe if I ask my parents...
Silica
840221_16_a
Me? Uhm...
Silica
840221_15_a
You'll get it too, won't you,
Silica?
Leafa
840221_14_a
Huh... Weird.
Liz
840221_13_a
But he said he doesn't think he'll
play it much.
Leafa
840221_12_a
Nope. He'll get it because it's a
new piece of hardware, obviously.
Leafa
840221_11_a
Really?
Liz
840221_10_a
Yeah, though he doesn't seem SUPER
excited about it for some reason.
Leafa
840221_9_a
Maybe I'll have to pick one up
myself!
Liz
840221_7_a_1
Silica
840221_8_a
Hehe, so Kirito's getting one too?
it seems like there's a rumour about
it being distributed at our school
Liz
840221_7_a
Augma, the wearable AR device!
Leafa
840221_6_a
I know! Kirito said he'll get one
to check it out, and I'm totally
planning to get one too.
Leafa
840221_5_a
It really does! I'm amazed that
you can actually have VR-quality
battles in the real world!
Liz
840221_4_a
Silica
840221_3_a

840221_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Well?! Doesn't it look awesome?!
Leafa
840221_1_a
So now I have to treat ALL THREE
of you?! Give me a break!
Kirito
840188_50_a
Hehe, I think you've just got to
bite the bullet here. Oh, and I
wouldn't mind some cake, either...
Asuna
840188_49_a
Asuna
840188_48_a
You've gotta be kidding me...
Kirito
840188_47_a
Ooh, yes! Great idea, Liz!
Silica
840188_46_a
Silica
840188_45_a
Hmm. We'll call it even if you
treat us to all-you-can-eat cake
at that famous pastry shop!
Liz
840188_44_a
Asuna
840188_43_a
Well, what else was I supposed
to do?!
Kirito
840188_42_a
Y-Yeah! That was a mean trick
to pull on us!
Silica
840188_41_a
I just can't believe we got played
like that! Right into your hands!
Liz
840188_40_a
Silica
840188_39_a
We... Well yeah, but
Liz
840188_38_a
Asuna
840188_37_a
W-Well, so what if I did?
You made up, didn't you?
Kirito
840188_36_a
Silica
840188_35_a
Oh, don't play dumb! We all saw
you tense up just now!
Liz
840188_34_a
Asuna
840188_33_a
N-No way! Y-You're reading into
things, Liz! I would never
Kirito
840188_32_a
Liz
840188_31_a
Oh my gosh! Is that true?!
Silica
840188_30_a
Asuna
840188_29_a
gulp
Kirito
840188_28_a
You put us in a situation where we
HAD to work together so we'd
make up! I'm right, aren't I?
Liz
840188_27_a
Liz
840188_26_a
Yeah, what are you talking about,
Liz?
Silica
840188_25_a
Asuna
840188_24_a
Say what?
Kirito
840188_23_a
Silica
840188_22_a
This was your plan all along,
wasn't it? To FORCE us to get back
on good terms with each other!
Liz
840188_21_a
Asuna
840188_20_a
Huh...?
Kirito
840188_19_a
Silica
840188_18_a
Yeah, but now someone else is in
trouble... Heeey, Kiritooo...?
Liz
840188_17_a
Kirito
840188_16_a
And that's great! I'm so glad
you're both getting along again!
Asuna
840188_15_a
I-I feel so bad... But we were
able to make up!
Silica
840188_14_a
Silica
840188_13_a
Sorry to drag you both into
this...
Liz
840188_12_a
...
Kirito
840188_11_a
Oh, you two...
Asuna
840188_9_a
Kirito
840188_10_a
I-I should be the one apologizing!
I don't know why I was so stubborn
about this... I'm sorry...
Liz
840188_8_a
I'm sorry for acting so childish,
guys. That must've made things
miserable...
Silica
840188_7_a
It made me realize that nothing
beats solid teamwork.
Silica
840188_6_a
Y-You were awesome too, Liz! It
was really great to get to team up
with you...
Silica
840188_5_a
Ah, got it: "dignified!"
That was awesome, Silica.
Liz
840188_4_a
That costume looked pretty...
Hmmm, "cute" is the wrong
word... Not "valiant," either...
Liz
840188_3_a
Silica
840188_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Y-You know, during that fight...

840188_1_a
...
Silica

840187_26_a
...
Kirito
840187_25_a
Y-You're welcome. I'm glad we won!
Silica
840187_24_a
Yeah...
Thanks, Silica.

840187_23_a
Did we kill it?!
Kirito
840187_22_a
GRAAAWRRR!!
Monster
840187_21_a
HAAAAH!!
Silica
840187_20_a
CHIIIIIRP!
Pina
840187_19_a
Got it!
Go for it, Pina!
Silica
840187_18_a
Now, Silica!
Liz
840187_17_a
Grgyaaa?!
Monster
840187_16_a
Take THAT!
Liz
840187_15_a
We got it, we got it!
Come on!
Liz
840187_14_a
I hope you guys aren't planning on
giggling that monster to death!
Kirito
840187_13_a
Hehe, you know, that's a really
good question!
Silica
840187_12_a
Ahaha, seriously? So are they fire
or water?
Liz
840187_11_a
You know, Pina can breathe fire
bubbles when I've got this item
equipped!
Silica
840187_10_a
Of course!
Silica
840187_9_a
Silica, can you have Pina cover me
with her bubbles? I'm gonna drain
its HP with a Strike Attack!
Liz
840187_8_a
Slashing and Piercing Attacks
aren't doing much good against
it...
Liz
840187_7_a
Okay!
Silica
840187_6_a
Silica, Liz! You two go after
that one!
Kirito
840187_5_a

Kirito

bg_18_mountain
GRAAAAAGHH!!
Monster
840187_1_a
Yeah, I have just the one.
Kirito
840185_20_a
Have you already decided which
quest we'll be doing, Kirito?
Silica
840185_19_a
Okay then! To the quest!
Liz
840185_18_a
I-I suppose...
Alright, fine.
Silica
840185_17_a
Besides, he can see if it looks
good during a fight, too, and
include that in his decision.
Liz
840185_16_a
What's the harm in
double-checking?
Liz
840185_15_a
But I've already fought in it
once, and this is just about
whether or not it's cute!
Silica
840185_14_a
That way I can see how Silica
fights with that item equipped,
and form my opinion that way.
Kirito
840185_13_a
I was thinking of having the two
of you come on a quest with me.
Kirito
840185_12_a
And just how will you do that?
Liz
840185_11_a
So I'm just going to appraise it
like I would any other piece
of equipment.
Kirito
840185_10_a
I seriously don't have the first
clue about fashion or anything
like that...
Kirito
840185_9_a
O-Okay, if that's what you want...
But first, let me just say...
Kirito
840185_8_a
Yeah! Be brutally honest!
Silica
840185_7_a
And don't try to dodge the
question with some stupid
non-answer!
Liz
840185_6_a
Um...
Kirito
840185_5_a
Do you think this outfit
is cute?
Silica
840185_4_a
Kirito
840185_3_a
Silica
840185_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
We really want to know, Kirito.
Liz
840185_1_a
I have a feeling this isn't
going to end well...
Kirito
840183_15_a
And I warned them, but they just
won't let it go until they
hear what you think.
Asuna
840183_14_a
Oof! You don't have to be
so cruel about it...
Kirito
840183_13_a
I know, your idea of "fashion" is
wearing all black, all the time.
Asuna
840183_12_a
I understand. I just don't know
how much help I'll really be...
Kirito
840183_11_a
Honestly, I don't get it either,
but they're my friends, so I had
to come ask you.
Asuna
840183_10_a
They seemed to think the only way
to decide for certain was to ask
an outside party.
Asuna
840183_9_a
Wh-What?! In what universe is THAT
a good idea?!
Kirito
840183_8_a
See, they just wouldn't give it a
rest, and in the end they decided
they wanted your opinion.
Asuna
840183_7_a
Yeah... And that's why I owe you
an apology...
Asuna
840183_6_a
I'm a total newb when it comes to
fashion sense.
Kirito
840183_5_a
Ah... I'm not even going to
pretend I understand that.
Kirito
840183_4_a
Yeah... Specifically whether or
not it's a good design...
Asuna
840183_3_a
Asuna
840183_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Really...? Liz and Silica got into
a fight over that Flamefox costume?
Kirito
840183_1_a
Come on, you two,
no need to get upset...
Asuna
840181_18_a
I'm not trying to spoil it! You
were the one who wanted to know
what I thought in the first place!
Liz
840181_17_a
Grrrrr! Why do you have to open
your big mouth and spoil
everything?!
Silica
840181_16_a
I guess... Personally I just think
mixing them like that makes for
poor craftsmanship...
Liz
840181_15_a
N-Not at all! Cuteness totally
stacks! There's no such thing as
too much!
Silica
840181_14_a
A shrine maiden wearing a mini
skirt AND animal ears just seems
like, I dunno... Overkill?
Liz
840181_13_a
I mean, it's cute and all,
but... Well...
Liz
840181_12_a
Don't you like it, Liz?
Silica
840181_11_a
I suppose you could say that,
but I feel like they've been
around for a while now...
Asuna
840181_10_a
Yeaaah... I guess shrine maiden
mini-skirts are all the rage
now, huh?
Liz
840181_9_a
I do! It's strong AND adorable!
Don't you think?
Silica
840181_8_a
Hehe, you really like it, huh?
Asuna
840181_7_a
That it is!
Silica
840181_6_a
The one from Dogfight Derby!
Liz
840181_5_a
Oh hey, that's the new item
you got, isn't it?

bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Ehehe...
Silica

It's just the cherry on top of my
ninja sundae!
Yuuki
840178_20_a
Hehe, thank you. I can't believe
I'm getting a Kunoichi!
Yuuki
840178_19_a
Ha ha... Alright, if you insist.
Man
840178_18_a
I have to have it! I changed my
mind, let's duel!
Yuuki
840178_17_a
K-Kunoichi?! Then I'd really be
a ninja!
Yuuki
840178_16_a
You get an item called Kunoichi.
But if you're okay without it
Man
840178_15_a
Are you serious? But there's a
quest that rewards you for winning
a duel here...
Man
840178_14_a
I had a lot of fun, so I don't
really care one way or another.
Yuuki
840178_13_a
What?
Man
840178_12_a
Oh, about that... It's fine.
Yuuki
840178_11_a
Alright, let's get that duel set
up. Don't attack me. I'm gonna
withdraw right away.
Man
840178_10_a
sigh
I guess you beat me this
time. Alright, I lose.
Man
840178_9_a
Yep.
Yuuki
840178_8_a
So that's what you were doing
here...
Man
840178_7_a
Memorizing every twist and turn
made it feel like I was turning
into a ninja or something, hehe.
Yuuki
840178_6_a
I figured fighting would be easier
if I knew my way around, so I
studied the heck outa this place.
Yuuki
840178_5_a
You didn't even come close to
finding me last time. How are you
doing it so easily now?
Man
840178_4_a
Come on, haven't you had enough
yet?
Yuuki
840178_3_a
Yuuki

bg_event_japan_castle
Dammit...
Man
840178_1_a
Stubborn one, aren't you?
Yuuki
840177_23_a
Grrr, I'm not gonna lose again!
Man
840177_22_a
Hahaha, oh right!
Yuuki
840177_21_a
Because it's a necessary condition
for hiding in this spot. Duh!
Man
840177_20_a
But you don't need to worry about
breathing in VR, so why were you
using that reed?
Yuuki
840177_19_a
Nice trick with that water jutsu.
Yuuki
840177_18_a
Y-You little
Man
840177_17_a
Hahaha, found you!
Yuuki
840177_16_a
Wh-What the hell are you doing,
stabbing your sword into the
water like that?!
Man
840177_15_a
Gaaah!
Man
840177_14_a
Take THIS!
Yuuki
840177_13_a
...
Yuuki
840177_12_a
Hehehe...
Yuuki
840177_11_a
Hey, there's a twig sticking up
out of the surface of that pond
in the courtyard over there...
Yuuki
840177_10_a
bg_event_japan_castle
...
Yuuki
840177_9_a
Hehe, but I'll find him again...
Yuuki
840177_8_a
Grrrr! He's fast, I'll give him
that...
Yuuki
840177_7_a
Hey! How dare you run away again!
Yuuki
840177_6_a
Dammit!
Man
840177_5_a
What?! How did you know this was
a trick wall?!
Man
840177_4_a
Hyaaaaa!
Yuuki
840177_3_a
Gotcha!
Yuuki
840177_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle_inside
...
Yuuki
840177_1_a
Hehe, alright. See ya!
Man
840175_21_a
No, that's all fine by me.
So let's do this!
Yuuki
840175_20_a
Any complaints?
Man
840175_19_a
Oh, and it goes without saying
that you're the one who has to
withdraw if you don't find me.
Man
840175_18_a
Honest. But you're never gonna
catch me in a million years.
Man
840175_17_a
Honest?
Yuuki
840175_16_a
We can set up another duel, and
this time I'll withdraw properly.
Man
840175_15_a
I'll admit defeat if you can
find and catch me.
Man
840175_14_a
I'm sorry?
Yuuki
840175_13_a
Tch...! Okay, fine. But I have
one condition.
Man
840175_12_a
So you're just gonna
keep running away.
Yuuki
840175_11_a
I'm not gonna stick around and let
you whale on me like last time.
Man
840175_10_a
Heh, but I'm not that stupid.
Man
840175_9_a
Sh-Shut up! You want to fight
again?
Man
840175_8_a
Same to you! Didn't you run away
during our duel?
Yuuki
840175_7_a
Wh-What are you still doing here?!
Man
840175_6_a
Huh?
It's YOU!
Yuuki
840175_5_a
What the
???
840175_4_a
Then I can sneak up behind it
and hit its weak spot!
Yuuki
840175_3_a
Throwing this pebble close to that
mob should make it look the other
way...
Yuuki
840175_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle_inside
Alright...
Yuuki
840175_1_a
Hahaha, sorry.
Asuna
840173_21_a
But enough with the "assassin"
stuff! It makes me sound so
deranged!
Yuuki
840173_20_a
Absolutely!
Yuuki
840173_19_a
Hehe, true. So, want to stay here
and practicing assassinating
more mobs?
Asuna
840173_18_a
to be able to get through
whatever might come your way.
Yuuki
840173_17_a
I always knew that, but this just
reminded me how many different
combat styles you need to master
Yuuki
840173_16_a
Dueling face-to-face isn't
the only way to fight, after all.
Yuuki
840173_15_a
Wow... Well, you are an Imp, so
maybe you were always meant
to fight like this.
Asuna
840173_14_a
All the hidden doors and secret
passageways and stuff make it
pretty fun to play here.
Yuuki
840173_13_a
Plus, if there's one too strong
for me to handle, I can just hide
and let them pass me by.
Yuuki
840173_12_a
Surprise attacks like that one are
a total cinch for me now. The mobs
don't stand a chance!
Yuuki
840173_11_a
Yep. Once I started studying the
layout, I couldn't stop. It's
actually really interesting.
Yuuki
840173_10_a
You know this castle like the back
of your hand now, huh?
Asuna
840173_9_a
Hehe, more like a badass ninja!
Yuuki
840173_8_a
That was amazing! You're like some
medieval assassin!
Asuna
840173_7_a
Yes! I did it!
Yuuki
840173_6_a
Gwah!
Mob
840173_5_a
Hyaaaaa!
Yuuki
840173_4_a
Now!
Yuuki
840173_3_a
Asuna
840173_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle_inside
I just have to hold onto this
beam and wait for my chance...
Yuuki
840173_1_a
I guess you're right...
Yuuki
840171_27_a
And skills are more important in
ALO, anyway.
Asuna
840171_26_a
Yeah. It does kind of take the fun
out of VR if all you do is focus
on leveling up.
Asuna
840171_25_a
Grrrr, I should have studied the
castle layout more!
Yuuki
840171_24_a
Being unfamiliar with the area can
really cost you if you're not careful.
Asuna
840171_23_a
I suppose knowing the territory
does count for something...
Asuna
840171_22_a
That bothers me more than
anything else...
Yuuki
840171_21_a
I was definitely stronger, but he
knew the ins and outs of that
place way better than I did.
Yuuki
840171_20_a
No, I don't think so...
Yuuki
840171_19_a
Ugh, and you would have won, too!
How dumb!
Asuna
840171_18_a
Eventually time ran out and the
duel ended in a draw...
Yuuki
840171_17_a
I looked all over, but that place
has a million different hiding
spots, so I couldn't find him.
Yuuki
840171_16_a
That guy knew there was no way he
could beat me, so he just ran off
into the castle and hid.
Yuuki
840171_15_a
Yeah. It was at this dueling event
at the new area with the castle.
Yuuki
840171_14_a
Yuuki
840171_13_a
bg_21_alne
That actually happened?
Asuna
840171_12_a
You jerk! You can't just run away
in the middle of a duel! Get back
here!
Yuuki
840171_11_a
H-He ran away!
Yuuki
840171_10_a
What?!
Yuuki
840171_9_a
Huh...?
Yuuki
840171_8_a
Shut up!
Try THIS on for size!
Man
840171_7_a
Well?
Yuuki
840171_6_a
You can withdraw if you want.
I won't attack you anymore.
Yuuki
840171_5_a
Dammit... No one told me I'd be
facing off against Zekken...
Man
840171_4_a
How'd you like that? I think
it's safe to say I'm winning.
Yuuki
840171_3_a
Yuuki
840171_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle_inside
Hng...!
Man
840171_1_a
I've got your back!
Liz
840158_17_a
If anything like that happens,
I promise I'll come to you.
Silica
840158_16_a
Hehe, thank you, Liz.
Silica
840158_15_a
No way am I letting them get
within a hundred miles of my most
important protegee!
Liz
840158_14_a
I'll introduce their face to my
hardest hammer!
Liz
840158_13_a
Oh, and you tell me right away if
there's ever another creep that
starts bothering you.
Liz
840158_12_a
Hehe, I will!
Silica
840158_11_a
I'm still getting my chocolate
ready, but look forward to it
next time I see you!
Liz
840158_10_a
I'm honored.
Liz
840158_9_a
Awww, Silica... Thank you.
Liz
840158_8_a
Of course it's for you! You're one
of the people most important to
me, after all.
Silica
840158_7_a
Chocolate? For me...?
Liz
840158_6_a
item_event_valentine
That said...
Here.
Silica
840158_5_a
Hehe, right... Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.
Liz
840158_4_a
Only the people most important
to me get any.
Silica
840158_3_a
Liz
840158_2_a
bg_21_alne
So ever since then, I'm really
careful about who I choose
to give chocolate.
Silica
840158_1_a
That's a really grown-up way of
thinking about it...
Liz
840157_17_a
But after that came my highest
high, so I think it turned out
okay in the end, hehe...
Silica
840157_16_a
Everyone has their highs and lows,
and that Valentine's was the
lowest low for me...
Silica
840157_15_a
And then I got to meet you
and everyone else too.
Silica
840157_14_a
He helped give you hope again.
Liz
840157_13_a
Ahh... So he didn't just save
Pina...
Liz
840157_12_a
And that's when I met Kirito...
Silica
840157_11_a
Then Pina got killed... It was the
lowest I'd ever been...
Silica
840157_10_a
After that, I just couldn't trust
anyone...
Silica
840157_9_a
I take it back, he's not a creep.
He's total SCUM! I'm glad they
locked him up!
Liz
840157_8_a
Eventually he got locked up in the
Blackiron Palace for trying to
force himself on me...
Silica
840157_7_a
But he just wouldn't take no for
an answer. He wouldn't listen...
Silica
840157_6_a
Every time he brought it up,
I'd refuse...
Silica
840157_5_a
Well? So then what happened?!
Liz
840157_4_a
Hahaha... I knew you'd say
something like that...
Silica
840157_3_a
Silica
840157_2_a
bg_21_alne
Eewww, gross!
What a creep!
Liz
840157_1_a
...
Silica
840155_23_a
We can talk about it again later,
my darling Silica...
Man B
840155_22_a
Hehe, I guess I sprung this on you
a little too soon...
Man B
840155_21_a
Ah...
Silica
840155_20_a
Heeey! Come on, you two!
We're about ready to leave!
Woman
840155_19_a
H-Hold on! I don't feel the same
way. That's not what that
chocolate meant...!
Silica
840155_18_a
Let's forget about clearing the
game! We can just leave the party
and go live our lives together!
Man B
840155_17_a
Th-That doesn't matter! I mean,
there are plenty of other couples!
Man B
840155_16_a
B-But this is just a VRMMO...
Silica
840155_15_a
I mean be my girlfriend!
Man B
840155_14_a
G-Go out with you? Wh-What do
you mean?
Silica
840155_13_a
R-Really? Th-Then would you
go out with me?
Man B
840155_12_a
H-Huh? W-Well, yes, I mean
as friends...
Silica
840155_11_a
So then you like me too?
Man B
840155_10_a
Well... Yes, I think so...
Silica
840155_9_a
D-Does that mean y-you already
understand how I feel...?
Man B
840155_8_a
You don't need to thank me every
time you see me.
Silica
840155_7_a
I-I did?
Man B
840155_6_a
O-Oh, ha ha, but you already
thanked me.
Silica
840155_5_a
Thank you...for that chocolate...
Man B
840155_4_a
Y-Yes? What is it?
Silica
840155_3_a
Silica
840155_2_a
bg_04_field_bridge
Silica...
Man B
840155_1_a
...?
Silica
840153_21_a
Ah... N-Never mind...
Man B
840153_20_a
Yes?
Silica
840153_19_a
Silica... I...
Man B
840153_18_a
Yay!
Silica
840153_17_a
This chocolate looks great!
I'm eating it right now!
Man A
840153_16_a
Wow, Silica, thank you!
Woman
840153_15_a
bg_04_inn_restaurant
Thank you all so much for
everything... I hope you like it!
Silica
840153_14_a
Silica
840153_13_a
...
Liz
840153_12_a
But something happened after
I gave them the chocolate...
Silica
840153_11_a
I didn't have a lot of Col back
then, so I couldn't buy anything
fancy...
Silica
840153_10_a
I made them all chocolate for
Valentine's Day to show how much I
appreciated their kindness.
Silica
840153_9_a
They taught me how to survive in
that world. They cheered me up
when I was sad...
Silica
840153_8_a
Yes. I was the youngest one, so
they were always looking after
me...
Silica
840153_7_a
You did?
Liz
840153_6_a
We all got along really well. And
I trusted them with my life...
Silica
840153_5_a
Back then, I was one of about ten
people in this party...
Silica
840153_4_a
That first February...
Silica
840153_3_a
Liz
840153_2_a
bg_21_alne
It had only been three or four
months since SAO started...
Silica
840153_1_a
Huh...?
Liz
840151_27_a
I just remembered something
awful about Valentine's Day in
SAO...
Silica
840151_26_a
Huh? Silica, what's wrong...?
Liz
840151_25_a
I-I just...
Silica
840151_24_a
Maybe it's because you were so
social in SAO. Being so popular
must have made things difficult.
Liz
840151_23_a
Well, yes...
Silica
840151_22_a
I'm talking about how you treat
all your friends the same for
Valentine's like it's no big deal!
Liz
840151_21_a
What are you talking about?
Silica
840151_20_a
Not...mundane and platonic.
Liz
840151_19_a
Aw, come on... Valentine's Day
should be special and romantic!
Liz
840151_18_a
Y-You meanie!
Silica
840151_17_a
I'm not telling!
Liz
840151_16_a
D-Do you? S-So what are you going
to do about it!
Silica
840151_15_a
Ahahaha, your face is bright red!
Don't get so worked up over it!
I already know who!
Liz
840151_14_a
Well, that's... I don't...
Silica
840151_13_a
S-Special...?
Silica
840151_12_a
Hehe, I wonder who's going to be
your special Valentine this year!
Liz
840151_11_a
Even to people I only know here
in VR...
Silica
840151_10_a
Well... I'm going to give it to
all my close friends.
Silica
840151_9_a
So, who are you giving chocolate
to?
Liz
840151_8_a
O-Oh... Yes, of course...
Silica
840151_7_a
Don't be silly! Valentine's Day,
duh!
Liz
840151_6_a
Um... What time is that...?
Silica
840151_5_a
It's THAT time of year, riiight?
Liz
840151_4_a
What is it, Liz?
Silica
840151_3_a
Silica

bg_21_alne
Silica! Heeey, Silica!

あ、ありがとうございます!
シリカ

じゃあ道中気をつけるんだヨ
サクヤちゃんには
一言声をかけておくカラ
アリシャ
840148_24_a
すぐに追いかけます!
シリカ
840148_23_a
は、はい!
リズさん次はシルフ領に行くって
言ってました!
シリカ
840148_22_a
でもどうしても気になるなら、
すぐにリズを追いかけて
ちゃんと言えばいいんじゃないカナ?
アリシャ
840148_21_a
ふふっ、大丈夫だヨ
リズは気にしてないと思うヨ
アリシャ
840148_20_a
髪飾りまでもらったのに……
シリカ
840148_19_a
あたし……リズさんに対して、少し
恩着せがましくしてたような……
シリカ
840148_18_a
まああの子はその辺のことを
わざわざ言わなそうだからネ
アリシャ
840148_17_a
あたしには
お店を手伝ってほしいって
だけ言って……
シリカ
840148_16_a
えっ……?
そんな……
リズさんそんな事、一言も……
シリカ
840148_15_a
うまくやれてるか気になってた
んじゃないかナ……
アリシャ
840148_14_a
リズはきっとそんなシリカが
自分の見てない場所でも
アリシャ
840148_13_a
以前辛い想いをしたことが
あるって言ってたでデショ?
アリシャ
840148_12_a
シリカは人付き合いが得意だけど、
人当たりが良すぎるせいで、
アリシャ
840148_11_a
えっ……ええっ!?
シリカ
840148_10_a
これはただの想像だけど……
リズはシリカの様子を
見に来たんじゃないかナ?
アリシャ
840148_9_a
アリシャさん、どうかしました?
シリカ
840148_8_a
………………
アリシャ
840148_7_a
他の領地じゃなく
いきなりここで始めたのって、
なにかワケがあったのかなあって……
シリカ
840148_6_a
リズさんのお店ってALO中で
人気ですからね
シリカ
840148_5_a
でも一つ気になってたのが、
どうしてケットシー領でいきなり
出張店舗を始めたかなんですよ……
シリカ
840148_4_a
それは良かったネ
アリシャ
840148_3_a
アリシャ

おーい!
この武器を売りたいんだけど、
いいかな?
ケットシー
840147_16_a
は、はい!
シリカ
840147_15_a
ふふっ、うん
あたしにも手伝えるクエストだったら
なんなりと声かけてね
840147_14_a
この髪飾りに合う着物装備も
絶対ゲットしてみせますね!
シリカ
840147_13_a
リズさん……
ありがとうございます!
あたし嬉しいです!
シリカ
840147_12_a
余った素材を使って頭部防具の
それは作ることができたのよ
840147_11_a
さすがに着物装備を手に入れるのは
ちょっと時間がなかったけど、
840147_10_a
昨日あなた正月用の装備が
欲しいって言ってたでしょ?
840147_9_a
わあ……!
すごく綺麗……!
シリカ
840147_8_a
髪飾りなの
ほら、和服とかに合わせて
髪に付けるやつよ
840147_7_a
えっ……?
なんですかこれ……?
シリカ
840147_6_a
そう……
じゃあお礼代わりになるか
わからないけど……
840147_5_a
リズさんのお手伝いできるのは
すごく嬉しいですし、それに店番も
とっても楽しいですから!
シリカ
840147_4_a
あっ、ううん
全然気にしてないですよ

bg_event_field
シリカ、二日連続で
手伝ってもらっちゃって
ごめんなさいね
840147_1_a
シリカ……
840145_14_a
ちょっと探してみようかなって
思ってたところだったんですよね……
シリカ
840145_13_a
今ALOでお正月の着物とか、
可愛い新装備がたくさん実装されてる
じゃないですか?
シリカ
840145_12_a
そ、そんなことはないですけど……
シリカ
840145_11_a
もしかしてあたし……
無理やり手伝わさせちゃってる?
840145_10_a
そのつもりだけど……
シリカ、なんか予定あった?
840145_9_a
えっ……明日もやるんですか?
シリカ
840145_8_a
明日もジャンジャン買い取って
もらって構わないからね
840145_7_a
でも良い品を回収できたわ
こっから売れる物に変えてく自信も
あるから、心配しないで
840145_6_a
大繁盛でしたね
まあでも……売りに来る
お客さんの方が多かったですけど
シリカ
840145_5_a
ふーっ、ようやく

でもシリカが手伝ってくれたおかげで
ホント助かってるわ
ありがとね
840143_31_a
ふふっ、そうかしら?
840143_30_a
ま、まあリズさんがそう言うなら……
でもリズさん、
相変わらずサバサバな性格ですね
シリカ
840143_29_a
細かいことはいいのー!
急に思い立ったのよ
840143_28_a
道中襲われそうになることも
なかったと思うんですけど……
シリカ
840143_27_a
そ、それは知ってますけど……
でも正式に手順踏んでくれば、
領主から通行証も渡されますし、
シリカ
840143_26_a
突発的に始めてやれちゃうのも
仮想世界の楽しみでしょ?
現実ならこうはいかないから……
840143_25_a
……?
シリカ
840143_24_a
まあ……それはいいじゃないの
840143_23_a
でもケットシー領で
出張店舗をするだなんて、
もっと早く教えてくださいよ
シリカ
840143_22_a
シリカ
840143_21_a
なんかあったら
あたしにすぐ声かけてね
840143_20_a
……ふふっ
ちょっと焦っちゃいました
シリカ
840143_19_a
毎度～!
840143_18_a
それではお支払いは
こちらになります
シリカ
840143_17_a
そ、そう
ここがそのお店だったのね
それならいいけど……
ケットシーB
840143_16_a
リズベット武具店って……
あの有名なお店!?
ケットシーB
840143_15_a
あたしがちゃあんと教育してるんで、
ご安心くださいな!
840143_14_a
今あたしの出張店舗の手助けを
してもらってる最中なんですよ
840143_13_a

お客様! その子は
このレプラコーン・リズベットの
無二の親友なんです!
840143_11_a
え、ええと……
シリカ
840143_10_a
……価格はそれでいいんだけど、
あなたケットシーでしょ?
武器のことなんてわかるの?
ケットシーB
840143_9_a
ではこの価格でいかがでしょう?
シリカ
840143_8_a
ねえねえ、
この武器売りたいんだけど?

リズベット武具店を
よろしくお願いしますね

そうか、
じゃあこいつを頼むよ

古い防具を回収してくれるってのは、
ここかい?
ケットシーA
840143_1_a
ふふふっ、それはねぇ～
840141_23_a
なんだか大変なんですね
で、あたしは
何をすればいいんですか?
シリカ
840141_22_a
廃棄された武器を回収して
素材に戻したりと、
やることは盛りだくさんなのよー
840141_21_a
もう一度使えそうな武器を買い取って
打ち直して使えるようにしたり、
840141_20_a
そうそう、ノリとしては近いかな
売られていく武器の中には、
掘り出し物もあったりしてね
840141_19_a
お店でも在庫処分とか
セールとかやってますし
シリカ
840141_18_a
ああ、確かに現実だと、
大掃除とか整理整頓とかしますよね
シリカ
840141_17_a
古い物を捨てたり、
新しい武器防具を新調したり、
そういう事する人が増えるのよ
840141_16_a
ふふっ、あんまり知られてないのよ
でもね、そこら辺は現実と同じでね
840141_15_a
書き入れ時……?
年末年始が繁忙期ってことですか?
聞いたことないですけど……
シリカ
840141_14_a
今って実はレプラコーンの
書き入れ時でね
その手伝いをしてもらおうかと……
840141_13_a
あたしにできることなら
やりますけどなんですか?
シリカ
840141_12_a
近くまで素材集めに来てたから、
メッセするより早いかなと思って、
ここまで来ちゃったの
840141_11_a
ちょっとシリカに
急ぎ頼みたいことがあって……
840141_10_a
で、どうしたんですか?
シリカ
840141_9_a
はいはい、わかってるわよ
840141_8_a
気をつけてくださいね
シリカ
840141_7_a
ほ、他の種族の領地の中心に
連絡なしで来るのは
なにかと勘違いされやすいですよ……
シリカ
840141_6_a
道中何度か襲われかけたし……
840141_5_a
いやー、ホントよね
我ながらちょっと
危なっかしかったわ
840141_4_a
リズさん……どうしたんですか?
ケットシー領まで
わざわざ来るなんて……
シリカ

シリカ
840141_2_a

あっ、シリカ～!

840138_33_a
もーっ、パパ!
わたしは幽霊でもお化けでも
ありませんよー!
840138_32_a
えっ、ええっ!?
840138_31_a
もしかしてその繋がり……?
キリト
840138_30_a
白い幽霊が出るって噂があって、
それで様子を探りに来たんだった!
キリト
840138_29_a
うーん……
あっ、そう言えば昔ここでユイを
見つけたとき……
キリト
840138_28_a
はい、確かに
840138_27_a
元々アストラル系なんて
出る場所じゃなかっただろ、
ここって……?
キリト
840138_26_a
それにしても……なんでこの森で
幽霊モンスターなんか出たんだ?
キリト
840138_25_a
そうですね……
840138_24_a
俺はせめて
近くで見守っていられたらって……
そう思うんだ
キリト
840138_23_a
でもあいつは……
必死に乗り越えようと
してるんだよな
キリト
840138_22_a
あの頃のことを思い出すのは……
SAOサバイバーなら
誰しも仕方のないことだ
キリト
840138_21_a
ああ……
普段は元気にしてるが、
ふとしたときに
キリト
840138_20_a
フィリアさん
楽しそうで良かったですね
840138_19_a
………………
キリト
840138_18_a
じゃあまたねー!
フィリア
840138_17_a
はい!
840138_16_a
うん、ユイちゃんもありがとう
アスナによろしくね
フィリア
840138_15_a
フィリアさん、さようなら
840138_14_a
あはは、確かにー
フィリア
840138_13_a
霊炎の揺らぎを消去されたら、
たまったもんじゃないからな
キリト
840138_12_a
仮に誰かにやられて
デスペナでも受けて
キリト
840138_11_a
でもまあ夜道で
襲われないようには気をつけるよ
ありがとね
フィリア
840138_10_a
はは、そうだな
キリト
840138_9_a
あはは、
その辺SAOの仕様で考える癖が
残ってるんじゃないの、キリト
フィリア
840138_8_a
そうか
気をつけて帰れよ……
ってのもおかしな話だけど
キリト
840138_7_a
あっ……
あたしは今日はもうログアウトするよ
だいぶ遅い時間になっちゃったしね
フィリア
840138_6_a
よし、じゃあ戻るか
キリト
840138_5_a
うん!
これがあれば探索のときに、
すごく助かるよ
フィリア
840138_4_a
フィリア
840138_3_a
キリト
840138_2_a
item_event_torch
bg_16_forest_night
無事に《霊炎の揺らぎ》を
手に入れましたね
840138_1_a
ううん、でも……ありがとう
キリト……
フィリア
840137_23_a
そうか……そうだよな
すまん、俺が考えすぎだったよ
キリト
840137_22_a
あたしはきっと……
あの頃よりも強くなれてるはずだから
大丈夫なんだ……
フィリア
840137_21_a
それに……
確かにあの頃を思い出して
少し怖くなることはあっても……
フィリア
840137_20_a
もーっ、心配性だなぁ
名前にホロウが付いてるくらいじゃ、
そんな風にならないよ
フィリア
840137_19_a
ええっ?
い、いや……
そういうわけじゃ……
キリト
840137_18_a
動けなくなったりでも
するとか思った?
フィリア
840137_17_a
もしかしてあたしが、
ホロウ・エリアにいたときの
トラウマでも急に思い出して、
フィリア
840137_16_a
あーっ、キリト
すごく安堵した顔してる!
フィリア
840137_15_a
ふぅ……
キリト
840137_14_a
やった!
倒したよー!
フィリア
840137_13_a
ブアアアッ!!
ホロウ・アニマ
840137_12_a
その顔なら大丈夫そうだな……
よし、戦闘開始だ!
キリト
840137_11_a
うん、任せて!
フィリア
840137_10_a
フィリアは後ろに回り込んで、
聖属性の強烈なやつを頼むぜ!
キリト
840137_9_a
わかった……!
じゃあ正面のタゲ取りは俺がやる!
キリト
840137_8_a
うん、だから平気だって!
むしろ名前を聞いてなきゃ、
ただの幽霊モンスターだからね!
フィリア
840137_7_a
フィリア、大丈夫か!
キリト
840137_6_a
……!
フィリア
840137_5_a
ボアアアアッ……
ホロウ・アニマ
840137_4_a
キリト
840137_3_a
フィリア
840137_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
いましたよ!
あれがホロウ・アニマです!
840137_1_a
………………
キリト
840135_25_a
さあ、じゃあ
そのホロウ・アニマを探して、
出発だよ!
フィリア
840135_24_a
せっかくの希少素材を
ゲットしたいしね!
あたしは全然問題ないって
フィリア
840135_23_a
ううん、平気平気!
フィリア
840135_22_a
大丈夫か?
もし気分が乗らないなら、
ここで止めても別に俺は構わないぞ
キリト
840135_21_a
あたしとしたことが
思わずうろたえちゃったよ
ごめんごめん
フィリア
840135_20_a
ええと……うん
そ、そうだよね……あはは
フィリア
840135_19_a
それ以上の意味はないと思う
気にする必要はないんじゃないか?
キリト
840135_18_a
ホロウは《うつろな》、
アニマは《霊魂》だ
キリト
840135_17_a
えっ……あっ
フィリア
840135_16_a
フィリア……
もしかして名前を気にしてるのか?
キリト
840135_15_a
フィリアさん、どうかしましたか?
840135_14_a
基本的な
アストラル系モンスターと同様、
聖属性の攻撃に弱く……
840135_13_a
……!
フィリア
840135_12_a
今回の幽霊型モンスターの名前は
《ホロウ・アニマ》
840135_11_a
ユイちゃん、ターゲットの詳細を
教えてもらってもいいかな?
フィリア
840135_10_a
そうだな
夜も遅いし、
さっさとクリアしちゃおうぜ
キリト
840135_9_a
この人数でもなんとかなるよね、
きっと
フィリア
840135_8_a
見た感じ、
あまり大がかりな
クエストじゃなさそうだし、
フィリア
840135_7_a
まあ……いたとしても、
来なかった気はするけどな、はは
キリト
840135_6_a
ああ、そうなんだ
フィリア
840135_5_a
ママは今ユウキさんを
見送りに行っていました
840135_4_a
キリト
840135_3_a
840135_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
結局アスナは来なかったんだね
フィリア
840135_1_a
フィリア
840133_18_a
でも念のため出かけるって
声だけかけとくよ
ちょっと行ってくる
キリト
840133_17_a
ふふっ、そうだね
フィリア
840133_16_a
いや、やっぱ止めとこう
あいつあんまりアストラル系
得意じゃないから……
キリト
840133_15_a
ああ、いいぜ
アスナもまだログアウトしてないし
誘って……
キリト
840133_14_a
キリト、
パーティ直後で申し訳ないけど、
ちょっと手伝ってもらえない?
フィリア
840133_13_a
まさにトレジャーハンター御用達の
素材ですね
840133_12_a
加えて明かりの範囲も、
かなり広いって評判なのよ!
フィリア
840133_11_a
一度ダンジョンに入ってから
出るまで全く火が消えないの
フィリア
840133_10_a
松明を作るための素材なんだけど、
それで作った松明は
フィリア
840133_9_a
聞いたことないな……
どんな効果があるんだ?
キリト
840133_8_a
おおっ!
そのアイテムあたし欲しかったのよ!
フィリア
840133_7_a
それを倒せば、
希少アイテム《霊炎の揺らぎ》という
素材が手に入ります
840133_6_a
この周辺の針葉樹林エリアに、
アストラル系のモンスターが
登場したそうです
840133_5_a
どんな内容なんだ?
キリト
840133_4_a
フィリア
840133_3_a
キリト
840133_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
はい、レアリティの高い
スペシャルクエストのようですね
840133_1_a
ええっ?
こんなタイミングで?
フィリア
840131_26_a
今この付近で突然クエストが
発生したみたいです!
840131_25_a
ユイ、突然どうしたんだ?
キリト
840131_24_a
パパ!
フィリアさん!
840131_23_a
うん……
あんまり思い出したくないかな
フィリア
840131_22_a
そういうフィリアこそ、
SAO時代のクリスマスなんて、
とても楽しむ余裕はなかったろ?
キリト
840131_21_a
そっか……
フィリア
840131_20_a
色々あって落ち込んでた時期
だったよ……
キリト
840131_19_a
次の年のクリスマスは……
ちょっと酷いことになってたな
キリト
840131_18_a
ニヤニヤとか口に出すなよ
キリト
840131_17_a
やっぱそうなんだねぇ～
ニヤニヤ
フィリア
840131_16_a
一年目は4層でアスナと一緒に
キャンペーンクエストやってたな
キリト
840131_15_a
一年目はまだ虜われてから
そんなに時間が経ってなかった
けど……
フィリア
840131_14_a
やっぱアスナと一緒に過ごしてたの?
フィリア
840131_13_a
うん、そうだね
そう言えばキリトはSAOにいたとき
クリスマスはどうしてたの?
フィリア
840131_12_a
みんな現状の不安を
少しでも忘れてしまいたい……
そんな感じで騒いでただけだからな
キリト
840131_11_a
確かにな……あのデスゲームの最中も
お祭りとかちょっとした打ち上げとか
何度かあったけど……
キリト
840131_10_a
ちょっと夢みたいだよ
フィリア
840131_9_a
はあ……それにしても、
この世界でこんな風にクリスマスを
お祝いできる日が来るなんて……
フィリア
840131_8_a
そうか
キリト
840131_7_a
ふふ、ストレアが欲しがって
一緒にクエストやってたから、
ついでにあたしの分もね
フィリア
840131_6_a
そう言えばフィリアも
SAOアバターとサンタ衣装を
手に入れてたんだな
キリト
840131_5_a
うんうん
フィリア
840131_4_a
ああ、そうだな
仮想世界でのクリスマスパーティも
いいもんだな
キリト
840131_3_a
キリト
840131_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
ふぃ～、楽しかった
フィリア
840131_1_a
はい、アリシャさんも!
シリカ
840128_24_a
じゃあ二人とも……
良いクリスマスを……
アリシャ
840128_23_a
え、ええ、そうね
シノン
840128_22_a
ああ、そうでした
早く行きましょう、シノンさん!
シリカ
840128_21_a
さあ、ここはもういいから、
二人は早くキリト君たちのトコへ
行きなヨ
アリシャ
840128_20_a
とにかく今日は助かったヨ
アリシャ
840128_19_a
まったく……調子いいんだから
シノン
840128_18_a
にゃはは、それは考えすぎだヨ～
アリシャ
840128_17_a
それって私たちがまるで、
騒ぎ事のエサにされたみたい
じゃない!?
シノン
840128_16_a
ん? ちょっと待ちなさい
シノン
840128_15_a
なるほど……
シノン
840128_14_a
傍目からは二人だけを連れて、
少数で巡回してる振りを見せつけ
なきゃダメだったってわけだヨ
アリシャ
840128_13_a
問題の根元を絶つわけじゃないからネ
だから今回、
アリシャ
840128_12_a
そうするとどうせ
あたし達が立ち去った後で、
また騒ぎ始めるだけなんだヨ
アリシャ
840128_11_a
ノンノン……それは違うヨ
アリシャ
840128_10_a
えと……でもそれならそれで、
未然に防ぐことになるんじゃない
でしょうか?
シリカ
840128_9_a
それにこっちが最初から大部隊で
大名行列みたいにしてたら、
トラブルだって発生しないヨ
アリシャ
840128_8_a
確かに……そうだったわね
シノン
840128_7_a
竜騎士隊はケットシーの最終兵器……
普段は秘匿しなきゃダメですもんね
シリカ
840128_6_a
にゃはは
まあまあ、そうヘソを曲げなイ
可愛い顔が台無しだヨ?
アリシャ
840128_5_a
……なによ
竜騎士隊を控えさせていたなら、
最初から言いなさいよ
シノン
840128_4_a
シリカ
840128_3_a
シノン
840128_2_a
bg_event_alo_cait_sith_palace
いや～今日は二人とも助かったヨ
無事にトラブルも未然に解決できたし
領内の治安も守れたヨ
アリシャ
840128_1_a
ぎ、ギャアアアアッーーー!!
サラマンダー
840127_35_a
それはさすがに見苦しいナ～
アリシャ
840127_34_a
ななっ!?
ま、待ってくれ!
お、俺たちが悪かった!!
サラマンダー
840127_33_a
竜騎士隊!
ただちに降下し、アリシャ様に接近
するサラマンダー達を駆逐せよ!!
竜騎士隊
840127_32_a
じゃ、さよーなら
サラマンダーのプレイヤーさん
アリシャ
840127_31_a
う、うげぇぇぇっ!?
な、な、なんだ!?
頭上のこの竜の群れは!?
サラマンダー
840127_30_a
グロアアアアアッ!!!
???
840127_29_a
ん、なんだ……急に空が暗く……?
雪でも降るのか……?
サラマンダー
840127_28_a
な、なんだと……!?
サラマンダー
840127_27_a
キミたちは倒すどころか、
このあたしに触ることすらできず……
デスペナを受けることになるんだヨ
アリシャ
840127_26_a
そんな人数でこのアリシャ様を
仕留められるわけないんだヨ?
大きな誤算だって言ってるノ
アリシャ
840127_25_a
なに!?
サラマンダー
840127_24_a
はぁ……
ケットシー領主も
甘く見られたもんだネ
アリシャ
840127_23_a
アリシャ
840127_22_a
領主殺しの名声は俺のもんだぜー!
サラマンダー
840127_21_a
シノン
840127_20_a
は、早くアリシャさんを連れて
戻りましょう!
シリカ
840127_19_a
シリカ
840127_18_a
サラマンダー……!
まだ潜んでいたのね……!
う、迂闊だったわ!
シノン
840127_17_a
アリシャ
840127_16_a
やっちまえ、やっちまえーー!!
サラマンダー
840127_15_a
アリシャ
840127_14_a
へへっ、まさか領主自らが
こんなところまで出張ってるなんて、
俺らついてるぜ～!!
サラマンダー
840127_13_a
シリカ
840127_12_a
くっ……!!
シノン
840127_11_a
なっ……!?
シノン
840127_10_a
えっ!?
シリカ
840127_9_a
アリシャさーん、
もう片付きましたよぉ……
シリカ
840127_8_a
教科書どおりの捨て台詞なんて
吐くから悪いのよ
……さて
シノン
840127_7_a
シノンさん……手厳しいですね
あはは……
シリカ
840127_6_a
残念だけど、あんた達の顔なんて
すぐに忘れちゃうわ……
シノン
840127_5_a
シリカ
840127_4_a
こんなすぐに戦いが
終わっちゃうようじゃ、
シノン
840127_3_a
お、覚えてやがれ～!!
サラマンダー
840127_2_a
bg_event_field
くそっ……なんだこのケットシー!?
メチャクチャつぇぇ……!
サラマンダー
840127_1_a
ウン、二人とも頼んだヨ!
アリシャ
840125_21_a
そうですね……じゃあ行ってきます!
シリカ
840125_20_a
避けたいのは事実だヨ
アリシャ
840125_19_a
あはは、まあそれはないとしても、
種族全体がペナルティを
もらっちゃうからネ
アリシャ
840125_18_a
その言い方だと
まるで二度と生き返らないみたい
じゃない
シノン
840125_17_a
ケットシー領主が
サラマンダーによって、
討たれる……なんてネ
アリシャ
840125_16_a
師走の仮想世界全体が
盛り上がるこの時期……
アリシャ
840125_15_a
あはは……
確かに年末のALOで一番の
ニュースになっちゃいそうだネ
アリシャ
840125_14_a
そうですよ
領主に万が一のことがあると
大変ですからね
シリカ
840125_13_a
えっ、デモ……
アリシャ
840125_12_a
あれくらいならシリカと私で十分だわ
アリシャは戦闘に参加せず、
ここで見ていて
シノン
840125_11_a
はい!
シリカ
840125_10_a
二人とも、助太刀頼めるかナ?
アリシャ
840125_9_a
この時期に血の気が多くなるのは、
やっぱりどの種族も
変わらないんだネ～
アリシャ
840125_8_a
はァ……
アリシャ
840125_7_a
シリカ
840125_6_a
アリシャ
840125_5_a
あそこ見て!
ケットシーのプレイヤーが
サラマンダーに追われてるわ!
シノン
840125_4_a
今だ、追い込め!!
サラマンダー
840125_3_a
サラマンダー
840125_2_a
bg_event_field
た、助けてくれ～!!
ケットシー
840125_1_a
もちろんダヨ
この時期は色んなトコで揉め事が
起きてるからネ～
アリシャ
840123_26_a
圏外でも巡回する必要があるのね
シノン
840123_25_a
そんなことないヨ
これから圏外に出るからネ
アリシャ
840123_24_a
あはは……あたし達の護衛なんて、
要らないんじゃないでしょうか……?
シリカ
840123_23_a
すごい効き目……
まさに鶴の一声って感じね……
シノン
840123_22_a
ハイ!
失礼しました～!
プレイヤー
840123_21_a
ウンウン、わかればいいんだヨ～!
アリシャ
840123_20_a
もう二度としません～!
プレイヤー
840123_19_a
げげっ!?
は、はい、わかりました!
プレイヤー
840123_18_a
これ以上トラブルになりそうなら、
ケットシー領山奥の竜の巣に
突き落とすヨ!
アリシャ
840123_17_a
二人とも言い訳しなイ!
騒がしくしなイ!
アリシャ
840123_16_a
な、なんだと～!
プレイヤー
840123_15_a
でもこいつが
俺のことをバカにしやがって!
プレイヤー
840123_14_a
あっ、アリシャ様……!
プレイヤー
840123_13_a
ほらっ!
そこの二人!
今すぐ大声で喚くの止めるんだヨ!
アリシャ
840123_12_a
一杯やってるのか、それとも年末の
無礼講で白熱しちゃったのカ……
どちらにしても放置できないネ
アリシャ
840123_11_a
は、はい
そうだったと思います……
シリカ
840123_10_a
あの二人って確か
同じギルドの友達同士よね
シノン
840123_9_a
うーん、早速やってるネ……
アリシャ
840123_8_a
巡回を始めた途端なのに……
シノン
840123_7_a
前から思ってたんだ!
お前のバトルスタイルが
気に入らないってな!
プレイヤー
840123_6_a
おう言ってやる!
プレイヤー
840123_5_a
シリカ
840123_4_a
シノン
840123_3_a
アリシャ
840123_2_a
bg_18_mountain
オイ!
それはどういうことだ!?
もっぺん言ってみやがれ!
プレイヤー
840123_1_a
ウン、もちろんだヨ～!
アリシャ
840121_28_a
それをこれから検討するから、
まずは巡回のプランを
教えてくれるかしら?
シノン
840121_27_a
手伝ってくれるノ!?
アリシャ
840121_26_a
ええ、私もそれを考えていたわ
アリシャ、詳細を教えてくれる?
シノン
840121_25_a
シノンさん、時間の許す限り、
アリシャさんのお手伝いが
できないでしょうか?
シリカ
840121_24_a
確かに必要よね……
領内のトラブルを未然に防ぐ
って意味でも……
シノン
840121_23_a
にゃはは、そうそう
アリシャ
840121_22_a
あはは……その状況って、
もはや現実とあんまり
変わらないですよね
シリカ
840121_21_a
つまり領内の巡回ってことね
シノン
840121_20_a
クリスマスシーズンに年末忘年会……
みんな盛り上がるのはいいけど、
羽目を外すことも少なくないからネ～
アリシャ
840121_19_a
この時期はVRMMO内でも、
なにかとトラブルが
起きやすいでショ?
アリシャ
840121_18_a
ウン!
アリシャ
840121_17_a
護衛……
アリシャさんどこかに
出かけるんですか?
シリカ
840121_16_a
そっかァ……
じゃあ護衛を頼もうって思って
たんだけど、無理かナァ……?

シノン

そ、そうですね
あたし達クリスマスパーティの準備が
ありますし……
シリカ
840121_5_a

まあ領主からの指示だし従うけど、
なるべく早く済ませたいわね
シノン

840121_1_a
I-I told you not to remember!
Asuna
840118_18_a
Walking around outside... I feel
like I've almost got it...
Kirito
840118_17_a
I wish I could wipe that memory
from my brain!
Asuna
840118_16_a
It was horrible, walking around
outside like this with a boy
I barely knew...
Asuna
840118_15_a
Cut it out!
Asuna
840118_14_a
Hmmm... But now you've got me
even more curious...
Kirito
840118_13_a
Ah! No no no, don't you go
remembering!
Asuna
840118_12_a
Right at the start, was it?
Kirito
840118_11_a
It's embarrassing! I mean, it was
right at the start when we were
trapped in SAO...
Asuna
840118_10_a
What is there to be embarrassed
about?
Kirito
840118_9_a
Embarrassing? But...we're married,
aren't we?
Kirito
840118_8_a
No way, no WAY!
It's embarrassing!
Asuna
840118_7_a
Wha-?! Come on! You can't say you
remembered and then not tell me!
Kirito
840118_6_a
I-I'm not telling!
Don't try to force it out of me!
Asuna
840118_5_a
So, when was it that I saw you
wearing that?
Kirito
840118_4_a
Y-Yeah...
Asuna
840118_3_a
Asuna
840118_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Asuna? Did you remember?
Kirito
840118_1_a
Nyehehe, roger that!
Argo
840117_17_a
Alright, we better hurry up
and find this burglar before
Her Majesty gets any more upset.
Kirito
840117_16_a
Sh-Shut up!!!
Asuna
840117_15_a
Nyahaha! Asu, yer face has
been gettin' redder 'n' redder!
I can't stop laughin'!
Argo
840117_14_a
Stealth?! I have NEVER been so
embarrassed in my LIFE! This calls
for an all-out charge!
Asuna
840117_13_a
Yeah, yer right. We gotta go
'bout this nice 'n' stealthy.
Argo
840117_12_a
Plus, we're in the safe zone,
so we don't have to worry
about fighting.
Kirito
840117_11_a
I don't think it'll be too hard
since all we have to do is catch
the cat burglar.
Kirito
840117_10_a
Come on, you two...
We have to finish this quest
in the equipment we have on.
Kirito
840117_9_a
A-Argo! Don't be so base!
Asuna
840117_8_a
Woncha be cold, walkin' around
the village like that at night?
Argo
840117_7_a
Nyahaha, ya sure do like ta sleep
unimpaired, doncha, Asu?
Argo
840117_6_a
Wh-What are we going to do?!
I don't want to stay like this
forever!
Asuna
840117_5_a
So they must have been stolen
when we weren't paying attention.
Kirito
840117_4_a
Well, there wasn't any scene of
our clothes being stolen...
Kirito
840117_3_a
Kirito
840117_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
S-So... That thief stole all our
clothes?!
Asuna
840117_1_a
Me too... Don't tell me...
Kirito
840115_27_a
I got the same message as Asu...
Argo
840115_26_a
Wha...!
Argo
840115_25_a
Lemme try changin'...
Argo
840115_24_a
What?!
Kirito
840115_23_a
I CAN'T change! I just got a
message that says I can't change
out of this equipment!
Asuna
840115_22_a
So...you decided not to change
after all?
Kirito
840115_21_a
What is it, Asuna?! You almost
gave me a heart attack...
Kirito
840115_20_a
W-W-WHAT?!
Asuna
840115_19_a
No idea...
Kirito
840115_18_a
Same as ours, then. So, what'd
this burglar steal?
Argo
840115_17_a
Yeah. Mine says,
'Apprehend the cat burglar
targeting travelers.'
Kirito
840115_16_a
That means ya must've triggered
a quest too, eh, Kii-boy?
Argo
840115_15_a
You can change after we've talked
about this...
Kirito
840115_14_a
Uwaaaah! H-Hold on, I'm changing!
Asuna
840115_13_a
Nyahaha, Asu was just about ta
fall asleep!
Argo
840115_12_a
I know-ahh! Asuna, what were you
doing?
Kirito
840115_11_a
Kirito, we've triggered a quest!
Asuna
840115_10_a
Yeah, I can hear you! I'm coming
over right now!
Kirito
840115_9_a
Asu, I just heard Kii-boy.
I'm sure he heard you!
Argo
840115_8_a
Ah, the inn's doors are
soundproof, aren't they?
Asuna
840115_7_a
Asuna?!
Kirito
840115_6_a
Kirito! Kirito!
Asuna
840115_5_a
A quest?! But I was dead asleep!
Kirito
840115_4_a
What's this all of a sudden...?
Kirito
840115_3_a
Huh...?
Kirito
840115_2_a
bg_04_inn_bed
...
Kirito
840115_1_a
Nyehehe, yer as red as a lobster,
Kii-boy!
Argo
840113_26_a
I-I know that!
Kirito
840113_25_a
I'm serious, Kirito. Absolutely
NO peeking into our room!
Asuna
840113_24_a
I-I think I'll be just fine!
Kirito
840113_23_a
If ya get lonely all by yerself,
I'll come keep ya company!
Argo
840113_22_a
Good night, Kirito.
Asuna
840113_21_a
Got it. Get some rest, you two.
Kirito
840113_20_a
So Argo and I are in this room,
and you're in that one, Kirito.
Asuna
840113_19_a
Hahaha, that's true...
Asuna
840113_18_a
it's crazy to think we can get
this exhausted.
Kirito
840113_17_a
Even though we aren't really using
our bodies inside a VRMMO,
Kirito
840113_16_a
sigh
Finally, break time!
Argo
840113_15_a
Thank you very much.
Asuna
840113_14_a
Argo
840113_13_a
Asuna
840113_12_a
bg_04_inn_bed
These are your rooms.
Enjoy your stay.
NPC
840113_11_a
According to the map, we're
almost there, Argo. We just have
to hold on for a bit longer!
Asuna
840113_10_a
Yeah, yeah, I get it, Kii-boy.
I'll just keep walkin' like a good
lil' info broker.
Argo
840113_9_a
Or would you rather make camp
in these monster-infested woods?
Kirito
840113_8_a
Well, the town we're going to
rest in is just a little further
down the road.
Kirito
840113_7_a
I'm sooo bored, I need somethin'
ta do!
Argo
840113_6_a
What's with you all of a sudden,
Argo? You don't have to answer
or anything, Asuna.
Kirito
840113_5_a
J-Juicy...?
Asuna
840113_4_a
Kirito
840113_3_a
Asuna
840113_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Kii-booooy, Asuuuu...
Tell me somethin' juicy!
Argo
840113_1_a
Huh? Did you remember something?
Kirito
840111_20_a
Ah...!
Asuna
840111_19_a
When would you have seen me
wearing it...?
Asuna
840111_18_a
I got it in the early days of SAO.
It's one of my favorite pieces of
equipment...
Asuna
840111_17_a
Y-Yeah...
Kirito
840111_16_a
What?! Y-You mean this camisole?
Asuna
840111_15_a
I feel like I've seen you in
those clothes before, but
I can't place where...
Kirito
840111_14_a
Hm?
Asuna
840111_13_a
Th-That's not it.
Kirito
840111_12_a
I'm not sure what to say...
Asuna
840111_11_a
Y-Yeah, you know, greeting the
dawn like this together does
feel kind of weird...
Asuna
840111_10_a
Uhhh...
Kirito
840111_9_a
What is it?
Asuna
840111_8_a
Oh, uh... Um...
Kirito
840111_7_a
H-Hey, Kirito... You're staring
at me. It's kind of making me
embarrassed...
Asuna
840111_6_a
...
Kirito
840111_5_a
Is something wrong, Kirito?
Asuna
840111_4_a
...
Kirito
840111_3_a
Good morning, Kirito...
Asuna
840111_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Morning, Asuna.
Kirito
840111_1_a
はい、ありがとうございます……!
あたし、過去の自分に勝てて、
本当に良かったって思ってます!
シリカ
840078_25_a
うん、きっとそうだよ!
リーファ
840078_24_a
いや、俺もようやく納得いったぜ
その想いの強さがシリカを過去の
自分自身と対峙させてくれたのかもな
キリト
840078_23_a
あ、あはは、
ちょっと非現実的ですかね?
シリカ
840078_22_a
シリカ……
リーファ
840078_21_a
そう強く願っていたから
じゃないかって思うんです
シリカ
840078_20_a
あの頃よりも強くなれたことを、
自分自身が証明したかったから……
シリカ
840078_19_a
あたしがあの時ちょうど
アインクラッドのことを
考えていたから……
シリカ
840078_18_a
あの……
あたしの妄想なのかも
しれないんですけど……
シリカ
840078_17_a
うーん、なんなんだろうな……
キリト
840078_16_a
へぇ……
戦えた人とそうじゃなかった人の差って
どこにあるんだろうね?
リーファ
840078_15_a
い、いや……俺は霧の中を
さ迷ってるだけだった
キリト
840078_14_a
お兄ちゃんも自分の姿と戦ったの?
リーファ
840078_13_a
ALOとSAOは基幹システムが一緒だ
過去のゲームデータを参考にすることも
可能なはずだし
キリト
840078_12_a
普通のプレイヤーだとSAOの姿には
ならないんだろうけど、シリカは
特別だったってことなんだろうな
キリト
840078_11_a
まさかSAO時代のアバターが
登場するとは思いませんでしたけど……
シリカ
840078_10_a
今回のクエストのテーマだった
みたいですね
シリカ
840078_9_a
はい!
過去の自分と向き合うっていうのが、
シリカ
840078_8_a
わあっ、すごい!
その装備ってあのエリアで手に入る
限定装備だよね?
リーファ
840078_7_a
item_event_armor2
そしてストレージにこの装備が……
シリカ
840078_6_a
何とか勝てたと思ったら、霧も晴れて
元の場所に戻ってて
キリトさんとも再会できたんです
シリカ
840078_5_a
シリカ
840078_4_a
キリト
840078_3_a
シリカ
840078_2_a
bg_21_alne
それで自分自身と戦ったの?
リーファ
840078_1_a
きゅきゅい!
840077_31_a
あの二年間の戦いの日々を乗り越えて
強くなったってこと……
証明してみせます!
シリカ
840077_30_a
840077_29_a
わ、わかりました
戦って……勝ちます、あたし
シリカ
840077_28_a
………………
???（シリカ）
840077_27_a
840077_26_a
あなたと……戦えってこと?
シリカ
840077_25_a
ならそれをここで……
証明してみせて下さい……
???（シリカ）
840077_24_a
アインクラッドで過ごした日々が
無駄じゃないと言いました……
???（シリカ）
840077_23_a
840077_22_a
……!
しゃべった……!
シリカ
840077_21_a
あなたは……
???（シリカ）
840077_20_a
840077_19_a
じゃああなたは、あたしの過去の姿……
幻なの……?
シリカ
840077_18_a
ハッ!?
この世界樹の苗木で作られた花園は、
過去の幻を見せる力がある……
シリカ
840077_17_a
しかも……
その格好はSAO時代のもの……
一体どういう……
シリカ
840077_16_a
きゅきゅ?
840077_15_a
840077_14_a
あなたは……あたし?
シリカ
840077_13_a
………………
???（シリカ）
840077_12_a
840077_11_a
えっ!?
シリカ
840077_10_a
シルエットの大きさが
あたしくらいだし……
シリカ
840077_9_a
確かに……人影が……
でもキリトさんじゃないね……
シリカ
840077_8_a
きゅる!
840077_7_a
ん、ピナ……どうしたの?
あっちに誰かいるの?
シリカ
840077_6_a
きゅきゅ!
840077_5_a
はぁ……キリトさん……
どこに行っちゃったんだろ……?
さっきまであんなに近くにいたのに……
シリカ
840077_4_a
きゅーい!
840077_3_a
840077_2_a
bg_04_field_flower_fog
キリトさん!
キリトさぁん!!
シリカ
840077_1_a
キリトさん……一体どこに……?
シリカ
840075_22_a
えっ……!?
シリカ
840075_21_a
きゅい!?
840075_20_a
キリトさん!?
シリカ
840075_19_a
急に俺達の周囲を取り囲み始めた……?
これは……シリカ、離れるな!!
キリト
840075_18_a
わっ、いつの間に……!?
シリカ
840075_17_a
bg_04_field_flower_fog
えっ……なんだ、この霧は……?
キリト
840075_16_a
ピ、ピナ……どうしたの?
シリカ
840075_15_a
きゅいきゅい!
840075_14_a
シリカ……
キリト
840075_13_a
キリトさん……
シリカ
840075_12_a
ああ、それは俺も同じだよ……
キリト
840075_11_a
あの二年間で大事なことを
あたしは沢山学びましたから……
シリカ
840075_10_a
確かに亡くなってしまった人には、
とても失礼な言い方なのかも
しれないですけど……
シリカ
840075_9_a
多かったですけど……あの出来事が
無かったら良かったなんて……
思えません
シリカ
840075_8_a
そうですね……
あたし……あの世界で過ごして
最初は辛くて悲しいことも
シリカ
840075_7_a
ああ、色々なことがあったからな
俺もシリカも、そしてアインクラッドを
生き残ったSAOサバイバー達も……
キリト
840075_6_a
随分と昔のことみたいですね……
そんなに時間が経った訳じゃない
のに……
シリカ
840075_5_a
あっ……
そ、そうですね……
シリカ
840075_4_a
840075_3_a
シリカ
840075_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
そう言えばここって……
SAOの思い出の丘に似てるかもな……
キリト
840075_1_a
はい、お願いします!
シリカ
840073_23_a
絶対に見つけような!
キリト
840073_22_a
新エリアだから
まだ見つかってないクエストも
多いはずだぜ
キリト
840073_21_a
はい……
シリカ
840073_20_a
さて、じゃあ探索を始めるか
ここで新しいクエストを
探すんだったよな
キリト
840073_19_a
きゅい～……
840073_18_a
ピ、ピナ……キリトさんが
近くまで来てたなら、
ちゃんと教えてよ～
シリカ
840073_17_a
そ、そうか……
キリト
840073_16_a
あっ、いえ、ハイ……
そ、その……ちょっと考えごとを
してたので……
シリカ
840073_15_a
なっ……ど、どうして驚くんだ?
待ち合わせだったろ……?
俺も時間どおりだったと思うんだが
キリト
840073_14_a
はわっ!?
き、キリトさん!
シリカ
840073_13_a
シリカ、お待たせ
キリト
840073_12_a
もう、ピナったら
さっきからどうしたの?
シリカ
840073_11_a
きゅいきゅい!
840073_10_a
ハッ!?
も、もしかしてこれって、
で、で、デー……
シリカ
840073_9_a
きゅい!
840073_8_a
キリトさんと待ち合わせるだけ
なのに……
シリカ
840073_7_a
あ、ありがとう……
はぁ……な、なんでこんなに、
ドキドキするんだろう……
シリカ
840073_6_a
きゅいきゅい!
840073_5_a
ピ、ピナ、あたしの格好、変じゃない?
寝癖とかないかな?
服、シワになってないかな?
シリカ
840073_4_a
きゅい?
840073_3_a
840073_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
はぁ……
シリカ
840073_1_a
ハイ!!
シリカ
840071_20_a
うん、じゃあ明日お兄ちゃんと
ここで待ち合わせってことで!
リーファ
840071_19_a
そ、それは……そうですね!
は、はい!
ぜひお願いします!
シリカ
840071_18_a
また装備を
手に入れる機会があるかもしれないよ
リーファ
840071_17_a
あのクエストは限定クエだった
みたいだけど、他のクエストが
見つかれば、
リーファ
840071_16_a
えと……えと……
シリカ
840071_15_a
お兄ちゃんには、
あたしから言っておくからさ!
リーファ
840071_14_a
あいにく明日あたしは
剣道の稽古があるんだ～
リーファ
840071_13_a
えっ……キリトさんと、ですか?
リ、リーファさんは……?
シリカ
840071_12_a
この辺で別のクエストがないか、
一緒に探索するってのは、どう?
リーファ
840071_11_a
明日お兄ちゃんが時間あるって
言ってたから、
リーファ
840071_10_a
……?
シリカ
840071_9_a
そっか……
あっ、そうだ!
リーファ
840071_8_a
あのクエストに関しては、
リーファさんの方が貢献度が高かったと
思いましたし、全然気にしてませんよ!
シリカ
840071_7_a
ええと……
まったく要らないかと聞かれたら
もちろん嘘になりますけど、
シリカ
840071_6_a
もらっちゃったでしょ?
ほんとはシリカも欲しかったのかなぁ
って思ってて……
リーファ
840071_5_a
この前のクエストで、クリア報酬の
装備が一つしかもらえなかったから
あたしが代表して
リーファ
840071_4_a
えっ、何のことですか、
リーファさん?
シリカ
840071_3_a
シリカ
840071_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
シリカちゃん、この前はごめんね
リーファ
840071_1_a
It sounds impossible when you put
it that way, but...I think it'd
be nice to have them as friends!
Silica
840068_18_a
Hehe, leave it to you to come up
with the idea of taming
witches, Silica.
Asuna
840068_17_a
Or maybe they can have them
fight on our side as allies!
Silica
840068_16_a
Maybe if we ask, the devs can do
something about that.
Leafa
840068_15_a
Hahaha, yeah, it'd be nice if they
didn't spawn on players who've
been through that quest.
Asuna
840068_14_a
Now we won't be able to fight them
next time they spawn either.
Leafa
840068_13_a
Me too!
But...
Leafa
840068_12_a
I'm just glad we didn't have to
fight that witch or her children!
Silica
840068_11_a
Yeah! I gotta hand it to the devs.
They still have some tricks up
their sleeves!
Leafa
840068_10_a
I bet any player who decides to
fight doesn't end up getting
the costume.
Asuna
840068_9_a
Still, your kindness saved the
day!
Asuna
840068_8_a
Hehe, but that second thing
wasn't on purpose. It was just
a happy accident.
Silica
840068_7_a
You figured out the Abracatabra
connection, and not fighting
is what landed us the costume!
Leafa
840068_6_a
It's all thanks to you we got it,
Silica.
Leafa
840068_5_a
Thank you so much for your
help, Asuna!
Silica
840068_4_a
Leafa
840068_3_a
Silica
840068_2_a
bg_18_tower
I'm so glad you two got the
witch costume!
Asuna
840068_1_a
Then take this clothing...
Witch
840067_29_a
What...?
Silica
840067_28_a
You...will leave us alone?
Witch
840067_27_a
...
Witch
840067_26_a
I know you want to give your
children candy, but it's probably
better if you stop stealing it...
Silica
840067_25_a
I'm sorry we disturbed you when
you were just trying to live
here in peace.
Silica
840067_24_a
Hmph!
Witch
840067_23_a
So you should hurry up and
get back to your children.
Silica
840067_22_a
Ms. Witch, we don't want to
fight you.
Silica
840067_21_a
...?
Witch
840067_20_a
Thank you...
Silica
840067_19_a
Not at all! I wanted to come along
and see what would happen anyway.
No apologies necessary.
Leafa
840067_18_a
I'm sorry, Leafa. You helped us
get this far, and now I'm
just quitting...
Silica
840067_17_a
I know... But now that I know
what's going on, I just can't
bring myself to fight her...
Silica
840067_16_a
If we don't defeat her, you might
not be able to get the witch
costume you want...
Asuna
840067_15_a
Silica... Are you sure?
Asuna
840067_14_a
We should stop here... I don't
want to fight her anymore...
Silica
840067_13_a
We were right...
Asuna... Leafa...
Silica
840067_12_a
to give to her kids!
Leafa
840067_11_a
So she was stealing candy from
that Halloween shop
Leafa
840067_10_a
Yeah, she definitely did!
Leafa
840067_9_a
Did she say "children"?!
Asuna
840067_8_a
I will not lose this time...
I must protect my children!
Witch
840067_7_a
You're...
You're the Halloween witch!
Asuna
840067_6_a
Tch... I can't believe you'd
pursue me all this way...
??? (Witch)
840067_5_a
Huh?!
Asuna
840067_4_a
W-Wait, don't go over there!
That's-!
Leafa
840067_3_a
Alright, let's go!
Asuna
840067_2_a
bg_event_halloween_castle
Asuna, Leafa, I found her!
Abracatabra's over there!
Silica
840067_1_a
Sure!
Leafa
840065_17_a
Leafa, can you tell me where this
Abracatabra appears?
Asuna
840065_16_a
It definitely warrants further
investigation.
Asuna
840065_15_a
A witch feeding her charge...
Makes sense...
Leafa
840065_14_a
Oh! Then that would explain why
her description changed!
Asuna
840065_13_a
Witches keep cats as pets, right?
What if the Halloween witch was
stealing candy for this little girl?
Silica
840065_12_a
Yeah, it's a cute play on words,
but-?
Asuna
840065_11_a
Asuna, Leafa...
It's AbraCATabra!
Silica
840065_10_a
Candy...
Silica
840065_9_a
What a weird description...
Asuna
840065_8_a
It says...she's feeling better
because of all the candy she's
been eating lately?
Asuna
840065_7_a
I feel like her flavor text has
changed since the last time I
read it...
Leafa
840065_6_a
Hard to hate an enemy like that...
She's one of those you don't have
to defeat so much as chase away.
Leafa
840065_5_a
Her name's Abracatabra...
She's a little girl!
Asuna
840065_4_a
Leafa
840065_3_a
Asuna
840065_2_a
bg_18_tower
What about her?
Silica
840065_1_a
This witch...
Leafa
840063_33_a
What is it, Leafa?
Asuna
840063_32_a
Hmm... Huh?
Leafa
840063_31_a
Hehe, they really are.
Asuna
840063_30_a
Wow! There are so many witches...
And they're all so cute!
Silica
840063_29_a
That'll give us something like
this.
Leafa
840063_28_a
I'll compile a list of all human
witch enemies in this window and
cross-check them... Then...
Leafa
840063_27_a
Okay, let me do it.
Let's see...
Leafa
840063_26_a
It could open up another lead.
Asuna
840063_25_a
I had a thought that maybe there's
one that LOOKS like the Halloween
witch or something...
Asuna
840063_24_a
Why list them up like that?
Silica
840063_23_a
You're right. How about we make a
list of all the witches that
exist here?
Asuna
840063_22_a
This is a fantasy game, after all.
Leafa
840063_21_a
Well, yeah. Witches are pretty
typical humanoid monsters.
Leafa
840063_20_a
Hey, Leafa, do you know of any
other witch mobs in ALO?
Asuna
840063_19_a
but they said no one's tried
to steal their candy since then...
Silica
840063_18_a
I even tried asking about it at
the Halloween candy shop,
Silica
840063_17_a
The quest text did say that it
seemed like the witch was still
alive...
Asuna
840063_16_a
But it is strange...
Asuna
840063_15_a
Haha, if that's the case, then
we've hit a dead end.
Asuna
840063_14_a
And if she isn't hurting anyone,
there's no reason to fight her...
Silica
840063_13_a
I see...
You could be right...
Silica
840063_12_a
I haven't heard of anything like
that since she was defeated,
so maybe she really is gone.
Leafa
840063_11_a
Well, she was controlling those
candy-stealing monsters, right?
Leafa
840063_10_a
What do you mean, Leafa?
Silica
840063_9_a
I wonder if the witch is even
still alive.
Leafa
840063_8_a
It seems like there hasn't been
a single player who's beaten this
quest yet.
Asuna
840063_7_a
Same here... I even tried
searching for it on the web.
Asuna
840063_6_a
I haven't had much luck either...
Silica
840063_5_a
Nooot really... The well of info
on this witch is dry as a bone.
Leafa
840063_4_a
Silica
840063_3_a
Leafa
840063_2_a
bg_18_tower
Has anyone found anything yet?
Asuna
840063_1_a
Okay!
Silica
840061_15_a
Alright, then let's try and find
out as much as we can for now.
Asuna
840061_14_a
That's right. Hopefully then
we'll get more clues for what
to do next.
Silica
840061_13_a
So I guess that means we're going
to have to defeat her again.
Leafa
840061_12_a
Well, that's our quest: to
discover what actually happened.
Silica
840061_11_a
But I thought she was killed!
Leafa
840061_10_a
According to the rumors I've
heard, that witch is still alive.
Silica
840061_9_a
There was a witch that was the
boss monster for one of the
earlier Halloween events.
Silica
840061_8_a
Okay. Here's what we need to do.
Silica
840061_7_a
Of course!
Asuna
840061_6_a
Ooh, ooh! Is it cool if I come?
I want that witch costume, too!
Leafa
840061_5_a
Okay!
Silica
840061_4_a
Now it's your turn! Let's go get
what you need for that witch
costume.
Asuna
840061_3_a
Silica
840061_2_a
bg_18_tower_top
Thank you for helping me get all
the materials I needed to make
the demon costume, Silica.
Asuna
840061_1_a
ははは、まあな
エギル
840058_19_a
相変わらず商売上手だねぇ
ジーマ
840058_18_a
いやいや、
お得意の顧客の話相手になるのも、
店主として当然の務めさ
エギル
840058_17_a
少し考えてみるよ、ありがとうエギル
ジーマ
840058_16_a
用心棒か……
うーん、釣りを最優先にしたいトコ
だけど
ジーマ
840058_15_a
用心棒でもやったら
儲かるんじゃないか?
エギル
840058_14_a
お前は探索も結構こなれてるし、
強さも申し分ない……
攻略組に入れとは言わないが……
エギル
840058_13_a
ふふっ、でも悪くないね
他人に褒めてもらうのもさ
ジーマ
840058_12_a
ほうほう……
あの子とあの子かな……?
ジーマ
840058_11_a
まあどっちも股聞き話だったが
エギル
840058_10_a
もう一つはダンジョンで
ストーカーっぽい嫌なプレイヤーから
助けてもらったって聞いたぜ
エギル
840058_9_a
ああ、最初の話は
川辺での採掘ポイントで良い場所を
色々教えてもらったって話だった
エギル
840058_8_a
えっ……?
あ、ああ前に言ってたやつ?
ジーマ
840058_7_a
……そう言えばジーマの評判、
何件か聞いたぜ
エギル

毎度あり
エギル
840058_5_a
あっ、うん
ジーマ
840058_4_a
そうか、そりゃ良かったぜ
今日もエサの購入か?
エギル

エギル、この前買ったあの針、
なかなか調子いいよ!

ありがとうございます!
シリカ

君のその子のエサ探しをして
街まで帰る……それでＯＫ?
ジーマ
840057_33_a
アタシは釣り場を探してるから
それが終わったら、
ジーマ
840057_32_a
そ、そうですね……
じゃあお願いします
シリカ
840057_31_a
……せっかくだし一緒に行動する?
その方が安心でしょ?
ジーマ
840057_30_a
は、はい……
シリカ
840057_29_a
ああいう変な男は
このゲームには結構いるから
あんたも気をつけた方がいいよ
ジーマ

あ、ありがとうございます
助かりました!

くっ……!
ぼ、ボクは君みたいな年増には
興味ないからな～～!!
男性プレイヤー
840057_24_a
アタシは今釣り場探しに忙しいんだ
二度は言わない
さっさとここから消えて
ジーマ
840057_23_a
ひ、ひいいっ!!!
男性プレイヤー
840057_22_a
はあっ!!
ジーマ
840057_21_a
な、何だよお前……
ボクはただ……!
男性プレイヤー
840057_20_a
さっきから聞いてれば、
キモイことばっかり言いやがって
ナンパならもっと上手にやりなよ
ジーマ
840057_19_a
うぎゃ!
男性プレイヤー

ぜりゃああっ!!
ジーマ

あっ!
シリカ

ちょっと痛めつけてやらないと、
わからないみたいだな!
男性プレイヤー
840057_15_a
何だこのコドモドラゴン……
さっきからうるさいなぁ……
男性プレイヤー
840057_14_a
きゅい!
840057_13_a
いや、だから違います!
は、離してください!
シリカ
840057_12_a
君みたいな幼くて
可憐な少女がこんな場所にいたら、
普通そう思うに決まってるって
男性プレイヤー
840057_11_a
そんなウソつかなくても、
ホントは怖くてビクビクしてたん
でしょ?
男性プレイヤー
840057_10_a
840057_9_a
だ、大丈夫です!
ここはこの子の好物を取る場所なので、
あたし何度も来てるんです!
シリカ
840057_8_a
……ん?
ジーマ
840057_7_a
お兄さんとパーティ組んだ方が
安心だよ?
???
840057_6_a
いいじゃないか、
このダンジョンは危険なんだよ
???
840057_5_a
きゅい!
???
840057_4_a
や、止めてください!
???
840057_3_a
うーん、どの辺かなぁ……?
ジーマ
840057_2_a
bg_12_bi_palace
このダンジョンの地下水脈のどこかに、
レアな淡水魚の生息地があるって
話だけど……
ジーマ
840057_1_a
こちらこそ
840055_21_a
アタシはジーマ
よろしく、リズ
ジーマ
840055_20_a
そっか
ならあなたに感謝しなきゃだね
あたしはリズベット、あなたは?
840055_19_a
あはは、それって多分アタシの事だよ
ジーマ
840055_18_a
ああ、そういえばアルゴも
この採掘ポイントは、釣り師の子から
聞いたんだゾって言ってたな～
840055_17_a
うん、そうだよ
ジーマ
840055_16_a
情報屋ってアルゴ?
840055_15_a
すぐ情報屋に伝えちゃったんだ
ジーマ
840055_14_a
アタシは釣り専門プレイヤーだから、
特に鉱物を独り占めしたいとかは
考えないから
ジーマ
840055_13_a
うん、元々こうして釣りをしてた時に、
偶然ポイントを見つけただけだしね
ジーマ
840055_12_a
えっ? そうなの?
840055_11_a
ああ、うん採れるよ
というかその採れるってことに
最初に気付いたの、アタシだと思うし
ジーマ
840055_10_a
この辺の水辺でレアな
砂金が採れるって聞いたの
何か知ってる?
840055_9_a
あ、うんいいよ
ジーマ
840055_8_a
釣りの最中に話しかけちゃって
ごめんなさい
ちょっといいかしら?
840055_7_a
あっ、こんちは
ジーマ
840055_6_a
こんにちは
840055_5_a
ちょっと高かったけど
買っといてよかった～
ジーマ
840055_4_a
それにキラキラしてるものに
寄って来るタイプの魚が、
ホントによく食いついてくれる!

ああ、任せとけ
エギル
840053_25_a
うん、頼んだよエギル
ジーマ
840053_24_a
うっ……
な、何か他人の評判を聞くのは
怖いけど……
ジーマ
840053_23_a
だがお前とパーティ組んだ奴らが
ありがたがってるのは、事実だと思うぜ
今度お前の評判を聞いといてやるよ
エギル
840053_22_a
何よ～
喜んで損した!
ジーマ
840053_21_a
すまん、こっちはオレの想像だ
エギル
840053_20_a
えっ、ホント!?
ジーマ
840053_19_a
旅路の途中とはいえ、一時的に
パーティに加わってくれるだけでも、
みんな助かるって言ってたぜ
エギル
840053_18_a
別に冗談のつもりはないさ
それにジーマはレベルもかなり高いしな
エギル
840053_17_a
……ふふっ
まあ冗談でもそう言ってくれて
嬉しい、かな?
ジーマ
840053_16_a
お前の第一目的はおいといて……
それは結果的には攻略への貢献にも
なってるんじゃないのか?
エギル
840053_15_a
釣り具用に手に入れた未確認素材が
新種の武器生成に繋がったこともある
エギル
840053_14_a
その探索がレアな素材を
手に入れられる場所の発見に繋がったり
エギル
840053_13_a
お前の目的は確かに釣りかもしれんが、
釣り場探しのために色々な場所の
探索をしてるだろ?
エギル
840053_12_a
だがジーマの場合は
ちょっと違うと思うぜ
エギル
840053_11_a
ちょ、アタシは真面目に……!
ジーマ
840053_10_a
はは、確かに遊んでるだけだな
エギル
840053_9_a
これってただ遊んでる
だけじゃないのかなって……
ジーマ
840053_8_a
毎日釣り場を探しては
釣って満足するだけ……
ジーマ
840053_7_a
さっきのエギルの話を聞いてて……
アタシってこのデスゲーム攻略に
貢献できてるのかなって……
ジーマ
840053_6_a
あっ、ええと……
ごめん
ジーマ
840053_5_a
おい、ジーマ……どうしたんだ?
ボーっとして

どうだ、ジーマ
エギル

ふぅん……
ジーマ
840051_22_a
それぞれ役割ってのがあるからな
オレはこうして奴らを支援することで、
オレの役目を全うできると思ってるんだ
エギル
840051_21_a
オレはそう信じてる
それに……
エギル
840051_20_a
そいつに任せておけば
必ずいつか攻略してくれる……
エギル
840051_19_a
それに攻略組の中には……
オレの信頼のおける奴らがいる
エギル
840051_18_a
時々って感じだな
こっちの方が板についてきたからな
エギル
840051_17_a
そうなんだ……
攻略組はもうそんな所に行ってるんだ
最近はエギルも参加してるの?
ジーマ

70層を超えて
攻略組の士気も上がってるからな
何かと商品の需要は絶えない状況だ
エギル

まあボチボチって感じだな

最近、どう?
店の調子は

心配すんなって
エギル

そうなの?
うん、見てく見てく

新しい釣り針が手に入ったんだが、

Q-Quit laughing at me!
Silica
840048_42_a
Haha, that's for sure!
Kirito
840048_41_a
Hahaha, you must be okay
if you've got this much energy!
Liz
840048_40_a
What?! Of course I won't, I didn't
mean it literally! Liz, you...
You big meanie!
Silica
840048_39_a
Just be careful not to trip, okay?
Liz
840048_38_a
Liz... Hehe, you're right.
I'm just going to take things
one step at a time!
Silica
840048_37_a
We just gotta keep putting one
foot in front of the other and
live our lives the way we want!
Liz
840048_36_a
After all, WE get to have
a good time here, too.
Liz
840048_35_a
No matter how anyone choses to
come after us, we still need
to play fair and square.
Liz
840048_34_a
Hard? Says who?
It's like we talked about
before we came here, Kirito.
Liz
840048_33_a
Yeah.
It can be hard to deal with...
Kirito
840048_32_a
But I just can't bring myself to
enjoy that way of doing things...
Silica
840048_31_a
I know they were just playing ALO
according to the PvP rules this
game encourages...
Silica
840048_30_a
No, I was just thinking...
Silica
840048_29_a
Silica... Something wrong?
Kirito
840048_28_a
...
Silica
840048_27_a
Oh. Well. Good.
Liz
840048_26_a
Hahaha. They ran away already...
Silica
840048_25_a
They'll think twice before messing
with my Silica again! Ooh, they're
gonna get so many death penalties!
Liz
840048_24_a
Anyway, where are those jerks? I'm
gonna teach them a lesson in
manners they'll never forget!
Liz
840048_23_a
Hehe, Liz, cut it out!
Silica
840048_22_a
Still, how could we NOT worry?!
Oooh, Silica...
I'm so glad you're safe!
Liz
840048_21_a
Oh, yes.
I managed okay...
Silica
840048_20_a
We were worried...for no reason,
it looks like.
Kirito
840048_19_a
Liz? Kirito?
What are you doing here?
Silica
840048_18_a
S-Silica!!
Liz
840048_17_a
...?
G-Got it, we're gone!
Salamander
840048_16_a
Who knows what fate might
befall you if you stay...
Silica
840048_15_a
Juuuust kidding!
Now go on, get out of here.
Silica
840048_14_a
What?
Salamander
840048_13_a
Hehe, I don't recall saying
I was letting you go free...
Silica
840048_12_a
I promise I'll never bother you
again... I can't take another
fight like this...
Salamander
840048_11_a
gulp
...
Mmmm, delicious!
Silica
840048_10_a
I did lose a little HP, though...
One moment, I need a potion.
Silica
840048_9_a
And all I had to do to counter
your fire attacks was let
Pina's bubbles put them out.
Silica
840048_8_a
You had numbers on your side,
but your attacks were easy
enough to avoid.
Silica
840048_7_a
Besides, I didn't do anything
even remotely "demon"-like.
Silica
840048_6_a
Well, that's not a very nice
thing to say...
Silica
840048_5_a
You...demon...
Salamander
840048_4_a
Hehe, good job back there, Pina.
Silica
840048_3_a
Chirp chiiirp!
Pina
840048_2_a
bg_17_forest
Phew...
Silica
840048_1_a
Yeah!
Liz
840047_19_a
I couldn't agree more.
Come on, we have to hurry!
Kirito
840047_18_a
He should grow up and fight her
fair and square!
Liz
840047_17_a
I guess...
But still, what a baby!
Liz
840047_16_a
Just because we're going to help
Silica doesn't absolve us from the
fact we're about to attack too.
Kirito
840047_15_a
That's not what I meant... Just,
they're only attacking a player
from an enemy race, right?
Kirito
840047_14_a
How can you say that?!
Whose side are you even on?!
Liz
840047_13_a
There's no debating that, but...
This is one way to play ALO...
Kirito
840047_12_a
Cowards...
Liz
840047_11_a
Yeah, it sounds like he got a
group of his buddies together
to go after her for revenge...
Liz
840047_10_a
One of the Salamanders attacking
her is the one from before, isn't
it? The one she beat to a pulp?
Kirito
840047_9_a
A-Apparently...
Liz
840047_8_a
Okay! But wait... Do you mean to
tell me that Silica's fighting them
by herself?!
Kirito
840047_7_a
They told me the place.
Come on!
Liz
840047_6_a
Wh-What?! Where?!
Kirito
840047_5_a
A group of Salamanders is
attacking Silica!
Liz
840047_4_a
The Cait Sith from before just
told me!
Liz
840047_3_a
Liz? Slow down. What is it?
Kirito
840047_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Kirito! We've got a situation!
Liz
840047_1_a
...
Silica
840045_22_a
RAAAAAAAUUUGGHHHH!
Salamander
840045_21_a
You'll pay for that!
Salamander
840045_20_a
What the-! What is this?
A bubble attack?!
That little pipsqueak!
Salamander
840045_19_a
CHIIIIIIRP!
Pina
840045_18_a
Do it, Pina!
Silica
840045_17_a
Then you know there's no point
fighting! Just take the death
penalty and let us kill you!
Salamander
840045_16_a
You have the advantage here since
ALO is set up to favor people of
the same race working together...
Silica
840045_15_a
Is that so?
Then you leave me no choice...
Silica
840045_14_a
Don't play dumb! You know this is
revenge for humiliating me before!
Salamander
840045_13_a
Wh-What do you want?
Silica
840045_12_a
Gehehe...
Salamander
840045_11_a
Bahaha, act tough all you want.
We all know you can't beat
this many on your own!
Salamander
840045_10_a
Chiiiiirp!
Pina
840045_9_a
Tch... An ambush, is it?
Silica
840045_8_a
Your weekly routine never changes.
You always go to the same places.
Salamander
840045_7_a
Hehe... I knew all I had to do
was wait here for you
to head back to town.
Salamander
840045_6_a
Wha-!
Silica
840045_5_a
yawn
...
I better log out and go to bed...
Silica
840045_4_a
This week's quest took a bit more
time to finish than I thought...
Silica
840045_3_a
Chiiirp...
Pina
840045_2_a
bg_17_forest
sigh
... It sure got late fast,
didn't it, Pina?
Silica
840045_1_a
Chiiiirp!
Pina
840043_23_a
O-Okay!
Silica
840043_22_a
You know, it's not too late for
that picnic. Asuna and the others
are waiting for us and everything!
Liz
840043_21_a
Liz, I...
Silica
840043_20_a
Hehe, I'm only teasing!
You know I trust you with my
life, Silica!
Liz
840043_19_a
Ehehe, I don't know about that...
Silica
840043_18_a
Hahaha, yeah, you're a seasoned
ALO veteran after all, Silica.
Kirito
840043_17_a
What a terrible impression!
My voice isn't that shrill! And
I'd never say anything like that!
Silica
840043_16_a
crying for her brave hero Kirito
to save her! "Oh, Kirito, help me,
you're my only hope!"
Liz
840043_15_a
And here I thought we'd get here
and find this damsel in distress,
Liz
840043_14_a
It means a lot to me that you
would come help. Thank you
so much!
Silica
840043_13_a
I'm just glad you and all the
other Cait Siths are safe.
Kirito
840043_12_a
Oh, well, I suppose I managed!
Silica
840043_11_a
We came as fast as we could...
But it looks like you swept the
floor with that jerk no problem!
Liz
840043_10_a
Liz! Kirito!
Silica
840043_9_a
Silica, are you okay?!
Kirito
840043_8_a
Silica!
Liz
840043_7_a
Chirp chiiirp!
Pina
840043_6_a
It's nothing. Cait Siths of a
feather stick together!
Silica
840043_5_a
Thank you so much, Silica!
You saved us from getting
a death penalty!
Cait Sith
840043_4_a
Tch...
You're stronger than I thought...
Don't think I'll forget this!
Salamander
840043_3_a
Salamander
840043_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Ready to give up yet?!
Silica
840043_1_a
Chirp!
Pina
840041_21_a
O-Okay!
Silica
840041_20_a
Right, our picnic's gonna have to
wait. I'll get Kirito and the
others. You go on ahead!
Liz
840041_19_a
Well, we've met before.
We've done some quests together...
Silica
840041_18_a
Is this a friend of yours...?
Liz
840041_17_a
It was terrible...
Cait Sith
840041_16_a
A... a Salamander attacked this
Cait Sith...
Silica
840041_15_a
Huh? What is it?
What happened?
Liz
840041_14_a
Heeeey, Silica!
There you are. I've been looking
all over for you! You're late!
Liz
840041_13_a
Th-That's awful!
Silica
840041_12_a
Salamanders! They attacked us!
Me and my friend...
They're still hurting my friend!
Cait Sith
840041_11_a
Wh-What's wrong?!
Silica
840041_10_a
Help! Somebody, please!
Cait Sith
840041_9_a
Well, let's go then...
Silica
840041_8_a
Chiiiirp...
Pina
840041_7_a
Oh, sorry... I mixed that up with
what happened with my cat
in real life...
Silica
840041_6_a
I told you, it's fine!
I promised I wouldn't feed you
canned food again, didn't I?
Silica
840041_5_a
Chirp chirp chiiiiirp!
Pina
840041_4_a
Don't worry, I made sure to pack
your favorite ore!
Silica
840041_3_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
840041_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Lunch boxes: check.
And that's everything!
We're all ready to go, Pina!
Silica
840041_1_a
Chirpity chirp chirp!
Pina
840038_19_a
You bet!
Silica
840038_18_a
Pina, you didn't even have to ask!
Let's be the best of best friends!
Leafa
840038_17_a
Hehehe! Pina wants to know if she
can be your friend too.
Silica
840038_16_a
Chirp!
Pina
840038_15_a
Of course!
Silica
840038_14_a
I'm happy that you're happy!
So...think we can be friends?
Leafa
840038_13_a
I'm really happy to hear that!
Leafa... Thank you!
Silica
840038_12_a
So I was hoping we'd hit it off if
we hung out together, and we
could become friends...
Leafa
840038_11_a
I had a gut feeling that you and
me had a lot in common.
Leafa
840038_10_a
Hehe... You got me.
Leafa
840038_9_a
Um, sorry if I'm wrong on this...
But thinking back on it, I just
got that vibe...
Silica
840038_8_a
Wha-?!
Leafa
840038_7_a
You were really just after an
excuse to tell me you thought
we were alike, weren't you?
Silica
840038_6_a
It wasn't just an excuse to talk
about Kirito, was it?
Silica
840038_5_a
When you came to talk to me the
other day and ended up helping
Pina and me look for Dragonite...
Silica
840038_4_a
What's up, Silica?
Leafa
840038_3_a
Leafa
840038_2_a
bg_21_alne
Umm... Leafa?
Silica
840038_1_a
Chirp chirp CHIRP!
Pina
840037_23_a
Yeah!
Thanks for helping us out, Leafa!
Silica
840037_22_a
We did it, Silica!
Nice work, Pina!
Leafa
840037_21_a
Woohoo!
Silica
840037_20_a
item_event_84003_ingot
It can't be! It is!
It's Dragonite! We found it!
Silica
840037_19_a
Look! Under that bush!
Something's shining!
Leafa
840037_18_a
Pina, what is it?
Silica
840037_17_a
Chirp!
Pina
840037_16_a
...
Silica
840037_15_a
I think we're more alike than you
think, Silica.
Leafa
840037_14_a
Leafa...
Silica
840037_13_a
A little girl in trouble, trapped,
trying desperately not to cry...
Leafa
840037_12_a
When he said you reminded him of
me, I think that's what he saw.
Leafa
840037_11_a
He knew that I was just faking it.
That I was really depressed...
Leafa
840037_10_a
I think... I think he saw through
my happy facade.
Leafa
840037_9_a
You didn't get along?
Silica
840037_8_a
It's not like we hated each
other or anything, but...
Leafa
840037_7_a
My brother and I get along now,
but it wasn't like that two
years ago.
Leafa
840037_6_a
But Suguha!
You and I are nothing alike!
Silica
840037_5_a
Yeah. I've been thinking about
what he said to you, and I don't
think he was lying.
Leafa
840037_4_a
You mean the real reason why
Kirito saved me?
Silica
840037_3_a
Silica
840037_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
Hey, Silica?
About what you said earlier...
Leafa
840037_1_a
Silica...
Leafa
840035_25_a
But he was probably way too
embarrassed to admit it, so he
came up with that excuse...
Silica
840035_24_a
It's because he's really
just a nice guy!
Silica
840035_23_a
So after I met you, I realized the
real reason Kirito saved me...
Silica
840035_22_a
H-Hey! Let's not go there!
Leafa
840035_21_a
You're so strong, and outgoing,
and...umm..."developed."
Silica
840035_20_a
After I met you, I realized...
we're nothing alike at all...
Silica
840035_19_a
Hehehe. It's silly, right?
Silica
840035_18_a
He said you reminded him of me...?
Leafa
840035_17_a
It's because you look like my
little sister.
Silica
840035_16_a
He said this...
Silica
840035_15_a
When I asked him why he went out
of his way to help me, a complete
stranger...
Silica
840035_14_a
...
Leafa
840035_13_a
But despite that, he always jumped
to the rescue of anyone in
trouble. Like me.
Silica
840035_12_a
He seemed really shy. Like he
didn't want to get too close to
anyone.
Silica
840035_11_a
But...
Silica
840035_10_a
W-Well, it's not like we spent
that much time together in SAO...
Silica
840035_9_a
I was kinda hoping you could fill
in the gaps a bit...
Leafa
840035_8_a
But he's never really talked
about his time in there...
Leafa
840035_7_a
Yeah...
He spent two years in SAO...
Leafa
840035_6_a
You mean...Kirito?
Silica
840035_5_a
What was my brother like in SAO?
Leafa
840035_4_a
Um, sure?
I don't mind. What is it?
Silica
840035_3_a
Silica
840035_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
So I know we're on a rock-hunt
right now, but can I change the
subject?
Leafa
840035_1_a
Hehe, sorry!
I couldn't help myself.
Leafa
840033_22_a
And even if it was, don't laugh at
your own jokes! That's just lame!
Silica
840033_21_a
Ugh, Leafa! Stop saying "rock
bottom" already! It's not funny.
Silica
840033_20_a
Ahahaha!
Leafa
840033_19_a
But it makes total sense!
Of course we hit "rock" bottom!
We're dealing with a rare here!
Leafa
840033_18_a
N-No, you're exaggerating...
Silica
840033_17_a
I've never seen anyone except you
with one here in ALO either!
It must be super-duper rare!
Leafa
840033_16_a
Whoa! Seriously?!
That's amazing!
Leafa
840033_15_a
Chirp...
Pina
840033_14_a
Huh...? Well...as far as I know...
Just me?
Silica
840033_13_a
How many people in SAO tamed a
Pina? I mean, a feathered dragon.
Leafa
840033_12_a
Unrelated, but I was wondering...
Leafa
840033_11_a
No... Sorry.
Silica
840033_10_a
Hmm... Just a picture, huh?
I guess it didn't have a name or
any other info that might help.
Leafa
840033_9_a
It looked exactly like the
Dragonite I knew back in SAO...
Silica
840033_8_a
I was looking through some
ALO forums and I found a
picture of it.
Silica
840033_7_a
Rats... Hey, where did you hear
about this Dragonite anyway?
Leafa
840033_6_a
Chirp...
Pina
840033_5_a
Umm... Nope. Not even a hint.
Silica
840033_4_a
Pina
840033_3_a
Silica
840033_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
Find anything?
Leafa
840033_1_a
R-Right!
Silica
840031_18_a
Of course! Come on! Let's go!
Leafa
840031_17_a
Y-You'll help me...?
Silica
840031_16_a
Ahh, I get it now. Alrighty!
Leafa's here to help! Let's
get looking!
Leafa
840031_15_a
Um... Well... That was what it was
called in SAO... I don't know if
it's the same here...
Silica
840031_14_a
You think...? Talk about vague...
You don't know for certain?
Leafa
840031_13_a
I think it's called Dragonite...
Silica
840031_12_a
Hehehe! Sorry, forget it!
Anyway, what sort of rock
are you looking for?
Leafa
840031_11_a
Gag? What do you-OH!
"Rock" bottom? N-No, that
wasn't intentional!
Silica
840031_10_a
Joke? Wait, you're serious?
That gag wasn't on purpose...?
Leafa
840031_9_a
A good...what?
Silica
840031_8_a
Ahahaha! That was a good one!
Leafa
840031_7_a
R-Right... Actually...I'm looking
for a stone for Pina, but I've had
zero luck. I've hit rock bottom...
Silica
840031_6_a
Ha ha ha!
But seriously, I'm here to help.
Leafa
840031_5_a
Everyone just converted over to
ALO, so you're all still noobs!
Let the great Leafa help ya out!
Leafa
840031_4_a
What's wrong?
You look down in the dumps!
Leafa
840031_3_a
Ah, Leafa?!
Silica
840031_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_meeting
SILICAAA!!
Leafa
840031_1_a
Okay!
Philia
840028_24_a
I don't doubt it!
Lead the way, Philia!
Kirito
840028_23_a
will find us every last bit of
loot that this dungeon is hiding!
Philia
840028_22_a
I, Philia,
treasure hunter extraordinaire,
Philia
840028_21_a
Hehe, this is exciting!
Leave it to me!
Philia
840028_20_a
We're counting on you, Philia.
Leafa
840028_19_a
That goes without saying!
Asuna
840028_18_a
Yeah, I'd be happy to,
if you'll have me.
Philia
840028_17_a
That's fantastic!
So you'll help us look around,
right?
Asuna
840028_16_a
Well, in any case, easier for me
than for you, Kirito.
Philia
840028_15_a
This dungeon is full of traps, but
she says it'll be a cinch for her.
Kirito
840028_14_a
But unlike me,
she's a treasure hunter.
Kirito
840028_13_a
Oh, just like you, Kirito.
Asuna
840028_12_a
So, Philia's a Spriggan!
Kirito
840028_11_a
Yeah, nice to meet you too.
Philia
840028_10_a
Nice to meet you, Philia.
Leafa
840028_9_a
And this is Leafa, my sister.
Kirito
840028_8_a
Thanks, Asuna...
Philia
840028_7_a
We were all really worried since
we hadn't heard from you.
It's so good to see you again!
Asuna
840028_6_a
Y-Yeah, Kirito told me...
Philia
840028_5_a
They aren't here right now, but
Liz, Silica, Klein, Agil, and the
others are all playing ALO too!
Asuna
840028_4_a
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!
SAO was ages ago!
Asuna
840028_3_a
Asuna...
Philia
840028_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
Philia!
Asuna
840028_1_a
A-Alright...
Philia
840027_31_a
Actually, Asuna's here, along with
someone else I'd like you to meet.
What do you say?
Kirito
840027_30_a
It'd be a big help.
Kirito
840027_29_a
I...
Philia
840027_28_a
Will you come with me?
Kirito
840027_27_a
Wha-?!
Sh-Shut up!
I'm getting out of here!
Philia
840027_26_a
Ha ha, I'm glad to see you're
finally back to your old self.
Kirito
840027_25_a
Hehehe.
Philia
840027_24_a
You've lost your touch if a
little trap like that caught
you unawares, Kirito.
Philia
840027_23_a
I'm a treasure hunter,
through and through.
Philia
840027_22_a
Hehe, yep.
Finally remembered, have you?
Philia
840027_21_a
Why did you choose to be a
Spriggan? Wait, don't answer
that...
Kirito
840027_20_a
Yeah.
Kirito
840027_19_a
Besides, this is the default color
for Spriggans. You're a
Spriggan too, right?
Philia
840027_18_a
Well, you guys not recognizing me
was part of it. But really, I just
wanted to change my look.
Philia
840027_17_a
And why you changed your hair
color.
Kirito
840027_16_a
So that's why you're not acting
like yourself.
Kirito
840027_15_a
O-Oh...
Kirito
840027_14_a
I knew without a doubt that you
would play this game.
Philia
840027_13_a
Heh, that was a lie, too.
Philia
840027_12_a
But there was the possibility that
we wouldn't have played ALO
in the first place, like you said.
Kirito
840027_11_a
Oh?
Kirito
840027_10_a
That's the reason why
I didn't try to find you.
Philia
840027_9_a
that I didn't see you anymore...
Philia
840027_8_a
So I thought,
maybe it was for the best
Philia
840027_7_a
I mean, I caused so much trouble
for you guys back in SAO...
Philia
840027_6_a
Philia...
Kirito
840027_5_a
I kind of lied earlier...
The truth is, I'd been putting off
finding you guys again...
Philia
840027_4_a
Huh?
Kirito
840027_3_a
Kirito
840027_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
I owe you an apology, Kirito...
Philia
840027_1_a
O-Oh, well...
That's good, then...
Kirito
840025_18_a
You have no idea how much
I wanted to see you and Asuna
and everyone else again!
Philia
840025_17_a
Huh?
No, of course not!
Philia
840025_16_a
You weren't...trying to avoid us,
were you?
Kirito
840025_15_a
N-Nothing...
Philia
840025_14_a
What's wrong, Philia?
Kirito
840025_13_a
Th-That's true...
Philia
840025_12_a
I never did meet you in real life,
unlike Liz or Silica...
Kirito
840025_11_a
Then again, I guess you wouldn't
have known how to contact me,
huh...?
Kirito
840025_10_a
But you should have gotten
in touch and told me you'd
converted over, Philia!
Kirito
840025_9_a
It's not like I TRY to get
caught up in this stuff!
It just happens!
Kirito
840025_8_a
Hehe, you're always right in the
thick of things no matter where
you go, aren't you?
Philia
840025_7_a
but I never would have thought
you were involved, Kirito!
Philia
840025_6_a
I had heard about something that
happened on top of the World Tree,
Philia
840025_5_a
I decided to stop using the avatar
I had converted over from SAO.
Kirito
840025_4_a
Yeah.
After I rescued Asuna,
Kirito
840025_3_a
Kirito
840025_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
So you're telling me that Sugo guy
kidnapped Asuna?
Philia
840025_1_a
Um, there's a lot to fill you in
on.
Kirito
840023_18_a
Mommy? Kirito, who is this
little girl?
Philia
840023_17_a
but then he had to save Mommy,
and after that, he had to remake
his avatar and start all over.
Yui
840023_16_a
Daddy did convert over and play
ALO for a little bit,
Yui
840023_15_a
Huh?
Philia
840023_14_a
Ha ha, I could say the same thing!
But it's not really accurate to say
I "converted."
Kirito
840023_13_a
I had no idea you'd converted
over to ALO...
Philia
840023_12_a
I...
Philia
840023_11_a
Is something wrong, Philia?
Kirito
840023_10_a
Y-Yeah...
Philia
840023_9_a
I knew it was you!
I haven't seen you in forever,
not since we beat SAO!
Kirito
840023_8_a
Huh?
Kirito?!
???
840023_7_a
Wait a second...
Don't tell me...
Is that you, Philia?!
Kirito
840023_6_a
...Hm?
???
840023_5_a
I can't believe they'd put a trap
trigger right on the walls...
Kirito
840023_4_a
Yeah, thanks to you.
Kirito
840023_3_a
Kirito
840023_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
That was close...
Are you all right?
???
840023_1_a
???
840021_24_a
Watch out!
???
840021_23_a
So if I just stick close to the
walls...
Kirito
840021_22_a
P-Perhaps...
Yui
840021_21_a
I feel like the most likely places
traps will be are intersections.
Kirito
840021_20_a
That said...
Kirito
840021_19_a
Yeah, you're right.
Kirito
840021_18_a
There's plenty of time to figure
things like that out, Daddy!
Yui
840021_17_a
Now that you've saved Mommy,
you can finally enjoy ALO to
the fullest.
Yui
840021_16_a
I guess I don't make a very
good Spriggan...
Kirito
840021_15_a
Th-That is true, but I can't since
I've got all my buffs and
battle skills maxed out...
Kirito
840021_14_a
As a Spriggan, you have excellent
vision in the dark. You should
make use of that ability!
Yui
840021_13_a
Don't be silly, Daddy!
Yui
840021_12_a
Evading traps is mostly a memory
game, so sometimes it doesn't
matter how careful you are.
Kirito
840021_11_a
Alright. But...
Kirito
840021_10_a
Traps can drain your HP and even
kill you, so please be very,
very careful.
Yui
840021_9_a
but Leafa is right.
There are lots of traps.
Yui
840021_8_a
Daddy, there may not be any super
strong monsters in this dungeon,
Yui
840021_7_a
Alright, let's go!
Kirito
840021_6_a
O-Okay!
Asuna
840021_5_a
Good idea.
Keep your eyes peeled for traps!
Leafa
840021_4_a
Asuna
840021_3_a
Leafa
840021_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
Alright, why don't we
split up and look?
Kirito
840021_1_a
Chirp!
Pina
840018_32_a
I'm just glad you and Pina are
okay!
Kirito
840018_31_a
Yeah! I really can't thank you
enough, Kirito! Thank you, thank
you, thank you!
Silica
840018_30_a
Ha ha, I guess not!
At least this ordeal has a
happy ending.
Kirito
840018_29_a
Chirrrrp chirp!
Pina
840018_28_a
And that means you're not gonna
scare me like that anymore, right?
Silica
840018_27_a
Hehehe, I guess that's true!
Silica
840018_26_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
840018_25_a
What's that?
You think so too, Pina?
Silica
840018_24_a
Chirrrp!
Pina
840018_23_a
For a tamed monster, she's reached
an incredible level, and she's
still growing.
Kirito
840018_22_a
And your bond with Pina is
strengthening. The fact that she
tried to save you is proof.
Kirito
840018_21_a
Pina's changing, huh?
Silica
840018_20_a
deep inside. And I feel like this
might just be the first step.
Kirito
840018_19_a
Pina's appearance didn't change,
but she was changing somewhere
Kirito
840018_18_a
Larva wrap themselves in cocoons,
and some animals shed their skin
as they grow.
Kirito
840018_17_a
Well, think about insects
and animals.
Kirito
840018_16_a
How so?
Silica
840018_15_a
was just the rest her body needed
to improve her abilities.
Kirito
840018_14_a
Maybe Pina's "illness"
Kirito
840018_13_a
so at this point, I feel like
anything is possible.
Kirito
840018_12_a
But you're the first person to
tame a creature like Pina,
Kirito
840018_11_a
Yeah, Pina has really leveled up.
Kirito
840018_10_a
But what was wrong with Pina
to begin with? How'd she recover?
I mean, she healed you!
Silica
840018_9_a
Phew.
That's a relief.
Kirito
840018_8_a
Chirp chirp chirp!
Pina
840018_7_a
Oh Pina! Thank goodness!
Silica
840018_6_a
Ahahaha! I think Pina's
finally back to normal!
Silica
840018_5_a
Chirp chirp!
Pina
840018_4_a
Silica
840018_3_a
Pina
840018_2_a
bg_04_forest_sunset
How are you doing, Pina?
Kirito
840018_1_a
Chirp!
Pina
840017_22_a
Yeah!
Silica
840017_21_a
You can follow me, right?
Kirito
840017_20_a
Plan's just changed again, Silica!
We're gonna punch through them!
Kirito
840017_19_a
This is just what we need!
Kirito
840017_18_a
Huh?! Pina's healing abilities
only ever work on me!
Silica
840017_17_a
Pina
840017_16_a
Silica
840017_15_a
Wh-What's happening?
How-?
How am I recovering HP?
Kirito
840017_14_a
Pina
840017_13_a
Silica
840017_12_a
Kirito
840017_11_a
Ch-Chirp!
Pina
840017_10_a
Huh?!
Silica
840017_9_a
Here we go, Pina!
Silica
840017_8_a
Go, now!
Kirito
840017_7_a
O-Okay!
Silica
840017_6_a
Sorry, Silica! Change of plans!
Let's head back to the central
district!
Kirito
840017_5_a
I think you might be right.
There are too many monsters!
Silica
840017_4_a
Urgh! Maybe fighting our way to
the next town wasn't the wisest
choice.
Kirito
840017_3_a
Kirito
840017_2_a
bg_04_field_bridge
Kirito, look!
Silica
840017_1_a
O-Okay!
Silica
840015_29_a
Stay sharp. I also heard that a
lot of powerful monsters spawn
along this road.
Kirito
840015_28_a
Got it.
Silica
840015_27_a
Let's head over to the next town.
I heard there are some beast
tamers there too.
Kirito
840015_26_a
O-Okay then...
Silica
840015_25_a
Huh?
Silica
840015_24_a
Nah, that's just wishful thinking.
Sorry, it's nothing. Never mind.
Kirito
840015_23_a
Oh, uh...
Kirito
840015_22_a
What's wrong, Kirito?
Silica
840015_21_a
Or maybe...
Kirito
840015_20_a
Hang on. If the AI can respond to
the bond between it and the
player...
Kirito
840015_19_a
Hahaha!
Kirito
840015_18_a
Yes, Pina, even when you don't
feel well, it shows!
Silica
840015_17_a
Chirp!
Pina
840015_16_a
You have an incredibly
special bond.
Kirito
840015_15_a
Your relationship has broken
through the barrier between
player and AI.
Kirito
840015_14_a
People were mostly shocked by
Pina's story.
Kirito
840015_13_a
I talked to a lot more people.
No one told me a story like yours.
Kirito
840015_12_a
So a tamed familiar tried to save
its owner. That makes your case
even more exceptional.
Kirito
840015_11_a
It looked like she was trying to
save me from the mob's attack.
Silica
840015_10_a
Hm? Oh, yes...
Yes, she did.
Silica
840015_9_a
Pina died trying to
protect you, right?
Kirito
840015_8_a
Well, I kept looking.
Kirito
840015_7_a
I see...
Kirito
840015_6_a
No.
Silica
840015_5_a
Any change in Pina's condition?
Kirito
840015_4_a
Silica
840015_3_a
Kirito
840015_2_a
bg_04_forest_sunset
Ch-Chirp...
Pina
840015_1_a
Yeah!
Kirito
840013_25_a
Uh, n-n-nothing! Let's, uh, get
back to searching for a cure!
Can you keep helping?
Silica
840013_24_a
Huh?
Kirito
840013_23_a
Are you still helping me because
I remind you of your little sis...?
Silica
840013_22_a
You don't need to thank me.
Kirito
840013_21_a
Thank you so much for helping me.
Not just this time, but back at
the Hill of Memories too.
Silica
840013_20_a
I know.
S-Sorry about that.
Silica
840013_19_a
Don't lose heart just yet, Silica.
We're not out of options yet.
Kirito
840013_18_a
Oh no...
Silica
840013_17_a
So we're already in uncharted
territory here.
Kirito
840013_16_a
a feathered dragon.
Kirito
840013_15_a
What's more, it seems like you're
the first person to actually tame
Kirito
840013_14_a
It turns out there aren't many
beast tamers out there.
Kirito
840013_13_a
So I took another look and found
something new.
Kirito
840013_12_a
N-No, it hasn't.
Silica
840013_11_a
Has Pina's condition changed?
Kirito
840013_10_a
Chirp...
Pina
840013_9_a
I see...
Kirito
840013_8_a
but she hadn't heard
of this illness either.
Silica
840013_7_a
The same thing happened to me.
I asked a friend of mine who's a
beast tamer,
Silica
840013_6_a
Th-That's okay.
Thank you for helping me.
Silica
840013_5_a
I've looked everywhere and talked
to all my connections, but I came
up empty-handed.
Kirito
840013_4_a
I'm sorry.
Kirito
840013_3_a
What is it, Kirito?
Silica
840013_2_a
bg_04_forest_sunset
Silica!
Kirito
840013_1_a
Y-Yes, of course!
Silica
840011_30_a
H-Hey, it'll be okay!
That's just ONE possibility!
At any rate, let's read quickly!
Kirito
840011_29_a
No! No no no!
Silica
840011_28_a
Suppose the revival item itself
caused a status affliction, and
if it goes untreated-
Kirito
840011_27_a
What do you mean?
Silica
840011_26_a
Which means we may not have the
luxury of reading every single
article related to Pina's illness.
Kirito
840011_25_a
That's right, it was a
limited-time item.
Kirito
840011_24_a
Yes, it was only around for a
short time, and you'd never hear
about it if you stuck to questing.
Silica
840011_23_a
about the item that
can revive familiars.
Kirito
840011_22_a
You're right. In fact, it doesn't
seem like many people even know
Kirito
840011_21_a
I agree, but it doesn't seem like
there's a lot of information
on it.
Silica
840011_20_a
It might be good to do a little
research first.
Kirito
840011_19_a
I see.
Well, there's still a lot I don't
know about familiars.
Kirito
840011_18_a
All I know is that she was never
like this before she died.
Silica
840011_17_a
after they get revived or something?
Kirito
840011_16_a
Hmm... I wonder if tamed monsters
are more susceptible to illness
Kirito
840011_15_a
Yes.
Silica
840011_14_a
And that's why you're worried?
Kirito
840011_13_a
Yeah, she was almost too much to
handle there for a while. She's
been acting a bit off lately.
Silica
840011_12_a
Hmm, she does look a bit down.
And to think she was so energetic
when we revived her...
Kirito
840011_11_a
Chirp chirp...
Pina
840011_10_a
Something's wrong with Pina?
Kirito
840011_9_a
Ah, well...
It's actually not me, it's Pina.
Silica
840011_8_a
Is everything okay?
You look a little down.
Kirito
840011_7_a
Oh, hi, Kirito!
Silica
840011_6_a
Hey, Silica!
Kirito
840011_5_a
What's wrong, Pina?
Silica
840011_4_a
Chirp...
Pina
840011_3_a
Pina
840011_2_a
bg_04_forest_sunset
Pina?
Silica
840011_1_a
You got it!
Yuuki
650128_30_a
Okay! Let's go gather what we need
and get to work! It'll be tough,
but I'm sure it'll be worth it!
Asuna
650128_29_a
Definitely. It's too good not to
share with all our friends!
Asuna
650128_28_a
Yay! Fire Chocolate! But you know,
one piece isn't enough. Let's mass
produce it!
Yuuki
650128_27_a
Ha ha, that's the perfect name!
From here on out, that's what
we'll call it!
Asuna
650128_26_a
Hehe, you said it! I dub this
Salamander Fire Chocolate!
Yuuki
650128_25_a
I feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Hold up. Not warm, hot!
Talk about a unique flavor!
Asuna
650128_24_a
Me neither! Aw, feel that? It just
melts in the mouth... I think I
just died and went to heaven!
Yuuki
650128_23_a
I've never had chocolate this good
in my whole life!
Asuna
650128_22_a
So theoretically, it can make real
world food taste like ash in
comparison. But this? Amazing!!
Asuna
650128_21_a
Food in VR directly stimulates the
taste buds.
Asuna
650128_20_a
I'm in chocolate heaven!!
Woohoo!!
Yuuki
650128_19_a
It's...AMAZING!!
I can't believe how good this is!
Asuna
650128_18_a
Asuna
650128_17_a
Wh-Whoa!!
Yuuki
650128_16_a
chomp
Asuna
650128_15_a
Okay, on my mark!
Ready... Set... EAT!!
Yuuki
650128_14_a
Okay! I will! Time to find out if
this chocolate is as tasty as
we've been led to believe!
Asuna
650128_13_a
Eat it, eat it, eat it!!
Yuuki
650128_12_a
I do too... Oh, what to do...
I guess we can always make
more if we get the ingredients...
Asuna
650128_11_a
Yeah, me too! I can't hold
myself back any longer!
I! Want! Chocolate!!
Yuuki
650128_10_a
It... It looks really good...
That smell, that color...
I want to try a bite!
Asuna
650128_9_a
Hmm...
Asuna
650128_8_a
So, what do you want to do now,
Asuna? We only made one each...
Should we give them away?
Yuuki
650128_7_a
I'm just hoping the flavor is
worth all the extra time and
energy!
Asuna
650128_6_a
Hehe, it really is! We can't take
any of the shortcuts our skills
usually give us...
Asuna
650128_5_a
I've kinda dabbled in the cooking
skill before now, but this is
totally different.
Yuuki
650128_4_a
But wow, am I beat! I've never
made chocolate the real way
before. It sure is tough!
Yuuki
650128_3_a
Yuuki
650128_2_a
bg_03_pub
Phew...
I think I'm done.
Asuna
650128_1_a
You're welcome. Enjoy yourselves!
Patissier NPC
650127_21_a
Patissier, thank you very much for
the ingredients and the space.
Asuna
650127_20_a
Yuuki, don't be greedy.
Let's make our chocolate.
Asuna
650127_19_a
Yikes... I know we can only make
one each, but that's a tiiiny
amount of stuff.
Yuuki
650127_18_a
This way, please. You'll find the
ingredients over here.
Patissier NPC
650127_17_a
so having an easy trial option for
those who can't beat the whole
quest is a nice thing to do.
Asuna
650127_16_a
A lot of people must be really
excited to make chocolate,
Asuna
650127_15_a
Hehe, well, it doesn't sound like
everyone has the levels and skills
to do this quest in full.
Asuna
650127_14_a
Oh, you sure strung us along!
Yuuki
650127_13_a
Really?!
Asuna
650127_12_a
Surprise! We've prepared enough
ingredients for our chocolate
trainees to each make one piece.
Patissier NPC
650127_11_a
Yes, it is extremely high.
Which is why...
Patissier NPC
650127_10_a
I know! It seems like the
difficulty on this gathering
quest is set really high!
Yuuki
650127_9_a
but it sounds like we've got a lot
of work ahead of us...
Asuna
650127_8_a
I thought we'd be able to start
making chocolate the second
we fixed the patisserie,
Asuna
650127_7_a
We need to grow cacao beans, milk
cows, and do all sorts of stuff...
Yuuki
650127_6_a
Yeah. They didn't just make the
cooking realistic, but the
ingredient-gathering too...
Yuuki
650127_5_a
Wow, it sounds like it'll be
really tough to get everything
together...
Asuna
650127_4_a
Yuuki
650127_3_a
Asuna
650127_2_a
bg_03_pub
...And that's how to get the
items you'll need.
Patissier NPC
650127_1_a
Yup!
Asuna
650125_17_a
So, first we gather the
ingredients we need here in
Salamander territory, right?
Yuuki
650125_16_a
Nope, I think we got it. Thanks!
Asuna
650125_15_a
Well, that's it!
Any questions?
Patissier NPC
650125_14_a
But we've seen things like this
before. Besides, it's the whole
point of the event, right?
Asuna
650125_13_a
Aww, but that's hard!
Yuuki
650125_12_a
I think it does. We'll have to
make it just like you do in real
life.
Asuna
650125_11_a
Waaait a sec, that doesn't mean
what I think it means, does it?
Yuuki
650125_10_a
You'll have to use the tools
in this kitchen to make it
step-by-step, from scratch.
Patissier NPC
650125_9_a
You can't use your special cooking
powers here to shorten or simplify
the process.
Patissier NPC
650125_8_a
Got it. What's the second thing?
Asuna
650125_7_a
You'll also need some local
liqueur and fruit if you want
to add in some unique flavors.
Patissier NPC
650125_6_a
Specifically cacao, sugar, cocoa
butter, and powdered milk.
Patissier NPC
650125_5_a
The first is to use ingredients
that can stand up to Salamander
territory heat.
Patissier NPC
650125_4_a
Yuuki
650125_3_a
Asuna
650125_2_a
bg_03_pub
There are two things you need to
do:
Patissier NPC
650125_1_a
Exactly. Now, I'll teach you the
proper way to make our specialty
chocolate.
Patissier NPC
650123_25_a
Yuuki
650123_24_a
Ahh, that explains things! So you
wanted to make a point: normal
techniques won't cut it here.
Asuna
650123_23_a
That puddle of melted chocolate
is your first lesson in making
Salamander-style special sweets.
Patissier NPC
650123_22_a
Magical heat? I knew Salamander
territory was hot, but I didn't
know it was magic hot...
Yuuki
650123_21_a
However, normal chocolate can't
handle the magical heat here in
Salamander lands.
Patissier NPC
650123_20_a
All the ingredients you just used
are generic items available
throughout Alfheim.
Patissier NPC
650123_19_a
What's going on here?
Did I mess up somehow?
Asuna
650123_18_a
The chocolate just insta-melted?!
Yuuki
650123_17_a
Sorry, but you failed.
Patissier NPC
650123_16_a
Hehe, right? Wait a sec...
Huh?
Asuna
650123_15_a
That cooking skill is so cool!
No mess, no fuss, just tasty
food in the blink of an eye!
Yuuki
650123_14_a
Annnd it's finished...
Asuna
650123_13_a
Yuuki
650123_12_a
Asuna
650123_11_a
That seems to be the only option.
Okay, cooking skill, activate!
Asuna
650123_10_a
Oh, maybe? Well... Why don't we
just give it a go and see what
happens?
Yuuki
650123_9_a
Didn't Rechka tell us that the
chocolate-making process here
is special?
Asuna
650123_8_a
I guess? Is that a problem?
Yuuki
650123_7_a
They just kinda left us to our own
devices. Do we just make chocolate
like normal?
Asuna
650123_6_a
What's wrong, Asuna?
Yuuki
650123_5_a
Huh...
Asuna
650123_4_a
Yuuki
650123_3_a
Asuna
650123_2_a
bg_03_pub
Here's everything you need!
Have fun making chocolate!
Patissier NPC
650123_1_a
Ahahaha!
Yuuki
650121_15_a
Y-Yuuki! Come on, I said it wasn't
like that!
Asuna
650121_14_a
But unlike you, I plan on giving
all my friends the same
super-delicious chocolate!
Yuuki
650121_13_a
Everyone in the Sleeping Knights,
I guess.
Yuuki
650121_12_a
N-No, I'm giving everyone the same
thing. What about you, Yuuki?
Who're you giving chocolate to?
Asuna
650121_11_a
Heh heh, I bet we get the normal
stuff, and Kirito gets a romantic
box of heart chocolates!
Yuuki
650121_10_a
But then I want to give some to
you, and Sinonon, and all our
friends.
Asuna
650121_9_a
W-Well, Kirito, of course...
Asuna
650121_8_a
Hehe, soooooo...
I bet I know who you're
gonna give chocolate to!
Yuuki
650121_7_a
But now we can finally get to
the holiday's main course!
Asuna
650121_6_a
Hehe, yeah! We had to fight
dragons and rebuild the town,
and everything was a mess...
Asuna
650121_5_a
I'm so excited to finally be able
to get to it! So many things got
between us and chocolate time!
Yuuki
650121_4_a
So that's where we can make that
special Valentine's Day chocolate.
Asuna
650121_3_a
Asuna
650121_2_a
bg_event_valentine_town
Look, Asuna!
There's the patisserie!
Yuuki
650121_1_a
Hehe, good! Now don't forget it!
Asuna
650118_23_a
Yeah, I guess it did... I learned
a lesson too: don't be too greedy.
Kirito
650118_22_a
Ahaha, so I guess my moral compass
saved the day, huh?
Asuna
650118_21_a
Urk... Yeah...
Kirito
650118_20_a
We dodged a bullet there, though.
We were planning on hogging the
aces all to ourselves, right?
Sinon
650118_19_a
Hehe, I hope that was it.
Asuna
650118_18_a
Maybe the admins saw that whole
thing and gave Asuna a gold star.
Kirito
650118_17_a
With the buff, he did, and
everyone had a feel-good
moment on the forums.
Sinon
650118_16_a
She earned it. She gave the ace to
that kid who was crying about how
he couldn't beat that one quest.
Sinon
650118_15_a
Asuna
650118_14_a
Sinon
650118_13_a
bg_event_wonderland
Cool, you got a special prize for
being nice. Congrats.
Kirito
650118_12_a
Thank you!
Asuna
650118_11_a
To show our appreciation of your
deeds, we present to you this
special piece of equipment.
Queen
650118_10_a
I...am honored you placed your
trust in me, Your Majesty...
Asuna
650118_9_a
That purity of heart and nobility
of purpose is what we hoped for
when we gave you this task.
Queen
650118_8_a
Rather than thinking only of your
own personal gain, you gave power
to those who needed it.
Queen
650118_7_a
They...are?
Asuna
650118_6_a
My subjects have told me they are
very pleased with your choices.
Queen
650118_5_a
Yes...? Did I carry out my
duties well?
Asuna
650118_4_a
About the job of title bestower
I entrusted you with...
Queen
650118_3_a
Yes, Your Majesty?
Asuna
650118_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Asuna, come here.
Queen
650118_1_a
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Asuna
650117_19_a
Yeah, same here.
Kirito
650117_18_a
I'm happy with whatever you decide
here.
Sinon
650117_17_a
Yeah, but I'm just teasing you.
The queen asked you to do this,
so it's your call.
Sinon
650117_16_a
Sorry... You wanted aces, didn't
you?
Asuna
650117_15_a
Yeah. You gave me the king of
spades and Sinon the king of
diamonds.
Kirito
650117_14_a
I get that, but I still don't get
why you didn't give US aces.
Sinon
650117_13_a
But... Though I like buffing
myself, I'm sure other people
need this more than me.
Asuna
650117_12_a
Save an ace for yourself, at the
very least.
Kirito
650117_11_a
I get the urge to hoard, but I'd
say just hand them out and be
done with it.
Sinon
650117_10_a
Yeah, but I haven't handed out
any of the aces yet.
Asuna
650117_9_a
Sinon
650117_8_a
Asuna
650117_7_a
It looks like you picked cards
that suit all of our friends.
Kirito
650117_6_a
I'm definitely happy to get better
at smashing stuff. Smashing stuff
feels good.
Liz
650117_5_a
I'm working on an endurance quest,
so this HP buff is going to be a
huge help! Thanks!
Silica
650117_4_a
Liz
650117_3_a
Silica
650117_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Whoa, I'm even faster now!
Thanks, Asuna!
Leafa
650117_1_a
You're right. I'll take some time,
and make sure that I give everyone
the card that suits them most.
Asuna
650115_34_a
Agreed. She'd break the sound
barrier. Anyway, you don't have
to pick now. Think on it.
Sinon
650115_33_a
I guess so, but...I'm kinda afraid
to see her get any faster...
Kirito
650115_32_a
Yeah, she'd be able to wring more
use out of it than I could.
Asuna
650115_31_a
You're going to give Yuuki the ace
of clubs?
Kirito
650115_30_a
Oh, wait! I should message Yuuki
and see if she wants it.
Asuna
650115_29_a
I'm a big fan of agility, so I
guess I'll take the ace of clubs.
Asuna
650115_28_a
Can I have the ace of spades?
I'm DPS, and I like to min/max.
Kirito
650115_27_a
Archers are glass cannons, so I
need every point of defense I
can get.
Sinon
650115_26_a
My ranged attacks have been
earning me a lot of hate lately...
Sinon
650115_25_a
Hehe, I call dibs on diamonds.
Sinon
650115_24_a
Oooh! We all get aces, right?
Kirito
650115_23_a
Oh, by the way! I can give us
titles too!
Asuna
650115_22_a
Yeaaah...
Kirito
650115_21_a
Kirito, you're still mad about
how he beat us in the dungeon
earlier, aren't you?
Sinon
650115_20_a
Really? Now that's just mean.
He's definitely more than a three.
Asuna
650115_19_a
Hmm... I'd say Klein's worth
about...the three of spades?
Kirito
650115_18_a
Alright, I'm going to think about
how to distribute these. Do you
guys have any ideas?
Asuna
650115_17_a
Ha ha, for sure. But we earned
the right sorta fair and square,
so we get to pass them out.
Kirito
650115_16_a
I see this causing a whole lot of
grief and whining on the forums.
Sinon
650115_15_a
All of these titles give buffs, so
I guess I don't have to worry too
much about who I give what to.
Asuna
650115_14_a
Yeah. I guess handing these
out is one of the rewards for
finishing the dungeon first.
Asuna
650115_13_a
So you can give these titles to
people from any party, right?
Kirito
650115_12_a
Standard card rules.
Two is the weakest,
ace is the strongest.
Asuna
650115_11_a
Next, the number on the card
indicates your rank. Stronger
cards give better bonuses.
Asuna
650115_10_a
Oh, interesting.
Sinon
650115_9_a
Originally, spades were swords.
The design has changed over the
centuries, though.
Asuna
650115_8_a
Why do spades increase attack?
They look like leaves to me.
Sinon
650115_7_a
Hearts raise your hit points,
because...yeah. Lastly, spades
raise your attack.
Asuna
650115_6_a
Diamonds are hard, so they raise
your defense temporarily.
Asuna
650115_5_a
Each suit gives a different buff.
Clubs raise agility, because wind
rustles clover, apparently?
Asuna
650115_4_a
Kirito
650115_3_a
Asuna
650115_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
What sort of bonuses do these
card titles give?
Sinon
650115_1_a
Ha ha, it could be pretty fun to
go around rating players.
Kirito
650113_19_a
I guess that's the quest
backstory this time?
Sinon
650113_18_a
So they delegated responsibility
for this job to me.
Asuna
650113_17_a
They've kinda been letting the
kingdom go to the dogs lately,
and there's a ton to do.
Asuna
650113_16_a
But...why Asuna? It seems like
something the king or queen
should do themselves.
Kirito
650113_15_a
Apparently.
Asuna
650113_14_a
Okay, sure. So this is separate
from the card slot you use to play
poker in the dungeon, I take it?
Sinon
650113_13_a
Pretty much! Each suit and number
gives a special bonus effect too.
Asuna
650113_12_a
So... In other words, you have to
rank all the players as cards?
Kirito
650113_11_a
In this country, these titles are
sort of like official jobs.
Asuna
650113_10_a
I mean, like Kirito will be the
ace of spades, you're the jack
of hearts, et cetera.
Asuna
650113_9_a
...Excuse me?
Sinon
650113_8_a
Well, she wants me to give a bunch
of them card titles!
Asuna
650113_7_a
So the 3D Labyrinth is filled with
players now, right?
Asuna
650113_6_a
Ooh, a new quest. What is it?
Kirito
650113_5_a
And it's pretty unique!
Asuna
650113_4_a
Sinon
650113_3_a
Kirito
650113_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
The queen just gave me a job!
Asuna
650113_1_a
Well, something's got Asuna
excited.
Sinon
650111_18_a
Guys, wait until you hear this!
Asuna
650111_17_a
You got me... Hey, it's Asuna.
Kirito
650111_16_a
Honestly. What was with that?
Sinon
650111_15_a
I guess it's more that he's no
longer gibbering insane, but
who knows?
Kirito
650111_14_a
Ha ha, yeah. That was...creepy.
But apparently, he's cool with
Asuna being her friend.
Kirito
650111_13_a
Is it okay for Asuna to get so
close to her? The king literally
locked her up to prevent that.
Sinon
650111_12_a
I guess somewhere in her NPC
heart, she knows that Asuna's
on her side.
Kirito
650111_11_a
It was Asuna who really hung in
there and went for the happy
ending.
Kirito
650111_10_a
Yeah, seriously. I guess because
you and I were all ready and
willing to take down the king?
Kirito
650111_9_a
Her Majesty sure has taken
a liking to her.
Sinon
650111_8_a
Yeah, the queen called her in to
have a chat.
Kirito
650111_7_a
Kirito
650111_6_a
bg_event_wonderland
Have you seen Asuna?
Sinon
650111_5_a
What is it?
Asuna
650111_4_a
I have a boon to ask of you.
Queen
650111_3_a
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm here.
Asuna
650111_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Is Asuna here?
Queen
650111_1_a
Yes, we should!
Yui
650098_26_a
You're right. We should tell the
head priest what we've learned.
Asuna
650098_25_a
And the area it lives in is pretty
hard to get to!
Yui
650098_24_a
I'm getting the feeling that
little brat tricked us.
Asuna
650098_23_a
It's possible. Oh no! The entrance
has disappeared again.
Asuna
650098_22_a
We cannot rely on our sense of
direction. Was something warping
spacetime?
Yui
650098_21_a
All we did was keep walking.
There weren't any forks in the
road or anything...
Yui
650098_20_a
Warp back to the temple
grounds? I think so...
Asuna
650098_19_a
Mommy, did we just...?
Yui
650098_18_a
Yui
650098_17_a
bg_event_japan_castle
Huh?
Asuna
650098_16_a
Asuna
650098_15_a
Okay!
Yui
650098_14_a
Let's run after it!
Asuna
650098_13_a
Hey, Mommy! It's getting away!
Yui
650098_12_a
Hee!
Monster
650098_11_a
Zashiki-warashi... The little
childlike spirits that live in old
houses and like to play?
Yui
650098_10_a
I feel like I've seen a creature
like that somewhere before.
Is it a zashiki-warashi?
Asuna
650098_9_a
Hee hee!
Monster
650098_8_a
Oh, okay. Good.
Yui
650098_7_a
Hehe, no, Yui, I'm fine. That one
was still on the cute end of
the spectrum.
Asuna
650098_6_a
Are you scared?
Yui
650098_5_a
What was that? Some sort of ghost
or monster from Asuka Empire?
Asuna
650098_4_a
Asuna
650098_3_a
Mommy, look out!
Yui
650098_2_a
bg_02_forest
Hee hee hee!
???
650098_1_a
Okay!
Yui
650097_16_a
So come on, Yui! Let's investigate
this unknown area of the shrine
together!
Asuna
650097_15_a
Aww, Mommy!
Yui
650097_14_a
And besides, I have to look after
you! I can't let my own daughter
see me cowering in fear!
Asuna
650097_13_a
Yes, it'll be fine! I really don't
feel uneasy around them in
the slightest.
Asuna
650097_12_a
Really? Are you sure about that?
Yui
650097_11_a
Let's investigate this on our own.
Asuna
650097_10_a
No. They might disappear when we
go to get him.
Asuna
650097_9_a
Should we call for the head
priest?
Yui
650097_8_a
I-I'm not sure.
Asuna
650097_7_a
Why do they keep appearing and
disappearing?
Yui
650097_6_a
Wow! The torii gates are back!
Asuna
650097_5_a
Over there! Look over there!
Yui
650097_4_a
What is it, Yui?
Asuna
650097_3_a
Asuna
650097_2_a
bg_02_forest
Mommy, look!
Yui
650097_1_a
But I wonder why that is...
Asuna
650095_17_a
The torii gates didn't bother me
at all. It's the horror stuff that
I can't handle.
Asuna
650095_16_a
Hehe, I'm fine, Yui. Thank you for
asking.
Asuna
650095_15_a
Are you okay, Mommy?
Are you scared?
Yui
650095_14_a
Precisely.
Head Priest
650095_13_a
I see. So even the quests can be
modeled on Japanese supernatural
phenomena.
Asuna
650095_12_a
Tales of oracles and good fortune,
for instance. It's not all doom
and gloom.
Head Priest
650095_11_a
Ha ha! There are quite a number of
ghost stories in Japanese culture,
yes, but there are other tales.
Head Priest
650095_10_a
Are you talking about ghosts and
other spirits?
Asuna
650095_9_a
I've heard tell that some of the
more mysterious phenomena
manifest themselves as quests.
Head Priest
650095_8_a
Asuka Empire draws on the history
and folklore of Japan to fill out
its Japan-themed world.
Head Priest
650095_7_a
Yui
650095_6_a
See what?
Asuna
650095_5_a
Ah, I see...
Head Priest
650095_4_a
Mommy, they're gone! They were all
here just a second ago!
Yui
650095_3_a
Yui
650095_2_a
bg_02_forest
Wait... It was just around here...
What's going on?!
Asuna
650095_1_a
Of course.
Asuna
650093_16_a
Would you show me the way?
Head Priest
650093_15_a
Asuna
650093_14_a
Really? But...how?
Yui
650093_13_a
W-Wait just a minute.
I've never seen this place
you speak of.
Head Priest
650093_12_a
Yes. Are we responsible for
cleaning that as well?
Asuna
650093_11_a
bg_event_japan_castle
Torii-lined path...? Like Fushimi
Inari, you say?
Head Priest
650093_10_a
Good idea.
Asuna
650093_9_a
Let's ask the head priest!
Yui
650093_8_a
Though we should probably double
check, now that I think about
it...
Asuna
650093_7_a
Ha ha, no, that would be asking
the impossible of just two people.
Asuna
650093_6_a
Do we have to clean all of that
too?
Yui
650093_5_a
It looks just like the Fushimi
Inari shrine in Kyoto...
Asuna
650093_4_a
There are a lot of them lining
this stone path. I can't tell
where they end!
Yui
650093_3_a
Yui
650093_2_a
bg_02_forest
Was that torii gate here
yesterday?
Asuna
650093_1_a
What is it, Mommy?
Yui
650091_21_a
Hm?
Asuna
650091_20_a
It is big, though, I'll say that.
There are still parts of it
that I haven't seen yet.
Asuna
650091_19_a
Great!
Yui
650091_18_a
Absolutely. The actual cleaning
process has been greatly
simplified. I think we can do it.
Asuna
650091_17_a
Okay! But this shrine's quite big.
Will we be able to clean it all
by ourselves?
Yui
650091_16_a
Yui
650091_15_a
Next we must clean the grounds.
Asuna
650091_14_a
Well then, let's go!
Yui
650091_13_a
I think they just might!
Asuna
650091_12_a
Now that you've converted over
to Asuka Empire from ALO,
Asuna
650091_11_a
I see! Will my stats go up too?
Yui
650091_10_a
Right. And it comes with a little
stat boost, so there's extra
incentive to follow the rules.
Asuna
650091_9_a
Oh yes, that's right. We have to
clean ourselves before we enter
the shrine.
Yui
650091_8_a
First come the purification rites.
Asuna
650091_7_a
Okay! So, how do we do that?
Yui
650091_6_a
Me too. Now let's give this
shrine maiden sim a shot,
shall we?
Asuna
650091_5_a
Thank you! I'm so happy we get to
do this shrine quest together.
Yui
650091_4_a
Oh, Yui, it looks fantastic!
Asuna
650091_3_a
Asuna
650091_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
How does this look, Mommy?
Yui
650091_1_a
Yeah! I'm ready to go!
Asuna
650088_14_a
Let's hurry on with our search
and find our quarry.
Alice
650088_13_a
Hmph. Anyway, we can only wear
these for a limited time.
Alice
650088_12_a
Ahaha... Hah...
Y-You're just imagining it?
Asuna
650088_11_a
I feel like I'm getting more
attention now...
Alice
650088_10_a
Gah... I think your plan to avoid
notice backfired, Asuna...
Alice
650088_9_a
I didn't know they made avatars
like that! I wish I looked like
her!
Player B
650088_8_a
Whoa! Look at that blonde beauty
over there! She's a knockout!
Player A
650088_7_a
Hehe, thank you!
Asuna
650088_6_a
But I must say, you look
fantastic in a kimono.
Alice
650088_5_a
It is? I-I mean, physical
appearance is of no concern
to an Integrity Knight...
Alice
650088_4_a
Wow, it looks SO good on you!
It's pretty...
No... It's BEAUTIFUL!
Asuna
650088_3_a
Asuna
650088_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
So this is a kimono...
Alice
650088_1_a
Excellent! Then I shall don this
strange robe. We can afford it,
right?
Alice
650087_26_a
I...agree with you?
Maybe it'll help in some way?
Asuna
650087_25_a
What was that? Speak up.
Alice
650087_24_a
It's kinda more that it affects
in-game mechanics and whatnot...
mumble
mumble
Asuna
650087_23_a
Oh, well... Actually...
Asuna
650087_22_a
Perhaps this garment's powers to
alter chance and fate will aid us
in our search.
Alice
650087_21_a
We're looking for someone, right?
Alice
650087_20_a
R-Really?! You will?!
Asuna
650087_19_a
Fine. I will deign to don this
kimono.
Alice
650087_18_a
...
Alice
650087_17_a
It's New Year's, so everyone's
looking for a little bit of good
fortune.
Asuna
650087_16_a
Like, maybe the person you're
waiting for will show up,
or you'll find treasure...
Asuna
650087_15_a
Umm... It's a lucky outfit,
so good things will happen
if you wear it?
Asuna
650087_14_a
Asuna, she speaks in tongues.
Do her ramblings make sense
to you?
Alice
650087_13_a
Of course, it's only available
during the New Year's celebration!
Get it while it's hot!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
650087_12_a
It increases your evasion,
accuracy, and item drop rate.
Really, it pays for itself!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
650087_11_a
Excuse me! I thought you might
like this kimono. It raises your
luck!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
650087_10_a
Asuna...
Alice
650087_9_a
I need to forget clothes and get
my priorities straight...
Asuna
650087_8_a
But we've got an important task
we need to focus on now, don't we?
Asuna
650087_7_a
And I suppose I just got carried
away...
Asuna
650087_6_a
It's just that you're so pretty,
I thought you'd look amazing
in a kimono...
Asuna
650087_5_a
I guess I sorta got sidetracked...
Sorry...
Asuna
650087_4_a
Oh... That's a good question,
actually...
Asuna
650087_3_a
Asuna
650087_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Asuna... Why are you so fixated on
forcing me to wear some sort of
flamboyant garment?
Alice
650087_1_a
I want all the details, please!
Asuna
650085_19_a
It's a New Year's celebration
special!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
650085_18_a
You do?
Asuna
650085_17_a
I have a suggestion! If you cannot
afford to buy, how about renting?
We offer that service as well.
Dry Goods Shopkeep
650085_16_a
I see. Then our choice is simple.
The cheapest outfit is sufficient.
Can we go now?
Alice
650085_15_a
We just got here, so we're
basically broke...
Asuna
650085_14_a
Not in this game... Er, I mean,
this world. The currency is
different.
Asuna
650085_13_a
You're worried about the price?
Aren't you and Kirito wealthy
beyond compare?
Alice
650085_12_a
Y-Yeep!
So many zeroes...
Asuna
650085_11_a
Those? Most of them fall into this
price range.
Dry Goods Shopkeep
650085_10_a
How much are those pretty kimonos?
Asuna
650085_9_a
But...
Excuse me, miss!
Asuna
650085_8_a
I repeat: stop wasting time.
Looking good has nothing to
do with our purpose here.
Alice
650085_7_a
Don't rush me! I'm comparing
fabrics and designs. I want to
find something that suits you!
Asuna
650085_6_a
Asuna, stop wasting time.
Just pick something already.
Alice
650085_5_a
Hmmm...
Asuna
650085_4_a
Alice
650085_3_a
Asuna
650085_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
The outfit on this shelf is in
the latest fashion and quite
affordable!
Dry Goods Shopkeep
650085_1_a
Asuna...?
Alice
650083_18_a
This is an old-timey setting, so
we'll need a dry goods store...
Heh heh heh...
Asuna
650083_17_a
Okay, Alice, we're buying you a
new outfit! No arguments! Let's
find a local clothing shop!
Asuna
650083_16_a
Y-Yeah, it'll be fine. Probably.
Asuna
650083_15_a
What is it, Asuna?
Is everything all right?
Alice
650083_14_a
Oh... Wait...
Asuna
650083_13_a
You don't like being the center of
attention, right? Switch outfits
and they'll leave you alone.
Asuna
650083_12_a
B-But I have no desire to don
the local garb!
Alice
650083_11_a
Let's go buy you some local
clothes. That way you'll blend in
and people will stop staring...
Asuna
650083_10_a
C-Calm down, Alice! You don't have
to get so violent!
Asuna
650083_9_a
Fah! You there, all of you!!
I am not some object on display!
Look elsewhere, or face my blade!
Alice
650083_8_a
No wonder you stand out.
Asuna
650083_7_a
Ah, of course! I'm a Blade Maiden,
but you're still dressed like a
European knight.
Asuna
650083_6_a
Huh? Oh... Yeah, I guess so.
Everyone's staring at you...
Asuna
650083_5_a
Am I imagining it, or are the eyes
of the masses lingering upon me?
Alice
650083_4_a
However...what?
Asuna
650083_3_a
Asuna
650083_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
However...
Alice
650083_1_a
Hehe... Yeah, you're right!
Let's go!
Asuna
650081_16_a
Bah. Enough of that. We must
begin our search for the Hi-Mob.
Alice
650081_15_a
Alice...
Asuna
650081_14_a
It...seems like an eternity ago
that Eugeo and I came to your
land.
Alice
650081_13_a
Hehe, don't worry! None of us hold
it against you. It was just a
misunderstanding!
Asuna
650081_12_a
W-Well...
Alice
650081_11_a
Alice, you're not still feeling
bad about what happened when
you first got to Alfheim, are you?
Asuna
650081_10_a
True... And your point is taken.
Leaping about wildly here could
lead to unnecessary conflict.
Alice
650081_9_a
For example, look at me. I don't
have wings here, so I can't fly.
Asuna
650081_8_a
Well... Maybe. This world probably
operates on different principles,
so it's not the same at all.
Asuna
650081_7_a
but at its heart, this world is
the same as yours or mine...
correct?
Alice
650081_6_a
Of course. But this is merely a
different culture. The customs
and manners may be different,
Alice
650081_5_a
You say that, but we just got
here. There's so much we don't
know... Let's be careful.
Asuna
650081_4_a
Our plan to split into groups to
search for the Hi-Mob was a wise
one. We will be successful.
Alice
650081_3_a
Alice
650081_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Alright! Let's get started!
Asuna
650081_1_a
Ha ha, I can totally see it!
Suguha
650078_19_a
Hehe, I can see Kirito checking
his mail and going "b-but why
didn't they invite me, waah"!
Asuna
650078_18_a
We're going on a date today!
Let's taunt him by sending him a
bunch of pictures of us together!
Suguha
650078_17_a
That's a great idea! Kazuto's
chilling alone at home today...
but forget him!
Suguha
650078_16_a
I'll keep you company, if you
don't mind! Let's at least grab
lunch!
Asuna
650078_15_a
Anyway, enough chatting! I've
got to go buy a whole pile of
presents today!
Suguha
650078_14_a
Suguha...
Asuna
650078_13_a
It's good to know that my
brother's girlfriend gets him.
Suguha
650078_12_a
I mean, you obviously care about
him, and you're considerate enough
to know what would make him happy.
Suguha
650078_11_a
I'm glad that Kazuto chose to fall
in love with you, that's all.
Suguha
650078_10_a
What do you mean?
Asuna
650078_9_a
I guess I'm relieved, in a way.
Suguha
650078_8_a
Yeah! Well, at the very least,
we both know Kazuto well enough
to know what he likes.
Suguha
650078_7_a
I guess we think the same way,
huh?
Asuna
650078_6_a
Hehe, well, thanks anyway.
I'm just amazed we were after the
same present in VR and real life!
Asuna
650078_5_a
Don't sweat it! You let me have
that scarf back in ALO. I'm just
repaying the favor!
Suguha
650078_4_a
Suguha
650078_3_a
Yui
650078_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Suguha, thanks for letting me have
this one!
Asuna
650078_1_a
I can't believe this is happening
again.
Asuna
650077_22_a
Don't tell me you're...here to buy
a present for Kazuto?
Suguha
650077_21_a
Ahaha... Hey, Asuna...?
Suguha
650077_20_a
What are you doing in an
electronics store in the middle
of--Oh no...
Asuna
650077_19_a
Asuna?!
Suguha
650077_18_a
Suguha
650077_17_a
Yui
650077_16_a
Suguha?!
Asuna
650077_15_a
No way?!
???
650077_14_a
Hmm... Ah, this is it!
I was eyeing this model!
Asuna
650077_13_a
Asuna
650077_12_a
Mommy, the section you're looking
for is over here.
Yui
650077_11_a
I try to be. Now, I just hope
I can find a good deal!
Asuna
650077_10_a
Now that's my mommy!
You're always prepared!
Yui
650077_9_a
I've got a short list of models
that match Kirito's needs.
Asuna
650077_8_a
Hehe, oh, I know! I spent forever
scouring the Internet for info.
Asuna
650077_7_a
There are a wide variety of
models on sale. The more types
of port, the more expensive.
Yui
650077_6_a
A portable charger? Processing...
Search complete!
Yui
650077_5_a
So, I thought I'd get him a
portable charger.
Asuna
650077_4_a
Totally! Kirito's been complaining
about how all his gizmos'
batteries run out all the time.
Asuna
650077_3_a
Asuna
650077_2_a
bg_os_town_1
So, do you have any ideas of what
you want to get him?
Yui
650077_1_a
I just hope he appreciates all
the effort I put in for him.
Asuna
650075_14_a
Oh, I see. You're getting him a
present in VR and in the real
world. That's very nice of you.
Yui
650075_13_a
One for him in the real world!
Mr. Kazuto Kirigaya needs a
present too!
Asuna
650075_12_a
So, what sort of gift are you
going to buy today?
Yui
650075_11_a
Hehe, I bet Daddy will love it!
Yui
650075_10_a
I thought that if he's going to
rough it, he might as well bring
along a sleeping bag.
Asuna
650075_9_a
Yeah. He's always zipping around
and taking naps in weird places.
Asuna
650075_8_a
You got him a sleeping bag, right?
Yui
650075_7_a
Yeah, but that was in ALO!
I found this great gift after I
let Leafa get dibs on that scarf.
Asuna
650075_6_a
But didn't you just buy Daddy
one the other day?
Yui
650075_5_a
We're shopping for a Christmas
present for Kirito!
Asuna
650075_4_a
Yup! But where are we off to
today, Mommy?
Yui
650075_3_a
Yui
650075_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Ready to go, Yui?
Asuna
650075_1_a
Yeah, I bet he'll love it!
Leafa
650073_19_a
Yeah, Kirito ALWAYS wears black.
You can't go wrong if you get him
something dark and dreary.
Asuna
650073_18_a
Yeah, seriously! This scarf suits
him to a T. Black, but with just
a hint of a stylish design to it.
Leafa
650073_17_a
Still, I'm impressed we both
picked out the same thing! I guess
we know our audience, huh?
Asuna
650073_16_a
It's okay, I don't mind. I'll just
have to think of something else
to give him.
Asuna
650073_15_a
Are you sure you want to let me
have this one, Asuna? You were
here first.
Leafa
650073_14_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Hehe, I can't believe we were
both thinking of getting him the
same present!
Asuna
650073_13_a
It...probably is. Ha ha...
Leafa
650073_12_a
Hold up... It's not for who I
think it is, is it?
Asuna
650073_11_a
Too?
Leafa
650073_10_a
Hi there, Leafa! You're looking
for scarves too?
Asuna
650073_9_a
Asuna?!
Leafa
650073_8_a
Leafa
650073_7_a
Hey, I know that voice!
Asuna
650073_6_a
Excuse me, but I'm looking for
this scarf. Do you have one in
stock that I can see up close?
???
650073_5_a
But which one of these would look
the best on him? Hmm... This is
hard...
Asuna
650073_4_a
Wow, they're all so nice!
I'm glad I came to see the
real deal.
Asuna
650073_3_a
Asuna
650073_2_a
bg_05_agil_shop
Here are the scarves you wanted
to see, ma'am. We have all three
types in stock.
Shopkeeper
650073_1_a
Well... Time to hit the market!
Asuna
650071_18_a
But it's probably good he came
home. I should be doing this in
person, anyway...
Asuna
650071_17_a
It's not like I could just say I
was shopping for his Christmas
present or anything...
Asuna
650071_16_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Phew... That was close...
Asuna
650071_15_a
Asuna
650071_14_a
Oh...kay? Have fun, I guess.
Kirito
650071_13_a
W-Well, yeah, but...
I...forgot something?
Asuna
650071_12_a
Food shopping? Didn't you just go
on a massive buying spree for
that stuff yesterday?
Kirito
650071_11_a
I...need to buy some ingredients
for tonight's dinner. Yeah,
that's it.
Asuna
650071_10_a
...Uh, I'm going to just...head
out for a bit.
Asuna
650071_9_a
Oh. Cool.
Kirito
650071_8_a
Oh... Well, to answer your
question, I'm looking at the
equipment shop's item list.
Asuna
650071_7_a
Uh, just now...?
Kirito
650071_6_a
Gah! Kirito?!
When did you get home?!
Asuna
650071_5_a
Hey Asuna, what are you doing?
Kirito
650071_4_a
Wait, but I really like the color
on this one...
Asuna
650071_3_a
Kirito
650071_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Hmm... This could be nice...
Asuna
650071_1_a
Rika
650058_35_a
Waaah! Stop staring at meee!!
Asuna
650058_34_a
Keiko
650058_33_a
Stop hiding, and come clean!
Hands at your sides, show us
what you got!
Shino
650058_32_a
N-No, and that doesn't even make
any sense! Come on!
Asuna
650058_31_a
I should have known! You just have
to be the best at everything,
don't you!
Rika
650058_30_a
Asuna
650058_29_a
I thought it was weird that our
model of health and fitness here
had stiff shoulders!
Rika
650058_28_a
Keiko
650058_27_a
Grrr... So I was right!
Shino
650058_26_a
Rika
650058_25_a
G-Guys...? Can we please stop
talking about this? And staring?
It's embarrassing...

Shino
650058_23_a
A-Asuna?! Really? Is that true...?
I'm... I'm so jealous!!
Keiko
650058_22_a
Asuna
650058_21_a
Wh-What?! She has?! Hold on,
let me take a closer look!
Rika
650058_20_a
Keiko
650058_19_a
I beg to differ! Look at those
things! You've gotten bigger!
Shino
650058_18_a
Rika
650058_17_a
U-Uhh, err... I don't know what
you're talking about...?
Asuna
650058_16_a
Keiko
650058_15_a
Asuna! You lied to us! You know
very well what caused that pain
you complained about!
Shino
650058_14_a
Rika
650058_13_a
Get...what?
Asuna
650058_12_a
Keiko
650058_11_a
Anyway, now that I've had a chance
to check here in the real world,
I finally get it.
Shino
650058_10_a
Rika
650058_9_a
I know! Yay!
Asuna
650058_8_a
Hehe... Asuna, aren't you happy?
Everyone is sort of agreeing with
you now!
Keiko
650058_7_a
But people do say sickness and
health start with the mind.
Maybe it's not entirely bogus.
Shino
650058_6_a
Keiko
650058_5_a
We have a tiny sample size here
and zero proof of causation...
Shino
650058_4_a
See! I told you it would work!
Asuna
650058_3_a
Asuna
650058_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Wow! My eyes feel much better!
And I feel, like, a thousand times
more rested now!
Rika
650058_1_a
...
Sinon
650057_36_a
Sinon
650057_35_a
E-Err, well... H-Hey, must have
just slept on them wrong.
Ha. Ha ha.
Asuna
650057_34_a
I find it surprising you have
problems with stiff shoulders.
You're not, like, eighty.
Liz
650057_33_a
Silica
650057_32_a
Hmm... Fishy. You always stretch
before a workout, you've got great
posture, and you're really fit.
Liz
650057_31_a
Oh, uh...
W-Well...
Asuna
650057_30_a
Asuna
650057_29_a
Hey, Asuna? Mind telling me how
exactly your shoulders ended up
stiff?
Sinon
650057_28_a
Liz
650057_27_a
Sinon... What's wrong?
You look...thoughtful.
Silica
650057_26_a
...
Sinon
650057_25_a
Sinon
650057_24_a
Great! I'm sure you'll feel way
better soon!
Asuna
650057_23_a
Silica
650057_22_a
Wow, okay. I guess we're coming
here every day for a week, then.
Liz
650057_21_a
Hmm... About a week?
Asuna
650057_20_a
Asuna
650057_19_a
How long until you got better,
Asuna?
Sinon
650057_18_a
Liz
650057_17_a
But not instantly, right?
It'll take a day or two?
Silica
650057_16_a
Sinon
650057_15_a
Oh come on!
It really works, honest!
Asuna
650057_14_a
Silica
650057_13_a
You said it.
Liz
650057_12_a
Asuna
650057_11_a
Heh, putting aside whether or not
it can magically heal you, it was
worth coming just for the soak.
Sinon
650057_10_a
Ahhh, that's the stuff... Mmm...
Liz
650057_9_a
Silica
650057_8_a
Riiight. Might as well give it
a shot...
Liz
650057_7_a
Sinon
650057_6_a
It says that kind of murky spring
over there helps with tired eyes
and general exhaustion.
Asuna
650057_5_a
Actually, yeah. I've been stuck at
my computer doing homework,
and my eyes are super tired...
Liz
650057_4_a
Liz, do you have any aches or pains right now?
Silica
650057_3_a
Silica
650057_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Hey, look at all the things they
claim these hot springs can cure.
How credible.
Liz
650057_1_a
Right...
Rika
650055_24_a
YES! A million times yes!
I'll take you there!
Asuna
650055_23_a
Asuna
650055_22_a
Alright, sure. You guys want to
hit that hot spring tonight?
Rika
650055_21_a
Either way, you need proof.
Rika, why not try it for yourself?
Shino
650055_20_a
Keiko
650055_19_a
Eh. It's probably just the placebo
effect.
Shino
650055_18_a
H-Hey, no need to get so upset...
It's not that we don't believe
you... We just need more evidence.
Rika
650055_17_a
Rika
650055_16_a
sniff
...
No one believes me...
Asuna
650055_15_a
I wasn't sore to begin with,
so I can't corroborate her story.
Shino
650055_14_a
Well, how do you feel after a few
days in the water, Shino?
Keiko
650055_13_a
But I assumed it was just there to
help create that hot spring vibe.
Shino
650055_12_a
Keiko
650055_11_a
Hmm... I remember seeing a sign
saying those springs had curative
properties...
Shino
650055_10_a
virtual hot springs aren't going
to have an actual physical effect
on your real life body.
Rika
650055_9_a
And I'm trying to tell her that's
utter garbage. I don't care how
realistic the experience is,
Rika
650055_8_a
Rika
650055_7_a
Shinonon! I was telling them how a
few days in ALO's hot springs
totally fixed my stiff shoulders!
Asuna
650055_6_a
Hey. What's with all the yelling?
Shino
650055_5_a
H-Hey, easy there, you two...
No need to get so upset...
Keiko
650055_4_a
Yeaaah, I'm not buying it.
It's ridiculous, and you're
being ridiculous.
Rika
650055_3_a
Rika
650055_2_a
bg_os_cafe
I-I mean it, nothing happened!
Honest!!
Asuna
650055_1_a
sigh
Your attempt to change the
subject is painfully obvious.
Fine. You're off the hook today.
Sinon
650053_18_a
Th-There's another hot spring just
over that hill that's totally
unique! Let's go check it out!
Asuna
650053_17_a
Wh-What are you talking about,
Sinonon? O-Oh, by the way!
Asuna
650053_16_a
Hmmm... Nope, can't do that.
Details, now!
Sinon
650053_15_a
Eep! I did nothing nowhere!
Forget I said anything!
Asuna
650053_14_a
Hold the phone. You did what
with Kirito where now?
Sinon
650053_13_a
Come to think of it, the first
time I took a bath was at
Kirito's...
Asuna
650053_12_a
Eventually I met Kirito, and he
taught me that life in VR could
be filled with hope and joy.
Asuna
650053_11_a
Asuna...
Sinon
650053_10_a
I was so upset and depressed,
I barely even ate, much less took
a bath. It seemed so pointless...
Asuna
650053_9_a
I was the same way when I first
learned I was trapped in SAO.
Asuna
650053_8_a
I didn't see the point.
Sinon
650053_7_a
It is nice. You know, back when
I was soloing in GGO, I never even
thought of taking a virtual bath.
Sinon
650053_6_a
But I'm definitely getting the
relaxing vibes here... Mmm...
Asuna
650053_5_a
Totally... It feels a little
different from a hot spring
in the real world...
Asuna
650053_4_a
That hits the spot...
Sinon
650053_3_a
Sinon
650053_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Oooh yeaaah...
Asuna
650053_1_a
Yeah! Race you there!
Asuna
650051_19_a
So what are we waiting for?
Let's hit the baths!
Sinon
650051_18_a
Ahaha, wow... It must have slipped
my mind in the rush to get
everything up and running!
Asuna
650051_17_a
Heh, you were the one who wanted
hot springs so bad. I thought
you'd be the first in the water.
Sinon
650051_16_a
Ah! You're right!
I completely forgot!
Asuna
650051_15_a
We've been running around, setting
up everything, but we haven't
touched the water yet.
Sinon
650051_14_a
Soak in a hot spring, of course.
Sinon
650051_13_a
Huh? There is? What?
Asuna
650051_12_a
Hehe, yeah... But Asuna, there's
one extremely important thing
we still have to do.
Sinon
650051_11_a
Yeah, it certainly was a lot of
work. It feels like forever ago
that we started on this project.
Asuna
650051_10_a
We chopped trees, built buildings,
scoured the mountain for a hot
spring source, battled monsters...
Sinon
650051_9_a
It better be, considering all the
effort we put into it.
Sinon
650051_8_a
Look at all the people...
I guess our town really is a hit.
Asuna
650051_7_a
Race you to the water!
Player B
650051_6_a
There's an outdoor hot spring
over there! Let's go check it out!
Player A
650051_5_a
Wow! This place is actually pretty
fantastic! I'm glad we came!
Player B
650051_4_a
Sinon
650051_3_a
Asuna
650051_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
So this is that new hot spring
town everyone's talking about,
huh?
Player A
650051_1_a
Yeah. I want both the cheerleaders
and the athletes to give it their
all today!
Asuna
650048_15_a
But this will really get everyone
fired up! Especially the people
cheering on the sidelines!
Yui
650048_14_a
After all, Argo gave it to me
instead of that info.
Asuna
650048_13_a
Well, I guess "bought" isn't quite
true...
Asuna
650048_12_a
Dude!
That's so cool!
Red Team Player
650048_11_a
A giant red team banner!
Yui
650048_10_a
Of course I am. Look--I bought
something to help me help you
even more.
Asuna
650048_9_a
I hope you're still okay pulling
double duty as an athlete and
our cheerleader!
Red Team Player
650048_8_a
This'll totally help us get
through the rest of the day!
Red Team Player
650048_7_a
You're the best, Asuna!
Red Team Player
650048_6_a
There's enough for everyone,
so drink up!
Asuna
650048_5_a
Awesome!
Thank you so much!
Red Team Player
650048_4_a
We brought everyone something
nice and cold to drink!
Yui
650048_3_a
Yui
650048_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Sorry to keep you waiting, guys!
Asuna
650048_1_a
Thank you, Yui!
Asuna
650047_23_a
I understand. I respect your
decision, Mommy!
Yui
650047_22_a
That's why I didn't want the info.
Asuna
650047_21_a
Yes, that is definitely a risk.
Yui
650047_20_a
Some people will still see it
that way, right?
Asuna
650047_19_a
Even if most people would think
fair's fair, and that information
wasn't really cheating...
Asuna
650047_18_a
I fought tooth and nail in the
bloody halls of academia, and it
made me hate being like that...
Asuna
650047_17_a
Haha, not exactly. Just that I
remember doing everything I could
to get the best grades in school.
Asuna
650047_16_a
So you're saying you don't mind
losing?
Yui
650047_15_a
As long as I'm having fun here,
even if I lose, it still feels
like I'm winning...
Asuna
650047_14_a
Of course I'm competitive. Of
course I want to win. But still...
Asuna
650047_13_a
Well, I started feeling like I
wanted to actually enjoy myself
in this world.
Asuna
650047_12_a
At first, all I was concerned
about was surviving, but after I
met Kirito and everyone...
Asuna
650047_11_a
I never played a single VRMMO
until I picked up SAO.
Asuna
650047_10_a
Hmmm... That's a good question.
Asuna
650047_9_a
Then why did you refuse?
Yui
650047_8_a
And it's not like I didn't think
it was a good idea, or was afraid
it'd be cheating...
Asuna
650047_7_a
Yeah... I bet Kirito wouldn't have
hesitated to buy it off Argo.
Asuna
650047_6_a
But knowledge is just part of the
battle, right? It would have
helped a lot.
Yui
650047_5_a
That information would have given
us a slightly unfair advantage
over the other teams...
Yui
650047_4_a
I am.
Asuna
650047_3_a
Asuna
650047_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Mommy, are you sure that was the
right thing to do?
Yui
650047_1_a
...
Asuna
650045_28_a
So, Asu--ya want the info or not?
Argo
650045_27_a
W-Wow, Argo...
You really are thorough...
Asuna
650045_26_a
Sure, it kinda falls in a gray
area, they said, but then told me
it was totally maybe cool!
Argo
650045_25_a
Don't ya worry, I triple-checked
with the organizers ta make sure
sellin' it was kosher.
Argo
650045_24_a
Ha ha ha...
But...isn't this cheating?
Asuna
650045_23_a
Wow, Argo! You're a spymaster!
Yui
650045_22_a
But I got my ways, ya see, and
happened to procure that info.
Argo
650045_21_a
Normally ya don't know which
player the other team is sendin'
ta what event, right?
Argo
650045_20_a
B-But...
Yui
650045_19_a
You have access to that?!
Asuna
650045_18_a
The list of players competin' in
each event, includin' yer rival
teams!
Argo
650045_17_a
What is it?
Asuna
650045_16_a
A-ha! I got it! Ya definitely need
ta know this!
Argo
650045_15_a
Alright then... Somethin' worth
what ya told me...
Argo
650045_14_a
Nahaha, there's no changin' yer
mind once it's been made up.
Argo
650045_13_a
I'm spending the same amount of
money either way, so just tell me
something worth what I told you.
Asuna
650045_12_a
Well...
Argo
650045_11_a
I have a better idea. Why don't
we trade info for info? Since
you're here and all.
Asuna
650045_10_a
Well, at least take yer two drinks
on the house.
Argo
650045_9_a
What? I didn't realize ya wanted
so many...
Argo
650045_8_a
It's going to be expensive!
Yui
650045_7_a
Oh, you don't have to do that.
I need to buy enough for everyone
on the red team.
Asuna
650045_6_a
Here ya go! Free sports drinks,
as promised.
Argo
650045_5_a
Yep.
Asuna
650045_4_a
Yui
650045_3_a
Asuna
650045_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Ahh, I see, I see...
So that's how ya got it.
Argo
650045_1_a
I knew I could count on ya, Asu!
Argo
650043_20_a
Well, sure then!
I'm happy to help.
Asuna
650043_19_a
It's still good info ta have, even
if it's only fer reference.
Argo
650043_18_a
Nahaha, doesn't matter ta me.
After all, who's ta say they'll
never put that quest on again?
Argo
650043_17_a
I got it after finishing a
limited-time quest a while back.
Asuna
650043_16_a
Oh, I don't mind telling you at
all, but it might be a bit hard
to get that skill now...
Asuna
650043_15_a
I'd even give ya some free sports
drinks fer yer trouble.
Argo
650043_14_a
Y'know, I'd be ever so grateful
if ya'd tell me exactly how ya
got that skill.
Argo
650043_13_a
Hehe, glad I'm appreciated.
Asuna
650043_12_a
All my customers are talkin' about
that amazin' support skill ya got.
Argo
650043_11_a
I could say the same ta ya, Asu!
Yer makin' waves out there today!
Argo
650043_10_a
Ha ha ha! You're always playing an
angle, aren't you Argo?
Asuna
650043_9_a
Ya'd never believe all the info I
get just from listenin' ta people
chat while they're buyin' stuff.
Argo
650043_8_a
Nehehe, what better place fer an
info broker ta be than around
big crowds of people like this?
Argo
650043_7_a
I thought you only dealt in
information?
Yui
650043_6_a
Nahaha, ain't it obvious? I'm
helpin' ta run the food stalls!
Argo
650043_5_a
Argo! What are you doing here?
Asuna
650043_4_a
Yui
650043_3_a
Asuna
650043_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Asu!! Nice to see ya!
Argo
650043_1_a
Argo?!
Asuna
650041_18_a
Hey hey, step right up!
We got everythin' ya need!
???
650041_17_a
Excuse me, do you have any sports
drinks?
Asuna
650041_16_a
Let's go see what they have.
Asuna
650041_15_a
Ooh, they're selling drinks over
there, Mommy!
Yui
650041_14_a
Thanks, Yui.
Asuna
650041_13_a
Okay! I'll come too!
Yui
650041_12_a
That's a great idea! I'll go buy
them all something to drink!
Asuna
650041_11_a
You're right... I know! Why don't
we bring everyone some
refreshments?
Yui
650041_10_a
Too much VR can really wear you
out, after all.
Asuna
650041_9_a
I suppose. Part of me worries that
they're focusing too much of
their energy on this, though...
Asuna
650041_8_a
Mommy, your Cheer skill not only
raised the red team's strength,
but increased their morale, too!
Yui
650041_7_a
Aw, you're just saying that.
Red Team Player
650041_6_a
Hehe, you're welcome. But you're
the ones who did all the hard
work for the red team!
Asuna
650041_5_a
Thank you so much!
Red Team Player
650041_4_a
Yui
650041_3_a
Asuna
650041_2_a
bg_event_grounds
Your Cheer skill really helped
us out, Asuna!
Red Team Player
650041_1_a
Yep!
Yuuki
650038_42_a
Because I get the feeling he never
actually wanted revenge.
Only acceptance.
Leafa
650038_41_a
I suppose... Yeah, I'm going to
believe that's exactly what
this is.
Leafa
650038_40_a
Everything he never got to say,
you said for him. I bet that made
him really happy...
Yuuki
650038_39_a
Hey may be dead, but you were
there at the end. Plus you told
off that old jerk for him.
Yuuki
650038_38_a
You think so?
Leafa
650038_37_a
Hey, that's new equipment!
I bet you anything it's a gift
from that creature!
Yuuki
650038_36_a
I got some sort of item... Look.
Leafa
650038_35_a
What's what, Leafa?
Yuuki
650038_34_a
Hey... What's this?
Leafa
650038_33_a
That voice... Could it be-?
Leafa
650038_32_a
You know me not, and yet you
showed me more kindness than
any I've ever met... Thank you.
???
650038_31_a
Huh?
Yuuki
650038_30_a
Dear travelers...
???
650038_29_a
Yeah... Though I guess this is
how the story it was based off
ended too...
Leafa
650038_28_a
I guess that's the end of the
quest, but...it just doesn't feel
like things are settled.
Yuuki
650038_27_a
bg_11_road_to_coral_sunset
...
Leafa
650038_26_a
What kind of strange folk do a job
only to refuse compensation?
Blacksmith
650038_25_a
Hmph. If you don't want the money,
then just go.
Blacksmith
650038_24_a
I know that... But I still have
to get this off my chest!
Leafa
650038_23_a
Leafa, he's not listening...
There's no point...
Yuuki
650038_22_a
He ended the life that YOU gave
him! How could you have been
so blind to what he went through?
Leafa
650038_21_a
That's why he ended his own life!
To stop himself from hurting
anyone else!
Leafa
650038_20_a
All he could think about was
revenge, how he wanted to
kill people!
Leafa
650038_19_a
In the letter, he wrote about how
the hatred in his heart had grown
and grown.
Leafa
650038_18_a
We know what his parting words
were... We know he was really a
kind and gentle soul!
Leafa
650038_17_a
Leafa...
Yuuki
650038_16_a
Take your reward and shove it!
Leafa
650038_15_a
Go on. You earned it!
Blacksmith
650038_14_a
Here is your reward, as promised.
Blacksmith
650038_13_a
Ha ha, that's the best news I've
had in a long time! That failure
is finally dead!
Blacksmith
650038_12_a
bg_11_road_to_coral_sunset
I heard the monster is dead.
Blacksmith
650038_11_a
...if this is his last message, it
wouldn't make sense if we weren't
able to read it.
Leafa
650038_10_a
This looks like Old Norse...
I'll have to translate it, but...
Leafa
650038_9_a
Can you read it?
Yuuki
650038_8_a
Let's see what it says...
Leafa
650038_7_a
Look, Yuuki. I think that's
a letter.
Leafa
650038_6_a
I don't believe it...
Yuuki
650038_5_a
That is a pretty huge stake in the
middle of his chest... Did he do
this to himself...?
Leafa
650038_4_a
The creature... He's not moving.
Is he...dead?
Yuuki
650038_3_a
Yuuki
650038_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Is that him?
Leafa
650038_1_a
Yep!
Yuuki
650037_16_a
Yeah, as if.
Let's go, Yuuki!
Leafa
650037_15_a
Something about him gave me the
creeps, so I didn't go after him.
You best keep your distance too.
Townsperson
650037_14_a
Yeah, but I would've thought he'd
have gone towards the blacksmith's
house, not the mountains.
Leafa
650037_13_a
Did you hear that, Leafa? I think
we finally found a lead!
Yuuki
650037_12_a
bg_02_fountain_sunset
Yes, I saw a real ugly fellow
go into the mountains.
Townsperson
650037_11_a
Okay...
Leafa
650037_10_a
That's the only way we're going to
stop this revenge tragedy from
playing out!
Yuuki
650037_9_a
Don't lose hope yet, Leafa. We
still have to find the creature,
after all.
Yuuki
650037_8_a
But if we don't do something, that
creature's gonna end up killing
him...
Leafa
650037_7_a
I don't think the scientist-I
mean, the blacksmith-is gonna
have a sudden change of heart.
Yuuki
650037_6_a
After all, the original story
didn't end on a high note.
Yuuki
650037_5_a
I know... But we might not have
a choice.
Yuuki
650037_4_a
It's all that stupid blacksmith's
fault, but there's just no getting
him to see sense!
Leafa
650037_3_a
Yuuki
650037_2_a
bg_11_road_to_coral_sunset
Augh! I can't stand this!
Leafa
650037_1_a
O-Okay...
Yuuki
650035_25_a
Come on, Yuuki.
Leafa
650035_24_a
What are you talking about?
Blacksmith
650035_23_a
But you know this isn't going to
end well for you OR your creature!
Leafa
650035_22_a
...We'll do the job.
Leafa
650035_21_a
So? What's your decision?
Blacksmith
650035_20_a
I guess not...
Leafa
650035_19_a
Uh, Leafa, I don't think this NPC
has any sort of AI or advanced
conversational abilities.
Yuuki
650035_18_a
There are plenty of others I can
ask if you two aren't up to the
task!
Blacksmith
650035_17_a
Are you going to destroy it or
not? Make up your mind.
Blacksmith
650035_16_a
...
Blacksmith
650035_15_a
Why not try treating your creation
with a little more compassion?
Leafa
650035_14_a
We do?
Yuuki
650035_13_a
Mister Blacksmith, we have a favor
to ask!
Leafa
650035_12_a
I can see why that poor creature's
angry, being treated so coldly by
its own parent...
Leafa
650035_11_a
Honestly, it's his fault in the
first place for mistreating his
own creation...
Leafa
650035_10_a
Ugh... He hasn't gotten any less
crotchety since the last time we
spoke.
Yuuki
650035_9_a
Otherwise I'll happily give it to
someone who will be of more use!
Blacksmith
650035_8_a
You haven't defeated the monster
yet, have you? Hurry up and do
the job you've been given!
Blacksmith
650035_7_a
bg_11_road_to_coral_sunset
You again! Why have you returned?
Blacksmith
650035_6_a
Yeah. If it's revenge the creature
wants, that's where it'll go to
get it. Let's head back.
Leafa
650035_5_a
So there's no reason to run around
looking for it. We should just
wait at the blacksmith's house.
Yuuki
650035_4_a
If this is the tale this quest is
based on, then this creature we're
after must hate the blacksmith.
Yuuki
650035_3_a
Yuuki
650035_2_a
bg_03_forest1_sunset
And no one ever saw the monster-
no, the poor creature-again.
Leafa
650035_1_a
Then, his revenge against his
creator complete, the nameless
wretch vanished into the north.
Yuuki
650033_25_a
The scientist tracked him all the
way to the North Pole, but died
of exhaustion from the journey.
Yuuki
650033_24_a
So he exacted his revenge by
killing the scientist's friends
and family, one by one.
Yuuki
650033_23_a
turned him into a cruel monster,
filled with wrath and consumed
with vengeance...
Leafa
650033_22_a
the scientist abandoned him.
Then all the horrible experiences
he had at the hands of others
Leafa
650033_21_a
The creature started out so kind
and gentle, but because of his
horrifying appearance
Leafa
650033_20_a
Not exactly a happy story, is it?
Leafa
650033_19_a
Huh...
Yuuki
650033_18_a
...
Leafa
650033_17_a
...
Yuuki
650033_16_a
Yep!
Yuuki
650033_15_a
Hehe, sounds like we've got some
reading to do.
Leafa
650033_14_a
Let me look it up on an e-book
site... Aha! Found it!
Yuuki
650033_13_a
Riiight.
Yuuki
650033_12_a
Frankenstein's not really in my
wheelhouse since it's more of a
modern Gothic tale.
Leafa
650033_11_a
Well, I read plenty of myths and
legends and fantasy stuff.
Leafa
650033_10_a
What? A book you haven't read?
Leafa, I'm shocked!
Yuuki
650033_9_a
Me either, but we probably should.
I bet we'd learn something useful
from it.
Leafa
650033_8_a
You know, I don't think I've ever
actually read that book.
Yuuki
650033_7_a
Yeah, but they probably just
switched it up a bit since ALO
is a fantasy game.
Leafa
650033_6_a
That old horror novel? But that
was a mad scientist, not a mad
blacksmith.
Yuuki
650033_5_a
If he is who he says he is, then
this is probably based on the
story of Frankenstein.
Leafa
650033_4_a
Yeah! Like how that guy said he's
the one who made the monster!
Yuuki
650033_3_a
Yuuki
650033_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
Hmmm... There are some things
about this that bug me.
Leafa
650033_1_a
...
Leafa
650031_17_a
So hurry up and be done with it!
Blacksmith
650031_16_a
Yes, and what of it? You know all
you need to destroy it now.
Blacksmith
650031_15_a
Um, Mr. Frankenstein...? Did you
say that you're the one who
created this monster?
Yuuki
650031_14_a
What?
Leafa
650031_13_a
Out of all the creatures that I,
Frankenstein, have made, none have
been more of a miserable failure!
Blacksmith
650031_12_a
It's a murderous demon with the
devil's strength and a beast's
depravity!
Blacksmith
650031_11_a
What do you mean, "what kind of
monster"?!
Blacksmith
650031_10_a
Um, what kind of monster are we
dealing with? It'd help to know
the extent of the damage too.
Yuuki
650031_9_a
If you know about that, get out
there and take care of it already!
Blacksmith
650031_8_a
I don't think so. Um, hi, we came
here about a request to defeat
some monsters?
Leafa
650031_7_a
Hey, that old man isn't the
blacksmith, is he?
Yuuki
650031_6_a
Hmph... So it's you.
???
650031_5_a
Yep. I think we're gonna have to
take down some monsters for him.
Leafa
650031_4_a
We have to do something for an
eccentric blacksmith who lives on
the outskirts of the castle, right?
Yuuki
650031_3_a
Yuuki
650031_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
The place for that quest must be
that little shop over there.
Leafa
650031_1_a
Youuuuuu bet!
Yuuki
650028_25_a
Are you both ready?
Asuna
650028_24_a
Speak of the devil!
Kirito
650028_23_a
GRAAARRR!
Monster
650028_22_a
Yeah, you can say that ag
huh?!
Kirito
650028_21_a
You'd better learn to use that
item, then.
Yuuki
650028_20_a
just trying to explore becomes
a risky proposition.
Asuna
650028_19_a
Yeah. These monsters are good for
leveling up skills, but when they
get to be this powerful,
Asuna
650028_18_a
I'm thinking it might help us
combat the curse on these
Divine Objects.
Kirito
650028_17_a
They say it greatly reduces the
rate at which monsters spawn.
Kirito
650028_16_a
How so?
Asuna
650028_15_a
Oh! That reminds me, it sounds
like Liz and Silica found a really
useful item.
Kirito
650028_14_a
Heh, I've certainly got the
right partner for it!
Yuuki
650028_13_a
Ha ha, is that all? At this rate,
you'll be the main for that
technique in no time!
Kirito
650028_12_a
All I really had to do was focus
on moving once Asuna attacked
from behind!
Yuuki
650028_11_a
I'd heard quite a lot about it
myself, so I started going through
the steps in my head.
Yuuki
650028_10_a
But to pull it off while getting
attacked by all those monsters?
That's insane.
Kirito
650028_9_a
I heard Liz and Silica pulled it
off immediately too. They've just
got a special connection, I guess.
Asuna
650028_8_a
I know Yuuki's a genius, but
learning the technique that fast
has to be against the rules.
Kirito
650028_7_a
Heh heh! Man, pulling off that
technique feels great!
Yuuki
650028_6_a
S-Sorry, Kirito.
Asuna
650028_5_a
Looks like I didn't have to come
help you, after all.
Kirito
650028_4_a
Yuuki
650028_3_a
Asuna
650028_2_a
bg_10_field
Hah! What's this?
Kirito
650028_1_a
R-Right!
Asuna
650027_25_a
There's plenty more of 'em!
Keep going, keep going!
Yuuki
650027_24_a
GRAAAWR!
Monster
650027_23_a
Nice one, Asuna!
Yuuki
650027_22_a
Yuuki
650027_21_a
W-We did it?
On the first try?!
Asuna
650027_20_a
GLUGHAAAH!
Monster
650027_19_a
YAAAAHHH!
Yuuki
650027_18_a
What the
Asuna
650027_17_a
Step back, and...strike!
Asuna
650027_16_a
On it!
Yuuki
650027_15_a
Switch, Yuuki!
Asuna
650027_14_a
GRAGH?!
Monster
650027_13_a
HYAH!
Asuna
650027_12_a
GRAAAAH!
Monster
650027_11_a
Roger!
Yuuki
650027_10_a
They'll be sure to counterattack,
so be on guard the instant the
attack fails!
Asuna
650027_9_a
I don't think we'll get it on the
first try, so just keep at it!
Asuna
650027_8_a
Well then... Let's get started!
Asuna
650027_7_a
I wouldn't have it any other way!
Yuuki
650027_6_a
I've got the experience, and that
should up our chances of success!
Asuna
650027_5_a
But I'm taking the lead! You're my
partner, after all!
Asuna
650027_4_a
That's the spirit!
Yuuki
650027_3_a
Yuuki
650027_2_a
bg_10_field
Alright, you win. Let's try it.
Asuna
650027_1_a
Yuuki...!
Asuna
650025_23_a
I know, I know! But the only way
out of this jam is through it!
Yuuki
650025_22_a
But we really need to put in the
work and practice until it's
second nature!
Asuna
650025_21_a
This technique certainly makes
that a viable strategy...
Asuna
650025_20_a
I think we should pick off as many
as we can while we move.
Yuuki
650025_19_a
At this rate, we'll just be kiting
an army of monsters if we run,
and that doesn't sound safe.
Yuuki
650025_18_a
We won't reach Kirito for a while
yet, right?
Yuuki
650025_17_a
Huh?
Asuna
650025_16_a
Shouldn't we try the technique?
Just once?
Yuuki
650025_15_a
Uh, Yuuki?
Asuna
650025_14_a
...
Yuuki
650025_13_a
Urgh! There's no end to them,
Yuuki! Just run!
Asuna
650025_12_a
Geez! They're in your face the
second you step outside the
safe zone!
Yuuki
650025_11_a
bg_10_field
Gryaaaah!
Monster
650025_10_a
Yeah!
Asuna
650025_9_a
Well, he's headed our way, so
let's meet him in the middle!
Yuuki
650025_8_a
It sounds that way. It might be
faster for us to go help him!
Asuna
650025_7_a
Yikes, he's worse off than us!
He's all by himself, right?
Yuuki
650025_6_a
But... He's also being pursued by
a giant monster army?!
Asuna
650025_5_a
Oh, nice! That'll really help.
Yuuki
650025_4_a
He says he can come to us.
Asuna
650025_3_a
Yuuki
650025_2_a
bg_02_fountain
Ah, Kirito messaged me back.
Asuna
650025_1_a
Sure, no problem...
Yuuki
650023_25_a
Sorry, Yuuki, but I need to ask
Kirito if he can hold this Divine
Object for a bit.
Asuna
650023_24_a
Ahh, okay.
Yuuki
650023_23_a
Going up against that mass of
enemies every time wouldn't
be ideal, really.
Asuna
650023_22_a
But this attack takes time to
master, so we need time to talk
and strategize after each attempt.
Asuna
650023_21_a
Sure, if you just want to level
up your skills.
Asuna
650023_20_a
Ah, okay. That explains it, then.
They make for pretty good
practice, though, don't they?
Yuuki
650023_19_a
but it looks like even just one is
enough to cause chaos.
Asuna
650023_18_a
Kirito and I are trying to limit
their effects by splitting them
up across our inventories,
Asuna
650023_17_a
Exactly. We've just discovered
that they attract powerful
monsters, as I'm sure you noticed.
Asuna
650023_16_a
Divine Object? You mean those
things Alice and Eugeo are
looking for?
Yuuki
650023_15_a
No, they weren't. And they spawned
because of a Divine Object.
Asuna
650023_14_a
Asuna
650023_13_a
bg_02_fountain
Whew! Those monsters were no joke!
Yuuki
650023_12_a
Roger that!
Yuuki
650023_11_a
I can explain later! For now we
need to fend off these monsters
and get back to the safe zone!
Asuna
650023_10_a
What is it?
Yuuki
650023_9_a
Oh no... It can't be!
Asuna
650023_8_a
Me neither. And certainly not a
horde this powerful!
Asuna
650023_7_a
Weird, I haven't seen many mobs
spawn in this area before.
Yuuki
650023_6_a
What the
?! Where did that
monster come from?
Asuna
650023_5_a
Graaaagh!
Monster
650023_4_a
I was born ready!
Yuuki
650023_3_a
Yuuki
650023_2_a
bg_10_field
This looks like a good spot.
Shall we get started?
Asuna
650023_1_a
We'll definitely give it
our best shot!
Asuna
650021_19_a
Alright! I'll pick this up in the
blink of an eye, then!
Yuuki
650021_18_a
Every time I learn something new,
I send the information to Argo
so it can help others.
Asuna
650021_17_a
Yeah, that's been a huge help.
Asuna
650021_16_a
It's like a minigame of its own
that everyone's working together
to beat!
Yuuki
650021_15_a
It's cool that you're learning
more about it as more people
learn it, though!
Yuuki
650021_14_a
Wow, so everyone's figured out how
to do this already, huh? Guess I'd
better catch up!
Yuuki
650021_13_a
If one of us gets staggered from
the impact of that first strike,
it won't work.
Asuna
650021_12_a
it seems like our attacks have to
more or less match up too.
Asuna
650021_11_a
Although, based on what I've heard
from everyone who's succeeded,
Asuna
650021_10_a
It's all just a matter of whether
or not we can get the timing down.
Asuna
650021_9_a
I can't see why not. There aren't
any rules against it.
Asuna
650021_8_a
Are you even allowed to try it
with someone else?
Yuuki
650021_7_a
This wouldn't happen to be the one
you and Kirito just learned how to
do, would it?
Yuuki
650021_6_a
Yep! I think it'd be great if we
could execute it together.
Asuna
650021_5_a
So you wanna practice that new
technique of yours with me?
Yuuki
650021_4_a
Hi, Yuuki!
Asuna
650021_3_a
Asuna
650021_2_a
bg_04_field_bridge
Hey Asuna! Thanks for the message!
Yuuki
650021_1_a
Ooh, sounds nice.
And I'll hold you to that.
Kirito
650018_31_a
I'll cook up some juicy info just
fer ya. Might take a bit, but I
guarantee it'll be worth it.
Argo
650018_30_a
Nahaha! Looks like yer gettin'
a hang for the biz!
Argo
650018_29_a
Heh, so my tip's going to be for
sale, huh? Then you owe me a cut.
Kirito
650018_28_a
Thanks fer the sweet tip, kiddos.
I'll add this tidbit to the info
pile.
Argo
650018_27_a
Wow, good point, Kirito. I never
thought of it like that.
Asuna
650018_26_a
That's the idea!
Kirito
650018_25_a
Ahh, I think I getcha. Like two
streams coming together to
form a river.
Argo
650018_24_a
So rather than force our attacks
together, I let Asuna lead and
just sorta go along for the ride.
Kirito
650018_23_a
It's kind of hard to explain, but
it's kind of like weaving my
attack into Asuna's.
Kirito
650018_22_a
And that means what, exactly?
Argo
650018_21_a
Yeah, exactly. So the trick here
isn't to try to attack at the same
time, but add my attack to hers.
Kirito
650018_20_a
Avoidin' that was the whole reason
people came up with the switch in
the first place.
Argo
650018_19_a
That means rather than hittin' yer
target, ya just bump into yer
partner.
Argo
650018_18_a
Yeah, I figured that much.
Ya end up gettin' all tangled
up when ya attack.
Argo
650018_17_a
But the problem is, if you both
try to hit the same thing, you'll
just get in each other's way.
Kirito
650018_16_a
Hmm, let's see... The point is to
hit with attacks simultaneously
for a massive power boost.
Kirito
650018_15_a
So that technique just now,
there some sort of secret to
learnin' it?
Argo
650018_14_a
Really?! Thanks, Argo!
Asuna
650018_13_a
Well, I am-and with the goods too.
Argo
650018_12_a
I didn't notice you were back,
Argo.
Kirito
650018_11_a
Kirito
650018_9_a
Nahaha, and I can attest to that.
I saw everythin'.
Argo
650018_8_a
Asuna
650018_10_a
Yup! And now I'm confident that
other people can learn this
technique too! Woohoo!
Asuna
650018_7_a
This makes two times now, if we
count that fight the other day!
Kirito
650018_6_a
Yeah, you did!
Great job, Kirito!
Asuna
650018_5_a
I did it...
Kirito
650018_4_a
Yaaah!!
Asuna
650018_3_a
Asuna
650018_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Hrrraaagh!!
Kirito
650018_1_a
Hehehe, because I said so!
Asuna
650017_23_a
Why do I have to work my butt off
just to get you food info?
Kirito
650017_22_a
You bet! But it'll only be mine if
you master this technique! So back
to work!
Asuna
650017_21_a
Hmm... I suppose that is the sort
of thing you'd go for.
Kirito
650017_20_a
Apparently even Argo didn't know
offhand, so she went to find out
for me.
Asuna
650017_19_a
Okay...
Kirito
650017_18_a
There's this legendary ingredient
I've wanted for ages, so I asked
her to tell me how to get it.
Asuna
650017_17_a
She ran off to get my payment,
shouting "at that price, it's a
steal! Nahahaha!"
Asuna
650017_16_a
By the way...
Where is our devious
little info broker?
Kirito
650017_15_a
Oh, come on. You know I couldn't
do that.
Asuna
650017_14_a
You should've just picked an
outrageous price and made off
like a bandit.
Kirito
650017_13_a
Ahaha, yeah, I guess not.
Asuna
650017_12_a
Yeah, but you forced her to accept
that condition. Honestly? Not the
best business decision.
Kirito
650017_11_a
I need to prove that other people
can learn this technique before
she'll buy it from me.
Asuna
650017_10_a
Ahahaha, duh! Because Argo asked
us to, of course.
Asuna
650017_9_a
Hey, Asuna? Why are we practicing
this again?
Kirito
650017_8_a
Kirito
650017_7_a
You almost got it that time!
Asuna
650017_6_a
Awww!
Kirito
650017_5_a
Step back and...strike!
Kirito
650017_4_a
Y-Yeah, got it!
Kirito
650017_3_a
Kirito
650017_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Kirito!
Switch!
Asuna
650017_1_a
Uhh... L-Let me think...
Asuna
650015_24_a
Then it does have value! So c'mon,
stop stallin' and name a price!
Argo
650015_23_a
Yeah, that's a good way of
thinking about it.
Asuna
650015_22_a
So like a two-person cooperative
OSS? Sounds sweet.
Argo
650015_21_a
True. It's more like an OSS.
Grasp the basics and practice
it enough, and voila.
Kirito
650015_20_a
And it's nothing special, either.
You don't need superhuman
reflexes like Kirito to do it...
Asuna
650015_19_a
O-Okay... But I still feel weird
about taking money for this,
especially if no one can learn it.
Asuna
650015_18_a
She's right, Asuna. Why not
just name a price to make her
feel better?
Kirito
650015_17_a
That's fer me to decide,
Asu-after I pay ya.
Same goes fer my clients.
Argo
650015_16_a
If someone can't use it even after
they learn how, doesn't that mean
it's worthless info?
Asuna
650015_15_a
But... I don't even know if my
technique is worth enough to
sell...
Asuna
650015_14_a
Nothin' in life's free. 'Sides,
I got my pride as an info broker.
I'm payin' ya, and that's final!
Argo
650015_13_a
But really, I don't mind. I'm
happy to teach you for free.
Asuna
650015_12_a
That means I gotta pay a fair
price fer the info I get.
Argo
650015_11_a
That's not the point, Asu!
An info broker buys and sells
info. That's our job.
Argo
650015_10_a
Umm...nothing?
I don't need money.
Asuna
650015_9_a
Yer forgettin' the most important
thing! Negotiation! How much ya
chargin' me fer the info?!
Argo
650015_8_a
Huh? Why?
Asuna
650015_7_a
Hold it!
Argo
650015_6_a
Sure. You take point, and I'll be
your partner.
Kirito
650015_5_a
Yeah, sure! Do you mind helping
teach her, Kirito?
Asuna
650015_4_a
Asuna
650015_3_a
Kirito
650015_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Well, whatever.
Asu, show me yer moves?
Argo
650015_1_a
Yeah, yer right there.
Argo
650013_22_a
I can't imagine it spreading that
much if only a few people can
pull it off.
Kirito
650013_21_a
I wouldn't go that far...
But still, it's really, really
hard to master.
Kirito
650013_20_a
I'm guessin' that means most
players don't have any hope of
learnin' it.
Argo
650013_19_a
Yer jokin'! If even yer havin'
trouble learning it, that changes
things.
Argo
650013_18_a
Asuna's been trying to teach me
for a while now, and I still can't
get it.
Kirito
650013_17_a
Really?
Argo
650013_16_a
Anyway, I'm more concerned with
the fact that this technique is
ridiculously hard to learn.
Kirito
650013_15_a
Yeah yeah, save it.
Kirito
650013_14_a
That's my Asu! A decent human
being, unlike SOME people.
Argo
650013_13_a
I'm happy to explain it to anyone
who wants to learn.
Asuna
650013_12_a
Ahaha, well, I don't mind sharing.
Actually, I'm already teaching it
to all my friends.
Asuna
650013_11_a
Then again, if I did come up with
an awesome new skill, I wouldn't
just tell you for nothing.
Kirito
650013_10_a
Not really, no. But why are you
asking me? Asuna came up with it.
It's her call.
Kirito
650013_9_a
Don't tell me ya plan on keepin'
Asu's juicy new technique a
secret?
Argo
650013_8_a
Whoa whoa whoa, Kii-boy! What's
with the silent treatment?
Argo
650013_7_a
...
Kirito
650013_6_a
I'd also love it if ya could teach
me how to do it. I plan to make
a pretty penny off the info.
Argo
650013_5_a
Care to fill me in on the deets?
Argo
650013_4_a
Asuna
650013_3_a
Kirito
650013_2_a
bg_18_mountain
So anyway, I hear Asu figured out
some kinda new uber switch or
somethin'.
Argo
650013_1_a
I've known you for ages, Argo.
Your motives are clear as day
to me.
Kirito
650011_24_a
Nahahaha! Yer sharp as ever,
Kii-boy!
Argo
650011_23_a
She did?
Argo, is that true?
Asuna
650011_22_a
You came to gather info on Asuna's
new technique, right?
Kirito
650011_21_a
Oho, that right?
Well, let's hear it!
Argo
650011_20_a
Actually, never mind. I think
I know why you're here.
Kirito
650011_19_a
It has been a while, Argo.
So, how about you tell me...
Kirito
650011_18_a
Good! You look like you're doing
pretty well yourself.
Asuna
650011_17_a
Haven't seen ya around lately.
How ya two lovebirds doin'?
Argo
650011_16_a
Asuna
650011_15_a
Argo
650011_14_a
Well, if it isn't my favorite info
broker.
Kirito
650011_13_a
Nehehe... Ya look like yer havin'
trouble, Kii-boy.
???
650011_12_a
I'm pretty sure I've almost got
it down, but... Hmm...
Kirito
650011_11_a
Hey, I don't mind.
Asuna
650011_10_a
Sorry to make you spend so much
time practicing with me, Asuna...
Kirito
650011_9_a
Kirito
650011_8_a
sigh
... We messed it up again.
We're so close, too...
Asuna
650011_7_a
Whoa!
Kirito
650011_6_a
Gah!
Asuna
650011_5_a
Strike!!
Kirito
650011_4_a
You got it! First I pull back,
and then...
Kirito
650011_3_a
Kirito
650011_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Kirito!
Switch!
Asuna
650011_1_a
Yay! Thanks, Sinonon!
Asuna
640338_27_a
I'll do what I can, but don't
expect culinary miracles from me.
Sinon
640338_26_a
Hehe, you heard the boss. Do you
want to help this time, Sinonon?
Asuna
640338_25_a
There'll be no rest till it's
done!
Cook
640338_24_a
We've got our work cut out for us,
and this catch isn't going to
preserve itself!
Cook
640338_23_a
No time to stand around looking
pretty, dears!
Cook
640338_22_a
Makes sense.
Sinon
640338_21_a
That must have been the dev team's
way of giving players a hint
about what to do.
Asuna
640338_20_a
The supplies like salt, oil and
vinegar were already set up
right here.
Asuna
640338_19_a
But it really wasn't that hard,
to be honest!
Asuna
640338_18_a
Ha ha, thanks.
Asuna
640338_17_a
I guess all that level-grinding in
the kitchen paid off, right?
Sinon
640338_16_a
Great work, Asuna. But I never
would've thought you could make
that sort of food in a VRMMO.
Sinon
640338_15_a
Aye-aye, cap'n!!
Crew Members
640338_14_a
All right, back to schedule!
Full speed ahead, men!
Captain
640338_13_a
Cook...
Asuna
640338_12_a
She knows her way around a galley
after all.
Cook
640338_11_a
Don't look at me.
Thank this little lady.
Cook
640338_10_a
Preserves! Of course!
Good thinking!
Captain
640338_9_a
Cappie! Problem solved!
We'll survive the next leg of the
voyage after all!
Cook
640338_8_a
This food...
It looks like it'll last.
Cook
640338_7_a
All we need to do is preserve a
big catch of fish like this,
and our stores won't run out.
Asuna
640338_6_a
...
Cook
640338_5_a
And we preserved these in vinegar.
Asuna
640338_4_a
Sinon
640338_3_a
Captain
640338_2_a
bg_s2_20_restaurant
So! These fish have been dried,
these we pickled...
Asuna
640338_1_a
You have an idea?
Sinon
640337_36_a
Yeah. Unless...
Asuna
640337_35_a
I see... So it'll all go to waste?
Sinon
640337_34_a
Fresh fish will only last so long.
Asuna
640337_33_a
I think it's more the timing
that'll be a problem.
Asuna
640337_32_a
Why don't we just stock up on a
big catch now?
Sinon
640337_31_a
But we can still bring in some
fish around here.
Sinon
640337_30_a
Yeah...
Asuna
640337_29_a
This doesn't sound good...
Sinon
640337_28_a
What do ya expect me to do?
All we can do is sail on!
Captain
640337_27_a
We're going to run out of supplies
unless we can make port!
Cook
640337_26_a
B-But... With the stores we have
remaining...
Cook
640337_25_a
We're heading into rough seas,
so we aren't likely to catch any
fish anytime soon.
Captain
640337_24_a
Cappie...
Whatever is it?
Cook
640337_23_a
Sinon
640337_22_a
Asuna
640337_21_a
Sorry to interrupt supper, lads,
but I've got rotten news.
Captain
640337_20_a
Heh, I stand corrected.
Sinon
640337_19_a
See what I mean?
Asuna
640337_18_a
Right away!
Asuna
640337_17_a
It won't take two shakes of a
lamb's tail, will it Little Miss
Magic Hands?!
Cook
640337_16_a
Well, what are you waiting for?
Whip up more grub!
Cook
640337_15_a
That was almost a compliment!
I think.
Asuna
640337_14_a
Don't worry about it, Sinonon.
Asuna
640337_13_a
I swear, if we keep getting talked
down to, I'm gonna
Sinon
640337_12_a
You had no idea how hungry all
these big boys' tummies can get.
You didn't make nearly enough!
Cook
640337_11_a
N-Not half bad.
But not all good, either.
Cook
640337_10_a
I don't think there's enough left
over for another helping...
Asuna
640337_9_a
These pirates sure eat a lot.
Sinon
640337_8_a
Okay, okay!
P-Please, just wait your turn!
Asuna
640337_7_a
Me too!
Crew Members
640337_6_a
Hey! Cook!
Seconds!
Crew Members
640337_5_a

Asuna
640335_31_a
I'm going to run you ragged!
So, you ready?!
Cook
640335_30_a
Impressive... But time for your
trial by fire: cooking for a whole
ship's worth of very hungry boys!
Cook
640335_29_a
Hehe, it was nothing...
And I took the liberty of making
soup for an appetizer, too.
Asuna
640335_28_a
Impressive, Asuna...
Sinon
640335_27_a
Already?!
How in the seven seas
Cook
640335_26_a
Sinon
640335_25_a
Cook! We're done.
Asuna
640335_24_a
Thanks, Asuna...
I'll leave this one to you.
Sinon
640335_23_a
Anyway, don't worry, Sinonon!
I'll take care of all these!
Asuna
640335_22_a
I do remember reading that pirates
had a superstition that having
women onboard was bad luck...
Sinon
640335_21_a
Maybe it's because it's so rare
for girls to be in the galley?
Who knows, ha ha ha...
Asuna
640335_20_a
What's that weirdo's problem with
us, anyway?
Sinon
640335_19_a
And chattering doesn't gut
haddock, dears!
Cook
640335_18_a
I don't hear peeling!
Cook
640335_17_a
But what about me?
I'll just get in your way.
Sinon
640335_16_a
That's only because you've spent
ages grinding for cooking xp!
Sinon
640335_15_a
Basic tasks like peeling are a
total breeze.
Asuna
640335_14_a
Relax, Sinonon, this will be a
snap. Cooking in VRMMOs is much
simpler than in the real world.
Asuna
640335_13_a
H-Hold up, Asuna!
There's no way we can handle
all these veggies!
Sinon
640335_12_a
Right away!
Asuna
640335_11_a
Gut all these vegetables,
and peel these fish!
well, you get the idea!
Cook
640335_10_a
Fine! As a special treat, I'll let
you help with the supper prep!
Cook
640335_9_a
Heh, I guess we finished faster
than expected.
Sinon
640335_8_a
Y-You scullions are done already?
Cook
640335_7_a
Doubtful. And I'm beat. Without
a cleaning skill to speed things
up, that was killer work...
Asuna
640335_6_a
We barely scrubbed off the first
layer of grime. Do they ever
clean this place?
Sinon
640335_5_a
And...did you clean the whole
galley while you were at it? This
place is practically sparkling...
Cook
640335_4_a
My, my, my!
I don't think these plates
have ever been so clean.
Cook
640335_3_a
Sinon
640335_2_a
bg_s2_20_restaurant
Finished with the dishes, Cook!
Asuna
640335_1_a
Aye-aye!
Asuna
640333_20_a
Now hop to it!
Cook
640333_19_a
And if I hear any more complaints,
I'll have you filleted and served
for supper!
Cook
640333_18_a
Gah! It's a mountain of filthy
dishes! And ugh, look at these
moldy leftovers!
Sinon
640333_17_a
I'll start you two fillies on
dish-washing duties.
Cook
640333_16_a
It means you'd better be prepared
to follow my orders to the letter,
my wee palones!
Cook
640333_15_a
Waaait a minute... Nooo...
Really? But that means...
Sinon
640333_14_a
Ahaha... Sinonon? Let's just say
you don't need to be a woman to
wear a dress.
Asuna
640333_13_a
Psst, Asuna... What's with her
hostility towards women?
She looks pretty ladylike to me.
Sinon
640333_12_a
Sinon
640333_11_a

Cook

You two are scullions now!
So get to work!
Captain
640333_9_a
Shaddup! We're shorthanded,
and they know their way around a
galley! So stop whining!
Captain
640333_8_a
Aren't you always yappin' about
not taking any women on board,
Cappie?
Cook
640333_7_a
Hmph. I suppose.
Girls, huh?
Cook
640333_6_a
Flunkies. Figured you could use
the extra sets of hands.

Stop bellyachin' and come on
already!

I can handle myself, but I'd feel
much better with you there
keeping an eye out for me.
Asuna
640331_16_a
Th-Thanks, Sinonon.
I appreciate it.
Asuna
640331_15_a
I'm coming with.
Sinon
640331_14_a
Yeah, I'm not leaving you alone
in this den of villainy and vice,
Asuna.
Sinon
640331_13_a
We already got someone running
the galley. You'll be the help.
Captain
640331_12_a
Relax. I'm not making you cook for
the whole crew.
Captain
640331_11_a
It better be...
Sinon
640331_10_a
Ahaha... I'm sure that's just the
game picking up on my OP cooking
skills.
Asuna
640331_9_a
...
Sinon
640331_8_a
Call it a hunch, but I get the
feelin' you'd make for a fine
ship's cook. So get to the galley!
Captain

What do you need Asuna for, cap'n?

Good thing he's not here, then.
Hehe.
Liz
640328_27_a
Right! That's what I meant!
Leafa
640328_26_a
Oh yeah. I could picture him
taking laughing hysterically and
filming it for posterity.
Liz
640328_25_a
I bet he'd laugh at me if he saw
me carrying the shrine! Ha ha!
Leafa
640328_24_a
Oh, err... You see...
Leafa
640328_23_a
Why does you getting dressed up
have anything to do with Kirito?
Liz
640328_22_a
But this was awesome, too!
Plus it's not like Kirito's here
or anything.
Leafa
640328_21_a
I was gonna get dolled up in a
yukata and spend the evening
being girly and stuff...
Leafa
640328_20_a
That's great to hear.
Liz
640328_19_a
But it turned out to be lots of
fun! What an adrenaline rush!
I'm really glad I did it!
Leafa
640328_18_a
Ahaha... It was a little
intimidating being around all
those macho guys at first...
Leafa
640328_17_a
Hey! How was it?
Liz
640328_16_a
Thanks, Liz!

Leafa seems to be enjoying it,
though.
Premiere
640328_10_a
Hehe, right. I'll definitely be
careful.
Strea
640328_9_a
Maybe next time, you won't set
the strength requirement so high.
Liz
640328_8_a
Yeah. Leafa to the rescue!
Without her, I don't know how we
would've pulled this off.
Strea

Men

Just give us the word!
Men
640327_54_a
You guys get ready, too!
Agil
640327_53_a
You don't need to ask us twice!
Klein
640327_52_a
Klein, Agil! Ready on my mark!
Leafa
640327_51_a
Agil
640327_50_a
Klein

Hehe, thanks! Right...
Here goes nothing!

Premiere
640327_46_a
Your flexibility lets you handle
just about any role. That's the
balanced Sylph in you, I guess.
Liz
640327_45_a
Yeah, and you have such deep
understanding of your abilities
and potential.
Liz
640327_44_a

Strea

You are quite the problem-solver,
Leafa.
Premiere

Leafa
640327_40_a
Agil
640327_39_a
Awesome! I bet that'd work!
Klein
640327_38_a
I have a Sylph item that doubles
spell duration!
Leafa
640327_37_a
Klein
640327_36_a
Agil
640327_35_a
Wow, so double the spell's
duration. Buuuut there's a way
around that, too!
Leafa
640327_34_a
Premiere
640327_33_a

640327_32_a
They're doing one lap around the
festival grounds, so...about
thirty minutes?
Strea
640327_31_a
Klein
640327_30_a
Agil
640327_29_a
How long do we have to carry it
around?
Leafa
640327_28_a
How long does it last?
I don't want it to wear off and
make us drop the shrine.
Agil
640327_27_a
Hey, that's a great idea!
Klein
640327_26_a
I'm pretty sure I could help you
guys if I cast it on myself!
Leafa
640327_25_a
Klein
640327_24_a
Agil
640327_23_a
I know a Sylph spell that can
temporarily buff strength!
Leafa

Strea

Premiere
640327_20_a
What's wrong?
Liz
640327_19_a
Klein
640327_18_a
Agil
640327_17_a
I just thought of something!
Leafa
640327_16_a
I'm a Sylph, and I built my
character to be balanced.
Hmm... Wait a sec!
Leafa
640327_15_a
But I don't think I can match any
of these big burly guys here.
Or even Klein.
Leafa
640327_14_a
Klein
640327_13_a
Agil
640327_12_a
Huh? I mean, I do have high
strength compared to the average
player...
Leafa

What about Leafa?

Klein
640327_6_a
It was supposed to be our final
moment of glory, too!
Agil

We can't carry this shrine around
without another person.

Anyway, what's all this?
You all look really upset.
Leafa

Strea
640325_35_a
Well, glad you could join us.

Yup! I know I'm late, but I was
still hoping to catch some of
the festival.
Leafa

Strea

Leafa! You made it!
Liz
640325_30_a
Hey! What are you guys doing?
???
640325_29_a
Nope. It's hard-coded in now,
so it's too late to change it.
Strea
640325_28_a
Can't you just change the
settings, Strea?
Liz
640325_27_a
Ha ha... Whooops.
I think I made it too hard...
Strea
640325_26_a
Strea
640325_25_a

640325_24_a
I have searched all player data
in this area. No one meets the
strength requirements.
Premiere
640325_23_a
Agil
640325_22_a
Doesn't seem like it.
Klein

...
Onlookers
640325_20_a
Klein
640325_19_a
Hey! Does anyone around here have
high strength? We could really use
the help.
Agil
640325_18_a
Strea
640325_17_a
Liz
640325_16_a
I see...
Premiere
640325_15_a
Agil
640325_14_a
Yup. No workarounds. We just need
to find someone strong enough to
be our tenth.
Klein
640325_13_a
Premiere
640325_12_a
Liz
640325_11_a
It won't work. I set it so only
ten people can carry the shrine
at once.
Strea
640325_10_a
Add more than one person. If Liz
and I both join, our combined
strength should be enough.
Premiere
640325_9_a
Oh? What is it?
Liz
640325_8_a
Strea
640325_7_a
Liz
640325_6_a
I have an idea.
Premiere
640325_5_a
Huh...? Things are a bit noisy
over there. I wonder what's up?
Leafa
640325_4_a
I should look for Liz.
She said she'd be around.
Leafa
640325_3_a
Most of the events are over...
What a bummer.
Leafa
640325_2_a
bg_event_festival
Aww, man... Looks like I'm late
to the Arun festival.
Leafa
640325_1_a
...This is a problem.

No can do! I'm staff
this is a
job for you festival-goers!
Strea
640323_38_a
Klein
640323_37_a
What about you, Strea?
Gnomes have pretty high strength.
Agil
640323_36_a
Premiere
640323_35_a
Strea
640323_34_a
Hey! I'm a delicate flower,
okay! My strength isn't even that
high!
Liz
640323_33_a
Agil
640323_32_a
What about Liz? She's always
swinging those huge hammers
around.
Klein
640323_31_a
We just need one more person with
enough strength to lift it and
we're good...
Agil
640323_30_a
Agil
640323_29_a
So this is your doing, Strea!
Klein
640323_28_a
Premiere
640323_27_a
Liz
640323_26_a
Ha ha. Yeah, sorry! I guess I
got a little carried away.
Strea
640323_25_a
Wait. Weren't you the one who set
it, Strea?
Liz
640323_24_a
Premiere
640323_23_a

640323_22_a
Oh, wow... Ha ha, that requirement is insane...
Strea
640323_21_a
Agil
640323_20_a
And that number's ridiculous high.
Klein
640323_19_a
But it can only be lifted by
players that meet the strength
requirement.
Agil
640323_18_a
Klein
640323_17_a
This shrine's supposed to be
carried by ten people total.
Agil

I wonder what has transpired?
Premiere

Huh? The chanting stopped.

640321_15_a
This just isn't gonna happen!
Men
640321_14_a
S-Stop! STOP!
Men
640321_13_a
I see.
Premiere
640321_12_a
They're usually carried by men
in the real world, too.
Liz
640321_11_a
No, but it's set to be really
heavy, so it might be easier
for the muscly types.
Strea
640321_10_a
Sweaty guys? Are only men
permitted to carry this portable
shrine?
Premiere
640321_9_a
It's the festival's finale!
A bunch of sweaty guys are gonna
haul that portable shrine around!
Strea
640321_8_a
It sure is. We're going to ask
for volunteers to help carry it,
and then off we go!
Strea
640321_7_a
Me too. Is it time for the shrine?

OS, here I come!

You bet! I'm gonna play so hard
my sexy level is gonna be off

Hehe, I suppose so. And on that
note, let's keep playing it
together, okay?
Asuna
640318_21_a
Silica
640318_20_a
Interesting... So the secret to
Asuna's beauty is OS, huh?
Leafa
640318_19_a
You have a point. Working out
regularly is way more important
than occasional hardcore training.
Liz
640318_18_a
So even if I'm flat-out exhausted,
it makes me feel great, so I still
want to play more.
Asuna
640318_17_a
Liz
640318_16_a
But OS isn't a chore at all,
right? It's just so much fun
I lose track of time.
Asuna
640318_15_a
Leafa
640318_14_a
Yeah... You have to come up with
a plan and go to the gym all the
time...
Silica
640318_13_a
Workout routines and diets and
so on are usually really tough
to keep up, right?
Asuna
640318_12_a
Yeah, that's true. But that's why
I'm able to do so much of it.
It's fun, so I can play every day.
Asuna
640318_11_a
Yeah, I'm with Leafa on this one.
It's a game, not a sport...
Liz
640318_9_a
Asuna
640318_10_a
I don't think OS can constitute a
really serious workout or
anything...
Leafa
640318_8_a
But hold up, Asuna. I've seen you
play OS, and you move around a
lot...but not THAT much...
Leafa
640318_7_a
Leafa
640318_6_a
Well, unlike VRMMOs, you actually
have to move around to play OS.
It is good exercise, I guess...
Silica
640318_5_a
Yeah.
Asuna
640318_4_a
So all the running around you do
in OS is what's keeping you in
such good shape?
Liz
640318_3_a
Liz
640318_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
I've been playing a whole lot of
OS lately. I think that's helped

640317_35_a
Oh... Yeah...
So, about that...
Asuna
640317_34_a
Silica
640317_33_a
You were just about to give us
some of your top-secret beauty
tips.
Leafa
640317_32_a
So, umm... What were we talking
about again?
Asuna
640317_31_a

640317_30_a
I should be the one thanking
you guys!
Asuna
640317_29_a
Silica

Asuna, thanks for the save...
Leafa
640317_27_a
Hehehe, nice fight, girls.
Asuna
640317_26_a
Asuna
640317_25_a
You got that right. We would've
been goners without Asuna...
Liz
640317_24_a
Yeah... Asuna wasn't exaggerating.
Those things were serious business.
Leafa
640317_23_a
Leafa
640317_22_a
Phew...
That was seriously tough...
Silica
640317_21_a
G-Got it! Will do!

Asuna

Silica

W-Well, that isn't encouraging!
Just what are we supposed to do?!
Leafa
640317_16_a
They'll dominate us unless
we follow a specific strategy!
Asuna
640317_15_a
These things are seriously tough!
Asuna
640317_14_a

640317_13_a
Hold up! Be careful, okay?!
Asuna
640317_12_a
Leafa
640317_11_a
The four of us should be able to
take them out real quick!
Silica
640317_10_a
Either way, there aren't
too many of them!
Liz
640317_9_a

Tell us your secrets!
Leafa

I thought so...
Ahaha...ha...
Asuna
640315_28_a
NO! That was me grinding
my teeth in frustration!!
Liz
640315_27_a
Th-Thanks...I think?
That was a compliment, right?
Asuna
640315_26_a
That's true, but Asuna here is
DEFINITELY the most grown-up
looking right now!
Liz
640315_25_a

640315_24_a
Umm, guys? I think we're all
growing up, right? Why are
you so upset?
Asuna
640315_23_a
Leafa
640315_22_a
sniff
I'm so, so jealous...
Silica
640315_21_a
Grrr! I thought the real you
looked way more grown-up
than the virtual you!
Liz
640315_20_a
It's been several years since
then, and I'm pretty sure the
real me's grown...
Asuna
640315_19_a
That means it's closer to what I
looked like when I first started
SAO.
Asuna
640315_18_a
I based my ALO avatar off of my
SAO avatar.
Asuna
640315_17_a
Liz
640315_16_a
Huh...
Oh, I get it.
Asuna
640315_15_a
Y-You're right! And she's taller
in real life too, isn't she?!
Silica
640315_14_a
Silica
640315_13_a
...Now that you mention it, yeah.
Leafa
640315_12_a
I am?!
Asuna
640315_11_a
Compared to her ALO avatar,
Asuna here is WAY better endowed!
Liz
640315_9_a
Asuna
640315_10_a
Leafa
640315_8_a
Well, yeah.
What's weird about that?
Silica
640315_7_a
Asuna's avatar in ALO is always
wearing thin clothing and
showing some skin, right?
Liz
640315_6_a
Y-Yeah?
Asuna
640315_5_a
Now that I've given you a good
look-over, something's off about
you!

Ah! Explain what?!
Asuna
640315_3_a
Asuna

bg_event_swimming_pool
A-Asuna!! Explain!!

640315_1_a
No way...what?
Asuna
640313_28_a
Hmm... Wait a sec...
Waaaiiit a seeec!!
No way!!
Liz
640313_27_a
Liz! You JUST said we were done
with this conversation! Ugh!
Asuna
640313_26_a
So to close this conversation out,
I'd say Asuna's got us all beat on
the overall sexy meter.
Liz
640313_25_a
Oh... Yeah, hehe. I am too.
Asuna
640313_24_a
Asuna
640313_23_a
Alright, everyone, this chat's gone
a little too far, I'd say. I'm just
glad Kirito wasn't around.
Liz
640313_22_a
Leafa
640313_21_a
From my point of view, both of you
have nothing to complain about...
Silica
640313_20_a
Liz
640313_19_a
That's not true, Leafa!
You look great!
Asuna
640313_18_a
A-And I'm maybe working out a
little too much lately. I'm going
from slim to muscly...
Leafa
640313_17_a
Like, a big chest just means that
you might look super pudgy if
you don't dress right.
Leafa
640313_16_a
Silica
640313_15_a
You've gotta be all-around
attractive to be a knockout!
Leafa
640313_14_a
Liz
640313_13_a
Y-You don't?
What makes you say that?
Asuna
640313_12_a
But I don't have anything else
going for me!
Leafa
640313_11_a
I am a bit big around the bust,
I suppose... For my age, anyway...
Leafa
640313_10_a
Silica
640313_9_a
M-Me?!
Er, well... I guess...
Leafa
640313_8_a
A-And if we're talking about
curves, you've got us all beat,
Leafa...
Asuna
640313_7_a
Liz
640313_6_a
C-Come on, you guys are
exaggerating! I'm nothing
special...
Asuna
640313_5_a
Leafa
640313_4_a
Yeah... I don't think I'll ever
look that good, even when
I'm your age, Asuna...
Silica
640313_3_a
Asuna
640313_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
I'm jealous, Asuna. You got curves
in all the right places, but you're
still all slim and sexy.
Liz
640313_1_a
Liz
640311_29_a
You too, Leafa?! S-Stop, alright?
I'm getting some seriously creepy
vibes from you right now!
Asuna
640311_28_a
I can't stop staring...
Leafa
640311_27_a
Leafa
640311_26_a
I hate to say it, but I agree
with Liz. You definitely got it.
Silica
640311_25_a
Hmm... It's the swimsuit.
If you got it, flaunt it. That's
what I say. And girl, you got it.
Liz
640311_24_a
L-Liz, where did that come from?!
S-Stop, okay?
Asuna
640311_23_a
You got one killer bod, Asuna.
Killer.
Liz
640311_22_a
Wh-What? Why are you staring
at me like that?
Asuna
640311_21_a
But seriously, girl...
Daaamn...
Liz
640311_20_a
Liz
640311_19_a
Yeah!
Asuna
640311_18_a
Silica
640311_17_a
Heh, I doubt that. Anyway, let's
rest up a bit, then hit the pool
for real this time!
Leafa
640311_16_a
Liz
640311_15_a
Hey, don't worry about it.
Rain and the others did most of
the work. I just helped a little.
Asuna
640311_14_a
Leafa
640311_13_a
S-Sorry, Asuna, but we were just
having so much fun...
Silica
640311_12_a
We were rocking out at Yuna's
concert and completely didn't
notice what was going down.
Liz
640311_11_a
Hey, Asuna, you look beat.
Sorry we weren't there to help.
Liz
640311_10_a
Liz
640311_9_a
yawn
Well, the OS event battle's
over and everything. Maybe it's
time for a break...
Asuna
640311_8_a
Kirito
640311_7_a
Oh, I don't mind.
We'll be back in a few.
Sinon
640311_6_a
Are you sure?
I feel bad making you do it.
Asuna
640311_5_a
I'll keep you company, Sinon.
Kirito
640311_4_a
Asuna
640311_3_a
Kirito
640311_2_a
bg_event_swimming_pool
I'm going to go grab some drinks.
Sinon
640311_1_a
Yeah! Anytime!
Kirito
640308_36_a
Kirito
640308_35_a
And now that we know the way,
we can take you guys up to
the lookout spot, too.
Asuna
640308_34_a
Suguha
640308_33_a
So you WERE telling the
truth...
Sinon
640308_32_a
Asuna
640308_31_a
Ha ha! NOW do you guys
believe us?
Kirito
640308_30_a
Sinon
640308_29_a
Are they talking about you and Asuna...?
Suguha
640308_28_a
So if you're coming back
tomorrow, keep your eyes
peeled!
Announcer
640308_27_a
it looks like only two
players managed to make it
there tonight!
Announcer
640308_26_a
to guide you to the
very best viewing spot!
But, unfortunately,
Announcer
640308_25_a
And for all you Ordinal Scale
fans, we prepared a
special Navi-Monster
Announcer
640308_24_a
Ladies and gents!
We hope you enjoyed
the fireworks!
Announcer
640308_23_a
Kirito
640308_22_a
It really did, you guys!
Honest!
Asuna
640308_21_a
Suguha
640308_20_a
Suuuuure it did.
Sinon
640308_19_a
Asuna
640308_18_a
We were chasing a monster, but
it ended up leading us to this
secret viewing spot.
Kirito
640308_17_a
Asuna
640308_16_a
We didn't mean to! Honest!
It just sorta happened...
Kirito
640308_15_a
Sinon
640308_14_a
You two ditched us
to watch them alone?!
Suguha
640308_13_a
Sinon
640308_12_a
You did?
D-Does that mean...
Suguha
640308_11_a
It's okay! We saw them
from another spot.
Asuna
640308_9_a
Kirito
640308_10_a
Suguha
640308_8_a
You guys missed the fireworks!
Sinon
640308_7_a
Kirito
640308_6_a
We didn't mean to worry you!
Asuna
640308_5_a
Asuna
640308_4_a
Heh! Sorry about that.
Kirito
640308_3_a
Sinon
640308_2_a
bg_event_festival
There you are!
Suguha
640308_1_a
Y-Yeah, the fireworks...
Kirito
640307_21_a
The fireworks are
so beautiful...
Asuna
640307_20_a
Yeah...
Kirito
640307_19_a
It sure is.
And, best of all, it's
just the two of us...
Asuna
640307_18_a
This is an even better view
for the fireworks than we
could've ever hoped for!
Kirito
640307_17_a
This is like a reward for
being so persistent and
keeping up the chase.
Asuna
640307_16_a
It was worth all the
hassle getting up here.
Asuna
640307_15_a
Ha ha! I think you're right!
Lucky for us.
Kirito
640307_14_a
I guess that little girl
wasn't an enemy after all...
More like a Navigation Pixie.
Asuna
640307_13_a
And we've got
exclusive VIP seats!
Kirito
640307_12_a
Oh!
Look! The fireworks!
Asuna
640307_11_a
But...why?
Asuna
640307_10_a
So she was trying to lead us
here all along!
Kirito
640307_9_a
She's not hiding this time.
She just disappeared
right in front of us!
Asuna
640307_8_a
Whoa! She's vanishing?!
Kirito
640307_7_a
Ughiii, ughiii!
Monster
640307_6_a
Is this...
what she wanted us to see?
Asuna
640307_5_a
You can see for miles!
How did we end up here?
Kirito
640307_4_a
Finally, a clearing in
the trees! ...Huh? Is this
a lookout?
Asuna
640307_3_a
Asuna
640307_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
Whoa...!
Kirito
640307_1_a
Yeah!
Not if we can help it!
Asuna
640305_20_a
This time, we won't lose her!
Kirito
640305_19_a
H-Hey, wait--!
Suguha
640305_18_a
Eep...
Call you right back, Sugu!
Kirito
640305_17_a
Ugghiii!
Monster
640305_16_a
Look! I know, but--
Kirito
640305_15_a
You better hurry
back here or you'll
miss the fireworks!
Suguha
640305_14_a
M-Maaaybe...
Kirito
640305_13_a
Huh? What do you mean, "we"?
Did you and Asuna both
run off?!
Suguha
640305_12_a
S-Sorry!
We don't really know, either!
Kirito
640305_11_a
Kazutooooo!
Where the heck are you?!
Suguha
640305_10_a
Oh! Sugu's calling.
Kirito
640305_9_a
I wonder...
Kirito
640305_8_a
Could she maybe be leading us
somewhere?
Asuna
640305_7_a
She keeps turning around
to see if we're following, and
then running some more.
Kirito
640305_6_a
Yeah...
But at least she doesn't seem
antagonistic at all.
Asuna
640305_5_a
Oh, for the love of...
She keeps running further
into the woods!
Kirito
640305_4_a
Asuna
640305_3_a
Kirito
640305_2_a
bg_17_forest
Ugghiii... Ugghiiiii!
Monster
640305_1_a
See that you do!
Asuna
640303_24_a
Okay! This time, she's not
getting away!
Kirito
640303_23_a
Asuna... You're the best!
Kirito
640303_22_a
That's why I'm going with you!
Asuna
640303_21_a
And even if we did head back
to the fireworks, you wouldn't
be able to let this go.
Asuna
640303_20_a
Heh! Sure. I get it, Kirito.
You can't rest until you get
to the bottom of things.
Asuna
640303_19_a
I've never seen an enemy
like this in Ordinal Scale
before! What if we're the first?
Kirito
640303_18_a
I know it would mean missing
the fireworks, but...can
we chase after her?
Kirito
640303_17_a
Yeah!
Um, Asuna...
Kirito
640303_16_a
She's running further
away from the festival!
Asuna
640303_15_a
Hey, there she is!
...Aaand there she goes...
Asuna
640303_14_a
Ughiii?!
Monster
640303_13_a
Ooh! Where? Where?
Asuna
640303_12_a
Aha!
I see her!
Kirito
640303_11_a
I guess... 
sigh
That monster is still
gonna bug me, though...
Kirito
640303_10_a
Yeah. We should head back.
Asuna
640303_9_a
Neat!
I don't think we'll see
them from here, though.
Kirito
640303_8_a
Oh! Look at the time!
They're going to start the
fireworks soon.
Asuna
640303_7_a
Ha ha! Could be.
Kirito
640303_6_a
Maybe she was trying to
get away from the crowds?
Asuna
640303_5_a
I wonder where WE are!
This is ages from
the fairground.
Kirito
640303_4_a
I wonder where she is...
Asuna
640303_3_a
Asuna
640303_2_a
bg_17_forest
Where did she go...?
She was right
here a second ago!
Kirito
640303_1_a
Yeah! Let's go!
Asuna
640301_18_a
What the heck was that all
about...? I'm gonna figure
this out!
Kirito
640301_17_a
Ah!
She ran away.
Asuna
640301_16_a
Ugghiii!
Monster
640301_15_a
That's a little strange. She's
looking this way, but I don't
think she's going to attack...
Kirito
640301_14_a
Ugghiii...
Monster
640301_13_a
Huh? Where...?
Oh! It looks like
a little girl!
Asuna
640301_12_a
Look over there!
Is that a DBA?
Kirito
640301_11_a
What's wrong, Kirito?
Asuna
640301_10_a
We finished the event quest,
so we might as well switch
them-- Huh?
Kirito
640301_9_a
Oops! I didn't realize we
left Ordinal Scale running!
Asuna
640301_8_a
Sounds good to me!
Kirito
640301_7_a
Yeah. And, on the bright side,
we can enjoy a nice walk
together!
Asuna
640301_6_a
They must have gotten lost
in the crowd. Oh, well...
They'll turn up soon.
Kirito
640301_5_a
They were just
here a second ago...
Asuna
640301_4_a
I'm not sure!
I didn't see them leave.
Asuna
640301_3_a
Asuna
640301_2_a
bg_event_festival
...Hmm?
Asuna, where'd everybody go?
Kirito
640301_1_a
Heh heh! I guess it
all depends on the
way you look at things.
Philia
640298_24_a
Wow, that's so cool! In Japan,
we see it as a river, but,
in Finland, it's a bridge!
Silica
640298_23_a
That's what they used to
call the Milky Way in Finland.
Philia
640298_22_a
By the way, I did some reading
about the stardust bridge that
connects those two.
Philia
640298_21_a
Okay, if you're sure!
Thanks, Philia!
Silica
640298_20_a
And you gathered
lots of crystals.
Philia
640298_19_a
You should keep it, Silica!
You're the one who figured out
how to build the bridge.
Philia
640298_18_a
But, Philia...
Silica
640298_17_a
Th-Thank you very much!
We will!
Silica
640298_16_a
It was mine when I was young.
Please think of us
when you wear it!
Old Woman
640298_15_a
Oh, my. What a beautiful
piece of equipment!
Are you sure?
Silica
640298_14_a
Please accept this as
a token of our gratitude.
Old Man
640298_13_a
We didn't do much. It was your
love that was strong enough to
bring you back together again!
Silica
640298_12_a
It's all thanks to you
that my dear wife and I
can meet again in the stars.
Old Man
640298_11_a
Oh, fairy travelers, how can
we ever thank you enough?
Old Woman
640298_10_a
Y-Yeah, I know! S-Still...
sniffle
Silica
640298_9_a
Come on, Silica!
There's no need to cry!
It's a happy ending.
Philia
640298_8_a
sniff
Silica
640298_7_a
Now they really
can be together in
the stars after all!
Silica
640298_6_a
Aw!
I'm so glad that worked out...
Silica
640298_5_a
Darling...
I'm so happy to see you again!
Old Woman
640298_4_a
Philia
640298_3_a
Silica
640298_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
Ah, there's my dear!
Old Man
640298_1_a
Only one way to find out!
Let's give it a shot!
Silica
640297_17_a
So if we collect enough of
these crystals, we can build
a bridge between the stars?
Philia
640297_16_a
Silica
640297_15_a
Philia
640297_14_a
Chirp!
Pina
640297_13_a
I tried to feed one
to Pina, but she wouldn't
touch it at all.
Silica
640297_12_a
called a Stardust Crystal
when you beat it!
Silica
640297_11_a
Hey, I know!
There's a monster in this
area that drops an item
Silica
640297_10_a
A bridge of stardust, huh?
Silica
640297_9_a
It told of a bridge of
stardust that could
reach across the sky.
Old Woman
640297_8_a
Back on earth, there used
to be a legend...
Old Woman
640297_7_a
If only there were a way
to get across the night sky
without flying...
Silica
640297_6_a
And we can't exactly
pick up NPCs and drag
them closer together.
Silica
640297_5_a
We went to all this trouble
to find her, but, here she is,
so far away!
Philia
640297_4_a
Oh, dear... To think of my
poor husband so far away
across this dark sky...!
Old Woman
640297_3_a
Philia
640297_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
...I'm sorry, ma'am.
Silica
640297_1_a
Leave it to us. It's easy for
us to fly around, so we're
sure to find her.
Philia
640295_26_a
Sure!
Of course we will!
Silica
640295_25_a
Travelers, if it's not too
much, could you help this old
man find his dear wife's star?
Old Man
640295_24_a
What if she's somewhere
far away?
Philia
640295_23_a
Her star must be somewhere
up here, then. But I haven't
seen anything like that yet.
Old Man
640295_22_a
Y-Yes, she has...
Silica
640295_21_a
Philia
640295_20_a
Silica
640295_19_a
Oh! Don't tell me she's
already passed on, too?
Old Man
640295_18_a
Well, you see...
The thing is...
Silica
640295_17_a
Please tell her I'm
waiting on this side.
Old Man
640295_16_a
If I could ask a favor...
Please take a message
to my wife.
Old Man
640295_15_a
Of course, fairies are
free to come and go
here as they please.
Old Man
640295_14_a
Oh, are those wings...?
I see! You two were
fairies all along, eh?
Old Man
640295_13_a
Uh...n-no,
not really. We're--
Silica
640295_12_a
I take it you're
dead as well?
Old Man
640295_11_a
I'm so glad we found him!
Philia
640295_10_a
Aha!
There's the old man!
Silica
640295_9_a
Philia
640295_8_a
Silica
640295_7_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
Ah, it's you two girls!
Old Man
640295_6_a
Y-Yeah! I'm sure of it!
Silica
640295_5_a
Their stars must be
up there somewhere...
Let's find them!
Philia
640295_4_a
But the legend says they
live on in the night sky.
Philia
640295_3_a
Philia
640295_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
So the old man passed away,
and his wife followed,
just like she predicted.
Silica
640295_1_a
I wonder...
Philia
640293_23_a
Oh, you're right.
So even this couple will
be split up like that?
Silica
640293_22_a
So how does that work
out in this story?
Philia
640293_21_a
Isn't that the focus of the
Tanabata tale? Orihime and
Hikoboshi as stars, separated?
Philia
640293_20_a
Huh?
What do you mean, Philia?
Silica
640293_19_a
Yeah.
But...if they become stars,
they don't get to stay
together, do they?
Philia
640293_18_a
Wow! That's so romantic!
Silica
640293_17_a
Legend has it that
they shine down on us
from heaven forever.
Old Woman
640293_16_a
Philia
640293_15_a
Silica
640293_14_a
In this land, we say
that happy lovers live
on as stars in the sky.
Old Woman
640293_13_a
Yes, thank you. If you're
sure we're not intruding...
Philia
640293_12_a
Oh! Thank you for
your hospitality.
Silica
640293_11_a
We are not rich, but we can
offer you meals and beds.
Old Woman
640293_10_a
Yes, dear girls.
Take shelter in our
humble home if you wish.
Old Woman
640293_9_a
Hello, travelers.
Let us care for you.
Old Man
640293_8_a
Well, they're Finland's
version of Orihime and
Hikoboshi, I guess.
Silica
640293_7_a
That's Orihime and Hikoboshi?
Not exactly what I picture
for "star-crossed lovers."
Philia
640293_6_a
Huh?
An old couple?
Silica
640293_5_a
When you go, I shall follow.
Old Woman
640293_4_a
Philia
640293_3_a
Silica
640293_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
I'm not long
for this world.
Old Man
640293_1_a
Yay!
Thanks for coming along!
Silica
640291_18_a
That sounds interesting. And
it kinda fits with the ALO
world. Let's give it a try!
Philia
640291_17_a
Finland?! Wow! I never knew there
was a Nordic version of Tanabata!
Philia
640291_16_a
I was thinking...
How about the Finland one?
Silica
640291_15_a
I don't see why not.
Which country do
you want to try?
Philia
640291_14_a
So what do you say
we try this one
together, you and me?
Silica
640291_13_a
It looks like Kirito
and the others have
already taken it on.
Silica
640291_12_a
Heh heh.
Well, here's the thing...
Silica
640291_11_a
Cool.
So you're thinking of taking
this new quest on, are you?
Philia
640291_10_a
but in this side quest,
we see how they celebrate
Tanabata in other cultures.
Silica
640291_9_a
The main quest was all about
the Tanabata myth we have in Japan,
Silica
640291_8_a
Yeah, I guess it is.
The concept of this new quest
sounds pretty neat, too.
Silica
640291_7_a
So it's like something you
unlock after you finish
the main quest?
Philia
640291_6_a
Well, we just got a prompt
for a new side quest.
Silica
640291_5_a
We cleared that Tanabata Quest
with Kirito and the others,
right?
Silica
640291_4_a
What is it, Silica?
Philia
640291_3_a
Philia
640291_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hey, Philia? Philiaaa!
Silica
640291_1_a
Ha ha! We'll see about that!
Yuuki
640288_22_a
I'll stick to the classic method.
Bet I get a bigger catch than you!
Kirito
640288_21_a
Hehe! Oh yeah...
Yuuki
640288_20_a
Wait a sec. Didn't you just say
you were tired of swimming?
Kirito
640288_19_a
Come try it with me, Kirito!
It'll be fun!
Yuuki
640288_18_a
Right... No fish is getting away
from a high-speed attack like
that...
Kirito
640288_17_a
We got fish for dinner!
Yuuki
640288_16_a
So I gave 'em a taste of my famous
eleven-hit sword skill, and bam!
Yuuki
640288_15_a
But I thought they'd all swim away
if I tried to reach out and grab
one...
Yuuki
640288_14_a
Sure enough, I found lots
of fish hiding in there!
Yuuki
640288_13_a
...Then what happened?
Kirito
640288_12_a
I figured they were hiding, so I
used my Imp ability to see in the
dark to peek between the rocks.
Yuuki
640288_11_a
Well, after I dived in, I couldn't
see all the fish that were there
before.
Yuuki
640288_10_a
So how in the world did
you catch these?
Kirito
640288_9_a
This area isn't set up for anything
other than fishing with rods!
Kirito
640288_8_a
Wait, Yuuki! Those fish came
from around here, right?
Kirito
640288_7_a
Plenty where they came from.
I'm going back for more.
Yuuki
640288_6_a
I didn't know they came
so close to the shore!
Kirito
640288_5_a
That looks like...
a sea bream and a bass...
Kirito
640288_4_a
Wh-What?!
Seriously?! Wow...
Kirito
640288_3_a
Kirito
640288_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Kirito!
See!
I caught TWO!
Yuuki
640288_1_a
As long as she's having fun...
Kirito
640287_19_a
...Aaand off she goes.
Oh well...
Kirito
640287_18_a
Here, fishy-fishies!
Yuuki
640287_17_a
This fishing area was probably
designed for fishing from here
up on the rocks.
Kirito
640287_16_a
I don't think that's gonna work...
Kirito
640287_15_a
I'm gonna catch 'em
with my bare hands!
Yuuki
640287_14_a
Grrrr!! I can't take it anymore!
Yuuki
640287_13_a
Well, there's nothing for
them to eat...
Kirito
640287_12_a
There were tons of them gathered
there before, but now they're all
gone!
Yuuki
640287_11_a
Maybe it's because your skill
level is still so low...
Kirito
640287_10_a
So...I lost?
Yuuki
640287_9_a
N-Noooooo!!
They ate all my bait!
Yuuki
640287_8_a
Huh?
What is it?
Yuuki
640287_7_a
Oh!
Kirito
640287_6_a
Ungh... Maybe I'm just not
cut out for fishing...
Yuuki
640287_5_a
Ha ha, that's fishing for you: an
endurance game on both sides.
Kirito
640287_4_a
They're right there too!
Yuuki
640287_3_a
Kirito
640287_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Why aren't they taking the bait...?
Yuuki
640287_1_a
O-Okay, got it...
Yuuki
640285_23_a
Try not to make a sound...
Kirito
640285_22_a
That's it. Just sit tight and
wait a little.
Kirito
640285_21_a
Whoa, cool! So now I just let
'em take it?
Yuuki
640285_20_a
They look pretty interested
in your bait.
Kirito
640285_19_a
Fish are starting
to gather around it.
Kirito
640285_18_a
Hm?
Yuuki
640285_17_a
Hey, look at the
end of the line!
Kirito
640285_16_a
H-Hey, I can do it!
Just you watch!
Yuuki
640285_15_a
Ha ha! Sitting still and being
quiet isn't exactly your strong
suit, huh?
Kirito
640285_14_a
Five WHOLE minutes?!
Yuuki
640285_13_a
I bet you'll get a bite in...
hmm, maybe five minutes...
Kirito
640285_12_a
Well, yeah... But let's just
be patient a little longer.
Kirito
640285_11_a
You'd think they'd make it
easier in a VRMMO...
Yuuki
640285_10_a
Things like fancy rods and
lures and bait. There's a lot
of equipment for it.
Kirito
640285_9_a
They have lots of tricks for
making the fish easier to catch.
Kirito
640285_8_a
But on TV they always get a bite
straight away! What gives?
Yuuki
640285_7_a
It hasn't even been a minute yet.
Kirito
640285_6_a
Come on. We're gonna need to
wait longer than that.
Kirito
640285_5_a
Not even a nibble...
Yuuki
640285_4_a
...
Kirito
640285_3_a
Kirito
640285_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Mmmm...
Yuuki
640285_1_a
Yay!
Yuuki
640283_14_a
A-Ah, no! I just happened to
come across it before, is all...
Now, come on! Let's fish!
Kirito
640283_13_a
Kirito...did you go to all the
trouble of finding this place
for me?
Yuuki
640283_12_a
Glad to hear it! Thanks, Kirito!
Yuuki
640283_11_a
I'm sure you'll do great, Yuuki!
Kirito
640283_10_a
That's why it's a good spot!
Even low-level players can
get rare fish here.
Kirito
640283_9_a
Maybe I won't catch any...
Yuuki
640283_8_a
Gotcha... Still, it's my first time
and I've got zero experience.
Yuuki
640283_7_a
That's about all there is to it.
Kirito
640283_6_a
The time limit and types of fish
you can catch depends on your
skill level and on the fishing spot.
Kirito
640283_5_a
You just equip the fishing gear,
cast out a line, and wait.
Kirito
640283_4_a
Aye aye, Captain Kirito!
Now what do we do?
Yuuki
640283_3_a
Yuuki
640283_2_a
bg_event_seashore
This spot looks good!
Kirito
640283_1_a
Yep! I'm gonna work
my beginner's luck!
Yuuki
640281_17_a
Sure! We'll come
back with a feast!
Kirito
640281_16_a
Hehe, nothing... But if you're
going fishing, can I count on
you to catch dinner?
Asuna
640281_15_a
What's so funny, Asuna?
Yuuki
640281_14_a
Hee hee...
Asuna
640281_13_a
Really? Neat!
Yuuki
640281_12_a
I had a great teacher.
Kirito
640281_11_a
I'll take you, Yuuki! I'm pretty
good at fishing in VRMMOs.
Kirito
640281_10_a
Fishing, eh...? I've never done
that! I kinda wanna try now...
Yuuki
640281_9_a
Rock fishing, maybe?
Kirito
640281_8_a
Hehe, sorry... I guess the only
thing you two didn't get around
to was...
Kirito
640281_7_a
I'm impressed you are!
All you did was sit in the tent
staring at your HoloWindow.
Yuuki
640281_6_a
I'm impressed you're
not tired, Yuuki.
Kirito
640281_5_a
Ha ha, yeah... I feel like we
covered all the bases for a
day at the beach.
Asuna
640281_4_a
Kirito
640281_3_a
Asuna
640281_2_a
bg_event_seashore
What a great day! Lots of fun,
lots of swimming, 10/10! Would
do again!
Yuuki
640281_1_a
Yeah!
Kirito
6402708_22_a
Anyway, I feel great! We should
join them for the celebration
at the Dicey Cafe!
Asuna
6402708_21_a
I see.
Kirito
6402708_20_a
where I'm depending on you for
everything. So, I knew I had to
do it by myself.
Asuna
6402708_19_a
But I felt like if I gave the
reins to you, it'd be just like
before,
Asuna
6402708_18_a
No, it was really nice.
Asuna
6402708_17_a
N-No prob... I actually felt kind
of bad for butting in, though.
Sorry about that.
Kirito
6402708_16_a
Aww. And thanks for trying to
help me out during the strategy
meeting.
Asuna
6402708_15_a
I'm really proud of you.
Kirito
6402708_14_a
You're even stronger than when
you were the Lightning Flash.
Kirito
6402708_13_a
Okay!
Asuna
6402708_12_a
Heh, everyone seems so happy.
Kirito
6402708_11_a
Sounds great!
Player H
6402708_10_a
Let's go out to celebrate and
brag about it on the forums!
Player G
6402708_9_a
Ahhhh. It feels so good not
having to sacrifice anyone.
Player F
6402708_8_a
That's not true. Everyone gave
it everything they had, and that's
exactly why we succeeded.
Asuna
6402708_7_a
We would've been toast without
you as our leader...
Player F
6402708_6_a
That was some amazing direction!
Player G
6402708_5_a
Thanks, Asuna! You're the whole
reason we pulled it off!
Player H
6402708_4_a
Without sacrificing a single
NPC either!
Kirito
6402708_3_a
Kirito
6402708_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Yes! We beat the quest!
Asuna
6402708_1_a
...
Kirito
6402707_39_a
Thanks, guys! Let's do it!
Asuna
6402707_38_a
Well, let's give it a shot!
Sounds like a load of fun!
Player F
6402707_37_a
You guys...
Asuna
6402707_36_a
And this girl's famous for
directing battles. I'm starting
to think it's possible...
Player H
6402707_35_a
Not to mention it'd feel amazing
as a gamer to be able to do
something no one else could.
Player G
6402707_34_a
I mean, I get your point. Even
if they are just NPCs, sacrificing
someone just feels wrong...
Player F
6402707_33_a
...And I think that the strategy
I just described has the best
chance of pulling that off.
Asuna
6402707_32_a
There has to be a way to beat this
without the need for compromise.
Asuna
6402707_31_a
I just don't believe that
sacrificing NPCs is the best
way to go about this.
Asuna
6402707_30_a
Yes, following the currently
accepted strategy would be
easier and less risky.
Asuna
6402707_29_a
...
Asuna
6402707_28_a
No, Kirito. I can do this.
Asuna
6402707_27_a
Listen, guys...
Kirito
6402707_26_a
Asuna...
Kirito
6402707_25_a
Well...
Asuna
6402707_24_a
So why aren't we doing that?
Player H
6402707_23_a
Yeah. And, even then,
it's crazy hard.
Player G
6402707_22_a
Everyone's saying it's impossible
to beat this quest without using
the NPCs as a shield.
Player F
6402707_21_a
Huh?
Asuna
6402707_20_a
Yeah. Do we really have to do all
that? Seems like a lot of work
for nothing.
Player F
6402707_19_a
Does anyone have any questions?
Asuna
6402707_18_a
We'll need impeccable teamwork
to pull this off.
Asuna
6402707_17_a
Kirito
6402707_16_a
bg_os_town_2
...And that's the strategy.
Asuna
6402707_15_a
I'll help in any way I can.
Kirito
6402707_14_a
I know. But this time I want to
find a way to both save the NPCs
and beat the bad guys.
Asuna
6402707_13_a
We might have had our differences
back then, but I never thought
you were wrong.
Kirito
6402707_12_a
Asuna, don't feel so bad. This
is a completely different
situation.
Kirito
6402707_11_a
But I've changed since then.
You'll see.
Asuna
6402707_10_a
I said we should sacrifice the
NPCs if it meant protecting the
players.
Asuna
6402707_9_a
Back then, as the vice commander
of the Knights of the Blood Oath,
Asuna
6402707_8_a
...Yeah.
Kirito
6402707_7_a
I'll be okay. I bet it brought
back a lot of SAO memories
for you too, Kirito...
Asuna
6402707_6_a
Y-Yeah, a little.
Asuna
6402707_5_a
Asuna... Are you still thinking
about what Sinon just told us?
Kirito
6402707_4_a
...
Asuna
6402707_3_a
Asuna
6402707_2_a
bg_os_town_1
...
Kirito
6402707_1_a
What?!
Asuna
6402705_20_a
In fact, you might have to
sacrifice some of them in order
to defeat your enemies.
Sinon
6402705_19_a
That's not all... They're saying
it's almost impossible to fully
protect the NPCs.
Sinon
6402705_18_a
That type of multitasking is
always hard to pull off.
Kirito
6402705_17_a
That DOES sound difficult.
Kirito
6402705_16_a
...!
Asuna
6402705_15_a
You don't just have to fight
monsters, but you have to do it
while protecting NPCs that lack AI.
Sinon
6402705_14_a
What kind of a quest is it?
Kirito
6402705_13_a
Everyone's grumbling about it.
Sinon
6402705_12_a
Anyway, this new quest that just
got released is apparently
really tough.
Sinon
6402705_11_a
Ah, I see.
Asuna
6402705_10_a
They've done everything there is
to do in this game, so the devs
are adding new content.
Kirito
6402705_9_a
Hmm...
Asuna
6402705_8_a
The massive student player base
has a lot more time to play than
the adult players, after all.
Sinon
6402705_7_a
I heard the devs are going to
release a bunch of new quests
to keep up with demand.
Sinon
6402705_6_a
What about it?
Kirito
6402705_5_a
Yeah.
Asuna
6402705_4_a
Kirito
6402705_3_a
Asuna
6402705_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Do you remember when you said
that this game got really popular
with younger people?
Sinon
6402705_1_a
Yeah. Thanks...
Asuna
6402703_17_a
You've changed for the better.
I just meant that you haven't
lost any of your good qualities.
Kirito
6402703_16_a
Sorry... Of course you are.
Kirito
6402703_15_a
I AM different from when I was
the Lightning Flash...right?
Asuna
6402703_14_a
Kirito...
Asuna
6402703_13_a
Anyway, you haven't changed
at all, Asuna. You're still so
observant, and passionate, and...
Kirito
6402703_12_a
Ha ha. I have no idea who you
could be talking about.
Kirito
6402703_11_a
Unfortunately, I can't just go
around hiding like SOMEONE
I know.
Asuna
6402703_10_a
Heh, must be hard being that
popular.
Kirito
6402703_9_a
Okay...
Asuna
6402703_8_a
Aw, that's disappointing. Then
how about just when our schedules
match up?
Player D
6402703_7_a
I'm flattered, but I don't think
I can. I'm a student, so I can
only play in my spare time.
Asuna
6402703_6_a
You're famous on the OS strategy
forums, you know!
Player E
6402703_5_a
Great idea. I bet we could win
any boss battle with you in
charge!
Player E
6402703_4_a
Kirito
6402703_3_a
Asuna
6402703_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Hey. If you don't mind, would
you be the commander for our
group from now on?
Player D
6402703_1_a
Hehe, thanks.
Asuna
640271_20_a
unless there's someone like you
leading the charge.
Kirito
640271_19_a
Boss battles are especially hairy,
Kirito
640271_18_a
ARMMOs require even more teamwork
than VRMMOs.
Kirito
640271_17_a
I meant that as a compliment.
Kirito
640271_16_a
Argh! Not you too, Kirito.
Asuna
640271_15_a
Looks like someone's popular.
It's almost like the legendary
Lightning Flash is back.
Kirito
640271_14_a
...
Kirito
640271_13_a
Hehe, it was my pleasure.
Asuna
640271_12_a
I agree. I'd like you to lead
more battles like that.
Player B
640271_11_a
Right on! Well, I hope I see
you around so we can play
again. You're a huge asset.
Player A
640271_10_a
I was the vice commander of my
guild in this MMO I used to play.
That's where I got the experience...
Asuna
640271_9_a
Kirito
640271_8_a
Ha ha... Thanks.
Asuna
640271_7_a
You're like a general. Where'd
you learn to direct battles
like that?
Player C
640271_6_a
Yeah. So you're the young,
cute shot-caller everyone's
been talking about.
Player B
640271_5_a
Kirito
640271_4_a_2
Asuna
640271_4_a_1
Man, that was an incredible
attack!
Player A
640271_4_a
Roger that!
Players
640271_3_a
You'll know when the color
changes! Then, I want you all to
attack it together from behind!
Asuna
640271_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Attackers, wait on the sidelines
until the bullets hit the enemy's
horn!
Asuna
640271_1_a
Yes. Thank you!
Castor
640268_25_a
Of course!
Pollux
640268_24_a
Don't worry about it! Just
remember to "get along," okay?
Yuuki
640268_23_a
We really owe you
a debt of gratitude...
Castor
640268_22_a
We won't forget what you taught
us, for as long as we live.
Pollux
640268_21_a
You helped us to see past our
pride and realize what truly
matters.
Pollux
640268_20_a
Thank you, fairies.
Pollux
640268_19_a
Aww, you're making me blush!
Yuuki
640268_18_a
Engaging them in a physical fight
is something I never would have
come up with.
Sinon
640268_17_a
I was worried about what
might happen at first, but I
never lost faith in you, Yuuki.
Sinon
640268_16_a
You really did.
Sinon
640268_15_a
I did it, Sinon!
I was able to convince them!
Yuuki
640268_14_a
Woohoo...!
Yuuki
640268_13_a
Yes... Yes! Absolutely!
Pollux
640268_12_a
We don't have to be gods as long
as we have each other.
Castor
640268_11_a
...!
Pollux
640268_10_a
Pollux... Would you give me half
of your divinity? If you don't
have any objections, that is.
Castor
640268_9_a
Yes... Maybe you're right.
Pollux
640268_8_a
What good is being divine without
my brother by my side?
Castor
640268_7_a
However, I do think we should
take into consideration what
they have said.
Castor
640268_6_a
Brother...
Pollux
640268_5_a
We lost to a fairy...!
Castor
640268_4_a
H-How could this be...?
Pollux
640268_3_a
Sinon
640268_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
I won! Yaaaay!
Yuuki
640268_1_a
Yuuki... I'm starting to think
you just wanted a fight...
Sinon
640267_33_a
Here we gooooo!
Yuuki
640267_32_a
Yes! I've been itching to test
out my skills on deities!
Yuuki
640267_31_a
Ah, that's the reaction we've
been looking for!
Sinon
640267_30_a
Ready, brother!
Pollux
640267_29_a
Let's go, Pollux! It's time to
show them our divine strength!
Castor
640267_28_a
Very well...
We accept your challenge!
Castor
640267_27_a
Fool! I may not be immortal,
but I would never lose to a
fairy like you!
Castor
640267_26_a
So bet your godly identities on
this fight. If you lose, you have
to give up your godhood!
Yuuki
640267_25_a
Yeah! Being gods, you should be
a lot more powerful than I am.
Yuuki
640267_24_a
A fight, you say...?
Pollux
640267_23_a
Hey, guys! I challenge both of
you to a fight!
Yuuki
640267_22_a
Hmm... I got it!
Yuuki
640267_21_a
Maybe you have to think of
something along those lines.
Sinon
640267_20_a
Well, their identities as gods
must be important to them too.
Sinon
640267_19_a
They have each other. What
more could they want?
Yuuki
640267_18_a
I just don't get it.
Yuuki
640267_17_a
sigh
Yuuki
640267_16_a
You're getting them to react,
but I guess you're not using the
right words.
Sinon
640267_15_a
That wasn't it either.
Yuuki
640267_14_a
But we were born as children of
the gods. There's no other way...
Pollux
640267_13_a
So you don't want us...
to sacrifice ourselves...?
Pollux
640267_12_a
Sacrificing yourselves for the
other isn't the answer!
Yuuki
640267_11_a
I guess that wasn't it.
Sinon
640267_10_a
Wha
?! B-But
Yuuki
640267_9_a
Brothers should get along?!
Why don't you keep your damn
opinions to yourself!
Castor
640267_8_a
Brothers should get along!
Yuuki
640267_7_a
Alright. Here it goes...
Yuuki
640267_6_a
At least, that's how these
things usually go.
Sinon
640267_5_a
but you'll need to use simple
keywords to get them to react
properly.
Sinon
640267_4_a
I think you were saying the
right kind of thing,
Sinon
640267_3_a
Sinon
640267_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Do you have any suggestions on
phrasing?
Yuuki
640267_1_a
I guess I did get a little
carried away...
Yuuki
640265_21_a
Huh? Oh...ha ha. Now that you
mention it, yeah...
Yuuki
640265_20_a
but don't you think it's a bit
too complex for NPCs to
understand?
Sinon
640265_19_a
Yuuki, I loved what
you had to say,
Sinon
640265_18_a
...
Castor
640265_17_a
...
Pollux
640265_16_a
Isn't that what really matters?
Yuuki
640265_15_a
I can see that you both care
for each other...
Yuuki
640265_14_a
Who cares if you're mortal or
divine?
Yuuki
640265_13_a
even if it means you're banished
from the realm of the gods.
Yuuki
640265_12_a
I'd think it'd be worse to live
out the rest of your days
without your brother,
Yuuki
640265_11_a
...
Sinon
640265_10_a
Hold on. Would it really be as
tough as you say?
Yuuki
640265_9_a
That's why I'm saying you don't
have to do it!
Castor
640265_8_a
And that would be a hard
life to live.
Pollux
640265_7_a
The gods wouldn't accept either
of us as their own...
Pollux
640265_6_a
I believe it's possible, but
then we'd both be half god
and half human.
Pollux
640265_5_a
Just half of my divinity?
Pollux
640265_4_a
Can't you give him just half
of your divinity instead of
all of it?
Yuuki
640265_3_a
Sinon
640265_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Hey, Pollux.
Yuuki
640265_1_a
I have an idea...
Yuuki
640263_26_a
Right. But based on what we
just heard, it seems he's trying
to give ALL of it away.
Sinon
640263_25_a
In the original story, he's
supposed to give away only
half of his power.
Yuuki
640263_24_a
Huh? Yeah, I guess so.
Yuuki
640263_23_a
Hey, Yuuki. This is a bit
different from the myth,
don't you think?
Sinon
640263_22_a
...
Yuuki
640263_21_a
I couldn't go on living knowing
that it was at the expense of
your life!
Castor
640263_20_a
Don't be stupid! If you did that,
you'd become a mortal!
Castor
640263_19_a
so I'd just like to give it
back to him.
Pollux
640263_18_a
I believe this was due to me
taking all of his divinity
in our mother's womb,
Pollux
640263_17_a
...!
Yuuki
640263_16_a
...Which means his lifespan is
very short.
Pollux
640263_15_a
However, my brother was born
a mortal...
Pollux
640263_14_a
Long story short, we were born
as children of the gods.
Pollux
640263_13_a
I will do no such thing.
I want you to live, brother...
Pollux
640263_12_a
Shut up, Pollux!
Castor
640263_11_a
Won't you help me knock some
sense into my older brother,
Castor?
Pollux
640263_10_a
Well, if it isn't a pair of
traveling fairies! Greetings,
my name is Pollux.
???
640263_9_a
What's going on here?
Yuuki
640263_8_a
Ah, you might be onto something.
Let's go talk to them.
Yuuki
640263_7_a
I bet they're the twins we were
just talking about.
Sinon
640263_6_a
Hm? What are those two
fighting about?
Yuuki
640263_5_a
Do as I say! You deserve
to live as a god!
???
640263_4_a
Sinon
640263_3_a
Yuuki
640263_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
No, brother! You can't!
???
640263_1_a
Yeah...
Sinon
640261_19_a
So they lived their lives, relying
on each other. That's kind of
beautiful, don't you think?
Yuuki
640261_18_a
Wow...
Yuuki
640261_17_a
in the divine realm and the
other half in the human.
Sinon
640261_16_a
They both became half god and
half human, and thus lived half
of their lives
Sinon
640261_15_a
Really?
Then what happened to them?
Yuuki
640261_14_a
I believe the divine twin ended
up sharing his immortality with
the human twin.
Sinon
640261_13_a
Gemini, huh... Twins born to
gods, with one born human...
Sinon
640261_12_a
I'm a Gemini.
Yuuki
640261_11_a
What is your sign, anyway?
Sinon
640261_10_a
Got it.
Yuuki
640261_9_a
I think the quests are different
for each sign, so don't expect
too much from me.
Sinon
640261_8_a
I did beat one, but it was for
the Leo sign.
Sinon
640261_7_a
who's already experienced the
Thule quests.
Yuuki
640261_6_a
Yep. Besides, I'd rather have
the help of someone
Yuuki
640261_5_a
Well, Asuna, Kirito, and the
Sleeping Knights are all too
busy today, aren't they?
Sinon
640261_4_a
Sinon, thanks for agreeing to
come with me today.
Yuuki
640261_3_a
Yuuki
640261_2_a
bg_event_seashore
There you are, Yuuki.
Sinon
640261_1_a
Oh, thank God...
Err, I mean...thanks
for understanding.
Kirito
640258_22_a
Let's cross that bridge
when we get to it.
Asuna
640258_21_a
Hehe! Say no more.
Anyway, Mom seems
pretty happy for now.
Asuna
640258_20_a
Huh...?!
Err, can I maybe take
a rain-check on that?
Kirito
640258_19_a
Well! With that out of the way,
when do you want to meet Mom
for real?
Asuna
640258_18_a
Hehe! I'm just kidding!
Asuna
640258_17_a
Ack, sorry! I just thought you
weren't feeling well because
we were fighting zombies...
Kirito
640258_16_a
I am a bit disappointed that you
never realized that it wasn't me,
though...
Asuna
640258_15_a
Sh-She did? Phew...
Well, that's good to know.
Kirito
640258_14_a
She said you seem to
really care about me.
Asuna
640258_13_a
More or less... But she only had
good things to say about you.
Asuna
640258_12_a
So in other words, she snuck in
to conduct covert surveillance
to see what I'm like?
Kirito
640258_11_a
That's just how much she's been
going on about meeting you lately.
Asuna
640258_10_a
I'm really sorry! Mom made me
let her use my AmuSphere...
Asuna
640258_9_a
Why didn't I notice...?!
Kirito
640258_8_a
Asuna's mom took her place and
used her avatar to dive in!
Kirito
640258_7_a
On the last quest I went
with Klein and Asuna...
Kirito
640258_6_a
Daddy! What happened?
Why are you yelling?
Yui
640258_5_a
I'm sorry, Kirito...
Asuna
640258_4_a
Yui
640258_3_a
Asuna
640258_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
WHAAAT?!
Kirito
640258_1_a
Asuna, wait...!
Kirito
640257_32_a
I'm going home.
Asuna
640257_31_a
...Sorry, I'm just not feeling
myself today.
Asuna
640257_30_a
Yeah, yeah, Kirito. We've heard
that a thousand times.
Klein
640257_29_a
...!
Asuna
640257_28_a
remember that you can count on me.
I'll always be here to protect you.
Kirito
640257_27_a
If so, I'm sorry, Asuna. We're
safe here in ALO, but if you ever
feel afraid,
Kirito
640257_26_a
Huh?
Asuna
640257_25_a
Unless... Wait... Were you
actually scared?
Kirito
640257_24_a
...
Asuna
640257_23_a
You're not the kind of person to
be scared by that kind of stuff...
Kirito
640257_22_a
But back then, you were the
legendary Lightning Flash...
Kirito
640257_21_a
Didja see them and get freaked
out, remembering what happened?
Klein
640257_20_a
Hey, those kinds of monsters used
to show up in SAO all the time.
Klein
640257_19_a
A-Ah, no.
Nothing at all.
Asuna
640257_18_a
Hmm?
You say something?
Kirito
640257_17_a
Still scared of ghosts...? I guess
some things never change...
Asuna
640257_16_a
Oh yeah, I forgot about that...
Klein
640257_15_a
It's not Asuna's fault.
She's just not great with
undead enemies.
Kirito
640257_14_a
What's with you today?
Klein
640257_13_a
Yeesh, Asuna! Your moves were
all over the place.
Klein
640257_12_a
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Kirito
640257_11_a
Yes, I am, thank you...
I mean, uh, yeah, just fine.
Asuna
640257_10_a
Are you all right, Asuna?
Kirito
640257_9_a
...
Asuna
640257_8_a
Klein
640257_7_a
Asuna
640257_6_a
Phew... That was tougher
than I thought.
Kirito
640257_5_a
Gwaaargh....!!
Monster
640257_4_a
Klein
640257_3_a
Asuna
640257_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Hrrraaagh!
Kirito
640257_1_a
Ha ha! Well, you'll figure it out.
Klein
640255_22_a
How am I supposed to do that?
Kirito
640255_21_a
you better man up and prove
she can count on you.
Klein
640255_20_a
Seriously...? Anyway, I dunno
what's going on, but when a girl
gets like that,
Klein
640255_19_a
I didn't do anything!
Kirito
640255_18_a
Fess up, K-Dawg.
What'd you do?
Klein
640255_17_a
She seems different today...
Kirito
640255_16_a
Geez...
What's her problem?
Klein
640255_15_a
Just forget about it. We need to
get started on today's task-er,
I mean, quest...
Asuna
640255_14_a
...!
Asuna
640255_13_a
No way! C'mon, Klein!
Mind your own business...
Kirito
640255_12_a
Huh...? Is that what this is?!
Asuna
640255_11_a
What's with you two?
Lover's tiff, eh?
Klein
640255_10_a
N-No, that's not it.
Asuna
640255_9_a
Are you sick?
Kirito
640255_8_a
Er, it's...nothing.
Nothing at all.
Asuna
640255_7_a
Asuna...?
What's wrong?
Kirito
640255_6_a
...
Asuna
640255_5_a
Hey!
Kirito
640255_4_a
Asuna
640255_3_a
Kirito
640255_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Good! Now let's get this
show on the road!
Klein
640255_1_a
Hehe... Got it.
Kirito
640253_24_a
I say count yourself lucky if
this is your biggest worry!
Klein
640253_23_a
Hahaha!
Yeah, something like that.
Klein
640253_22_a
Ha ha... Well, they do say all's
fair in love and war, right?
Kirito
640253_21_a
You're already a damn hero.
Go for it!
Klein
640253_20_a
SAO'S legendary vice commander
"Lightning Flash" Asuna wouldn't
go for just any dude.
Klein
640253_19_a
Real talk, K-Dawg...
Klein
640253_18_a
What if they don't think I'm
good enough for Asuna?
Kirito
640253_17_a
I hear she's calmed down about
it recently, but still...
Kirito
640253_16_a
Plus, Asuna's mom has always been
bothered by how much time her
daughter spends in virtual reality.
Kirito
640253_15_a
I don't regret what I did at all,
but in the end, I still made her
dad lose face.
Kirito
640253_14_a
It's just...I despised the man
Asuna's father promised her
hand to.
Kirito
640253_13_a
O-Of course not! My feelings for
Asuna haven't changed a bit
since SAO.
Kirito
640253_12_a
Don't tell me you've gone and
fallen for some other chick!
Klein
640253_11_a
...
Kirito
640253_10_a
So why's Asuna's mom
got you so freaked out?
Klein
640253_9_a
Yeah, I know that, but still...
Kirito
640253_8_a
But all you gotta do is
meet Asuna's mom and
it'll all be over, right?
Klein
640253_7_a
It's kinda weird.
Klein
640253_6_a
Man, I don't think I've
ever seen you looking
this depressed.
Klein
640253_5_a
Klein.
Kirito
640253_4_a
Kirito
640253_3_a
Yo, K-Dawg!
I heard what went down.
Klein
640253_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
...
Kirito
640253_1_a
...
Asuna
640251_27_a
Uh, yeah...
Kirito
640251_26_a
We can't keep reusing the
same excuses forever.
Asuna
640251_25_a
I'm just kidding...
Anyway, you'd better
think about this too!
Asuna
640251_24_a
W-W-Wait a sec...!
Kirito
640251_23_a
how about I bring Mom here
again and sort things out?
Asuna
640251_22_a
What do we do? If you
won't come talk to her
in the real world,
Asuna
640251_21_a
Y-Yikes, that's rough...
Kirito
640251_20_a
But that's why she won't get off
my case about the pictures!
Asuna
640251_19_a
R-Really...? On the bright
side, at least she's showing
an interest.
Kirito
640251_18_a
Well, she's changed a lot lately.
She's even starting to get
interested in VRMMOs herself.
Asuna
640251_17_a
So why not tell her that it was
just a fun event in an online
game?
Kirito
640251_16_a
But she doesn't like VRMMOs
very much...
Kirito
640251_15_a
Yeah.
Asuna
640251_14_a
Oh, right... You wanted to show
her our forest, didn't you?
Kirito
640251_13_a
Yeah, don't you remember?
She dived in using my spare
avatar once.
Asuna
640251_12_a
Wait, your mom recognized you
even as an Undine?
Kirito
640251_11_a
She completely flipped out and
demanded a full explanation.
Asuna
640251_10_a
Wha-!
Kirito
640251_9_a
And Mom saw them!
Asuna
640251_8_a
So I printed out some screenshots
and stuck them up around my room.
Asuna
640251_7_a
Y-Yeah... I was so excited about
having a wedding here...
Asuna
640251_6_a
Of course. In that ALO event,
right?
Kirito
640251_5_a
Remember our wedding ceremony?
Asuna
640251_4_a
What's wrong, Asuna?
Kirito
640251_3_a
Kirito
640251_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
K-Kirito!
Time to panic!!
Asuna
640251_1_a
Really...?
Premiere
640228_19_a
You're gonna get me in HUGE
trouble if you don't stop! Like,
serious trouble!
Kirito
640228_18_a
No, no, no, that's not my point!
Kirito
640228_17_a
Why? It is only logical that
couples would have mutual
"cherished memories," correct?
Premiere
640228_16_a
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, there are
so many problems here. Let's just
pause for a second.
Kirito
640228_15_a
Yes, and our time in SA:O is also
a "cherished memory" of mine.
Premiere
640228_14_a
That's the same thing you said in
SA:O, and no, we're not dating!
Kirito
640228_13_a
Whoa! Hold it right there!
Kirito
640228_12_a
Kirito, are we...dating?
Premiere
640228_11_a
What's up?
Kirito
640228_10_a
Hehe.
Premiere
640228_9_a
Oh yeah? Ha ha. Well, I'm sure to
be reminded of it whenever
I see you wearing it.
Kirito
640228_8_a
Indeed. I will think of our
journey together whenever I equip
this outfit.
Premiere
640228_7_a
But at least we got some Girls'
Day clothing, huh?
Kirito
640228_6_a
Yep. We didn't get the empress's
clothes in the end, though...
Kirito
640228_5_a
The court ladies who serve under
the empress.
Premiere
640228_4_a
Called it! That's the clothing for
the three court ladies.
Kirito
640228_3_a
Kirito
640228_2_a
bg_18_tower_road_sunset
Look what I received, Kirito.
Premiere
640228_1_a
I think we can get something even
if we give up here.
Kirito
640227_33_a
As well it should.
Shall we head back?
Kirito
640227_32_a
A "cherished memory"...
This phrase gives me a warm
feeling.
Premiere
640227_31_a
Actually, we'd call it a cherished
memory.
Kirito
640227_30_a
A "memory"?
Premiere
640227_29_a
That's what we call a memory.
Kirito
640227_28_a
I will never forget how we fought
side-by-side.
Premiere
640227_27_a
Honestly, I'm just glad that's how
you feel.
Kirito
640227_26_a
I am glad.
Premiere
640227_25_a
You know I'm always happy to help
you, Premiere.
Kirito
640227_24_a
I am satisfied knowing that you
care about me enough to go through
this much trouble.
Premiere
640227_23_a
You fought through a quest you had
little chance of completing.
All for my sake.
Premiere
640227_22_a
You always help me when I am
in need.
Premiere
640227_21_a
I am glad we made it this far.
Premiere
640227_20_a
Okay with what?
Kirito
640227_19_a
Understood. I am okay.
Premiere
640227_18_a
But I think this is about as far
as we'll get.
Kirito
640227_17_a
Yeah, the potion's kicking in.
I'm good.
Kirito
640227_16_a
bg_event_fire_cave
Are you okay, Kirito?
Premiere
640227_15_a
F-Forgive me...
Kirito
640227_14_a
Take hold of my shoulder.
Premiere
640227_13_a
Kirito!
Premiere
640227_12_a
Premiere
640227_11_a
bg_event_fire_cave_boss
Hng!
Kirito
640227_10_a
bg_black
Grah!
Monster
640227_9_a
Premiere
640227_8_a
I'm...fine...!
Kirito
640227_7_a
But you are in danger...!
Premiere
640227_6_a
Focus on your own safety!
Kirito
640227_5_a
Don't worry about me, Premiere!
Kirito
640227_4_a
Graaaah!
Monster
640227_3_a
Kirito
640227_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave_boss
K-Kirito!
Premiere
640227_1_a
Yes. Understood.
Premiere
640225_21_a
I want you to understand that.
Kirito
640225_20_a
But I'll say it again: we stand
almost no chance of obtaining
these items.
Kirito
640225_19_a
Thank you, Kirito.
Premiere
640225_18_a
Besides, who am I to stand in your
way?
Kirito
640225_17_a
You seem really excited about it,
and that's good enough for me.
Kirito
640225_16_a
Well, alright then, let's give
this Cait Sith event a shot!
Kirito
640225_15_a
Are you sure...?
Kirito
640225_14_a
I still wish to try.
Premiere
640225_13_a
I see...
Premiere
640225_12_a
I'm not gonna lie.
This'll be really tough.
Kirito
640225_11_a
It's just you and me, Premiere.
Kirito
640225_10_a
Unfortunately it seems they're all
busy at the moment.
Kirito
640225_9_a
Shall we request the assistance
of Asuna and the others?
Premiere
640225_8_a
Not to mention everyone will be
fighting for them all at once.
Kirito
640225_7_a
The hardest to get, yeah.
Kirito
640225_6_a
That makes the emperor and empress
outfits...
Premiere
640225_5_a
And they only get harder as you
work your way up the levels
of the doll display.
Kirito
640225_4_a
All of the ones that give you
doll outfits are SUPER difficult.
Kirito
640225_3_a
Premiere
640225_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
There are plenty of Girls' Day
quests, but...
Kirito
640225_1_a
We're in a tight spot, Premiere.
Kirito
640223_17_a
What is wrong, Kirito?
Premiere
640223_16_a
Are you kidding me!
Kirito
640223_15_a
...
Kirito
640223_14_a
Um, I'll have to look that up.
Hang on.
Kirito
640223_13_a
Which quest must we complete in
order to obtain these items?
Premiere
640223_12_a
I don't think you have it quite
right, but she's definitely a
noble lady.
Kirito
640223_11_a
The empress is thus equivalent to
the goddess of SA:O who gave
me this role to play, correct?
Premiere
640223_10_a
Uh, well, yeah, I guess so.
Kirito
640223_9_a
The Hina is their empress,
correct?
Premiere
640223_8_a
Yes. And the Hina outfit for me,
if possible.
Premiere
640223_7_a
Some what? Doll clothing?
Kirito
640223_6_a
Fascinating. I would like some.
Premiere
640223_5_a
You can get all of their clothing
at official Girls' Day events too.
Kirito
640223_4_a
Right. Three ladies of the court
and five of their musicians on the
bottom, all of whom are unique.
Kirito
640223_3_a
Kirito
640223_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
I see. So people in the real world
decorate displays with dolls.
Premiere
640223_1_a
Sure thing.
Kirito
640221_18_a
Please tell me more about it.
Premiere
640221_17_a
However, I still do not comprehend
Girls' Day.
Premiere
640221_16_a
Good to hear.
Kirito
640221_15_a
Agreed. Your words have calmed me.
Premiere
640221_14_a
Well, that's all that matters.
Kirito
640221_13_a
However, I am very glad I
participated. It was most
enjoyable.
Premiere
640221_12_a
That is indeed a complicated thing
to determine.
Premiere
640221_11_a
You just have to know when it's
okay to do that, ha ha.
Kirito
640221_10_a
But it's also important to break
down barriers and try new things
too.
Kirito
640221_9_a
Don't get me wrong. Rules and
manners and all that are
important.
Kirito
640221_8_a
Impressed? I see...
Premiere
640221_7_a
I mean, I'm not even mad! I'm just
impressed!
Kirito
640221_6_a
You have my apologies. I was not
aware that only Cait Sith could
participate.
Premiere
640221_5_a
They're saying you really kicked
some butt at the player-organized
Cait Sith event!
Kirito
640221_4_a
Premiere, I heard what happened!
Kirito
640221_3_a
Kirito
640221_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hello, Kirito.
Premiere
640221_1_a
Kirito
640218_38_a
Hehehe.
Asuna
640218_37_a
Yui
640218_36_a
Oh yeah?!
Well, I'm gonna win SO hard!
Sphica
640218_35_a
I'm going to thoroughly trounce
you this time!
Seven
640218_34_a
Seven
640218_33_a
Yui
640218_32_a
Of course!
Now come on, let's play!
Sphica
640218_31_a
Kirito
640218_30_a
Wow, that sounds like fun!
Is it okay if we join?
Asuna
640218_29_a
It's like a mini-game version of
hide-and-seek!
Yui
640218_28_a
Sphica
640218_27_a
Seven
640218_26_a
We're playing a game that Seven
and Sphica thought up.
Yui
640218_25_a
Asuna
640218_24_a
Sure!
So, uh...what are we doing?
Kirito
640218_23_a
Yui
640218_22_a
We've been waiting for you!
Come on, join us!
Sphica
640218_21_a
Yui
640218_20_a
Sphica
640218_19_a
Oh, hey Kirito! Hey Asuna!
You guys FINALLY came back!
Seven
640218_18_a
Wow... It looks like we had
nothing to worry about.
Asuna
640218_17_a
It's only been a few hours and
already these three are thick as
thieves.
Kirito
640218_16_a
Asuna
640218_15_a
Ha ha...
I'm flabbergasted!
Kirito
640218_14_a
Yui
640218_13_a
H-Hey! No do-overs!
Seven
640218_12_a
Yeah! That game didn't count!
Do over! I demand a do-over!
Yui
640218_11_a
That was so lame!
You tried to sound cool,
but you're just a cheater!
Sphica
640218_10_a
I'm a scientist!
We don't make the rules,
we abuse 'em!
Seven
640218_9_a
You've gotta be smart to win, kid!
Me? I'll do anything it takes to
reach my goal!
Seven
640218_8_a
Is that so?
Well, we never said we
couldn't use them, right?
Seven
640218_7_a
We never said we could use items!
That's unfair!
Sphica
640218_6_a
Yeah! I saw you use an item a
second ago!
Yui
640218_5_a
Seven, you cheated!
Sphica
640218_4_a
Yui
640218_3_a
Sphica
640218_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Yay!
I won!
Seven
640218_1_a
Bring out that MHCP magic...
Asuna
640217_15_a
bg_event_asuna_room_real
Yui...please...
If there was ever a need for your
original programming, it's now.
Asuna
640217_14_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
Yeah... Let's just pray that Yui
and Seven can help Sphica get
over her fears...
Kazuto
640217_13_a
bg_event_asuna_room_real
I think she understands how her
parents feel, too...
Asuna
640217_12_a
Besides, no matter how hard we try
to help her, it won't matter if she
doesn't want to be helped.
Kazuto
640217_11_a
But our only choice here is to
hope her desire to change can
overcome her fears.
Kazuto
640217_10_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
Not going to lie: she might.
Kazuto
640217_9_a
bg_event_asuna_room_real
But won't Sphica just panic and
run?
Asuna
640217_8_a
She'd hide and wouldn't try to
talk to Seven or Yui at all.
Kazuto
640217_7_a
Besides, if we stayed around,
Sphica would just keep relying on
us.
Kazuto
640217_6_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
I think I get Seven's point.
Drastic times call for drastic
measures.
Kazuto
640217_5_a
bg_event_asuna_room_real
Do...you think it'll be all
right?
Asuna
640217_4_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
Hey, no worries. We just finished
diving, anyway.
Kazuto
640217_3_a
bg_event_asuna_room_real
Sorry for calling this late...
Asuna
640217_2_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
Oh, hey Asuna.
Kazuto
640217_1_a
Yui
640215_46_a
Oh yeah, don't forget to leave
Yui up and running, okay?
Seven
640215_45_a
Sphica
640215_44_a
Asuna
640215_43_a
Seven...
Kirito
640215_42_a
having a "guardian" like you two
around is just going to be a huge
hindrance.
Seven
640215_41_a
Yui
640215_40_a
I know the deal with her.
Still, in this sort of situation,
Seven
640215_39_a
Sphica
640215_38_a
S-Seven, are you sure that's a
good idea?
Asuna
640215_37_a
Sphica
640215_36_a
Asuna
640215_35_a
Do what now?
Kirito
640215_34_a
Kirito, Asuna.
Can you log out?
Seven
640215_33_a
Yui
640215_32_a
...
Seven
640215_31_a
Sphica
640215_30_a
It looks like she's got an innate
fear of kids her age...
Kirito
640215_29_a
Kirito
640215_28_a
Asuna
640215_27_a
They're scary...
Sphica
640215_26_a
Don't be rude, girl!
I'm not going to bite!
Seven
640215_25_a
Seven
640215_24_a
Mommy, Daddy? Is she okay?
She's hiding behind you,
and I think she's crying?
Yui
640215_23_a
Kirito
640215_22_a
Asuna
640215_21_a
sniff
Sphica
640215_20_a
Kirito
640215_19_a
Sphica?
Asuna
640215_18_a
Yui
640215_17_a
Sphica
640215_16_a
Wh-What? Got a problem?
Seven
640215_15_a
...
Sphica
640215_14_a
Seven
640215_13_a
Sphica
640215_12_a
That's correct.
Yui
640215_11_a
You two have met before,
right, Yui?
Kirito
640215_9_a
Asuna
640215_10_a
Seven
640215_8_a
Sphica
640215_7_a
It's very nice to meet you,
Sphica.
Yui
640215_6_a
Kirito
640215_5_a
Yup!
Asuna
640215_4_a
Sphica
640215_3_a
Asuna
640215_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
So this is Sphica?
Seven
640215_1_a
Yeah! Well, close enough!
I'll ask them to meet you!
I bet you'll be fast friends!
Asuna
640213_24_a
Yui and Seven? They're my age?
Sphica
640213_23_a
Physically, yeah, but I think
mentally she's in her own
special category...
Kirito
640213_22_a
And we know someone else too!
Seven's around Sphica's age!
Asuna
640213_21_a
Sphica
640213_20_a
Good idea!
Kirito
640213_19_a
Yeah!
Yui! She's around Sphica's age!
Asuna
640213_18_a
But there aren't many...
OH!
Kirito
640213_17_a
As practice for going back to
school, why not try to make
friends your own age here in VR?
Asuna
640213_16_a
Sphica
640213_15_a
Kirito
640213_14_a
Oh, I've got an idea!
What about this?
Asuna
640213_13_a
Well...VRMMO players are
mostly in their teens or older.
There aren't many kids your age.
Kirito
640213_12_a
But...
Will I be able to get along
with kids my own age?
Sphica
640213_11_a
And I made friends with all sorts
of older people too...
Sphica
640213_10_a
I met you two here in the virtual
world...
Sphica
640213_9_a
...
Asuna
640213_8_a
Sphica...
Kirito
640213_7_a
I have pretty bad memories of
school...
Sphica
640213_6_a
I'm gonna start going to school
again in the real world.
Sphica
640213_5_a
Worried? About what?
Asuna
640213_4_a
Kirito
640213_3_a
Asuna
640213_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
But...I'm kinda worried.
Sphica
640213_1_a
Ahaha, sorry, Sphica!
They're not tears of sadness:
they're tears of joy!
Asuna
640211_25_a
What's wrong, you two?
Are you crying?
Sphica
640211_24_a
It sure was. We really didn't do
anything special, but they still
wrote us such a nice letter...
Kirito
640211_23_a
That was a lovely letter...
Asuna
640211_22_a
That's it!
Sphica
640211_21_a
Come visit us anytime in the real
world. I'm sure Sphica would love
to see you.
Sphica
640211_20_a
Thank you so much for helping
our daughter get better.
Sphica
640211_19_a
A large part of her recovery is
due to you two keeping her spirits
up.
Sphica
640211_18_a
She still needs to go in for
regular checkups, but things
are looking up right now.
Sphica
640211_17_a
Thanks to your help, she
has been safely discharged
from the hospital.
Sphica
640211_16_a
Kirito
640211_15_a
Asuna
640211_14_a
Dear friends of Sphica
That's me!
"Thank you for always
playing games with our daughter."
Sphica
640211_13_a
I'm gonna read it, okay?
Sphica
640211_12_a
Kirito
640211_11_a
Huh?
Your parents wrote us a letter?
Asuna
640211_10_a
My mommy and daddy!
Sphica
640211_9_a
A letter? From who?
Kirito
640211_8_a
Guess what?!
I brought you two a letter!
Sphica
640211_7_a
Hi! Hello there! Whee!
Sphica
640211_6_a
Hello there, Sphica.
Asuna
640211_5_a
Oh, hey Sphica.
Kirito
640211_4_a
Asuna
640211_3_a
Kirito
640211_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Kirito!
Asuna!
Sphica
640211_1_a
You would do that? Thank you!
And please don't feel like you
need to go easy on her!
Yui
640208_20_a
It can be my way of thanking her
for the outfit.
Leafa
640208_19_a
Why don't I show her the ropes?
I can be her mentor.
Leafa
640208_18_a
Y-Yeah...
Yui
640208_17_a
Meaning she's not cut out to
be a maid?
Leafa
640208_16_a
Unlike me, she's the type to
really go her own way.
Yui
640208_15_a
She's a Mental Health Counselling
Program like me, so I'm sure she
can manage, but...
Yui
640208_14_a
Do you think Strea'll be okay?
Yui
640208_13_a
I see.
Asuna
640208_12_a
She just went to the
head maid for assignment.
Leafa
640208_11_a
Ah! She decided to try out
the full maid quest after all.
Leafa
640208_10_a
By the way, where did Strea go?
Yui
640208_9_a
Ahaha...
Well, there's always next time.
Leafa
640208_8_a
Aww, that's too bad. I would
have liked to see you in a
maid outfit, Leafa!
Asuna
640208_7_a
So it's all got to go
in the laundry now.
Leafa
640208_6_a
Yeah... But in the end, that
one ended up getting filthy
in the dairy too...
Leafa
640208_5_a
That worked out well!
Asuna
640208_4_a
Yui
640208_3_a
Leafa
640208_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Cool... So that's how you got
your own maid outfit, Leafa.
Asuna
640208_1_a
Th-Thank you...
Leafa
640207_23_a
Of course! I can always just
make another one.
Strea
640207_22_a
B-But...is it really okay
for me to have this?
Leafa
640207_21_a
Heh heh! It'll be fine!
Just try it on!
Strea
640207_20_a
What?! H-How can you say that
without blushing, Strea?!
Leafa
640207_19_a
It'll look great on you, Leafa!
Your boobs are about the same size
as mine, so it should fit just fine.
Strea
640207_18_a
I'll give you the maid outfit
I made, so you can change
into that!
Strea
640207_17_a
Hm?
Leafa
640207_16_a
Aha!
I've got an idea!
Strea
640207_15_a
Why in the world would they make
the clothes get this filthy...?
Leafa
640207_14_a
It seems the devs for this
maid quest were serious
sticklers for realism...
Leafa
640207_13_a
Wh-Whoa, they really are...
ALO equipment normally doesn't
get anywhere near this dirty...
Leafa
640207_12_a
Oh no... Leafa, your clothes!
They're a mess!
Strea
640207_11_a
Eheheh... Sorry.
Strea
640207_10_a
At least now you know the grim
reality of a dairy maid's burden.
Leafa
640207_9_a
Ahaha...
It isn't such a big deal.
Leafa
640207_8_a
I probably would have
given up by now.
Strea
640207_7_a
Wow...
That really is hard work.
Strea
640207_6_a
Mooo...!
Cow
640207_5_a
H-Hey!!
Get back here!
Leafa
640207_4_a
Moooooo!!
Cow
640207_3_a
Strea
640207_2_a
bg_event_field
Argh! Aw, come on!
Hold still!
Leafa
640207_1_a
Yeah. The only saving grace is
that the game doesn't recreate
those awful smells. Hahaha...
Leafa
640205_17_a
Hmmm... It must be
physically tiring work.
Strea
640205_16_a
Yeah. Plus, cows can really hurt
you if they get angry.
Leafa
640205_15_a
What? Like your clothes get dirty?
Strea
640205_14_a
You might think it would be easy
'cause it's a VRMMO, but looking
after animals is messy work.
Leafa
640205_13_a
Strea
640205_12_a
Besides, dairy work is tougher
than you think.
Leafa
640205_11_a
Hehehe! Sorry.
Strea
640205_10_a
Q-Quit it already!
Leafa
640205_9_a
It sounds like fun!
I wanna squeeze a cow teat!
Strea
640205_8_a
Oh, come on! Don't be so
self-conscious!
Strea
640205_7_a
I-It's embarrassing!
Leafa
640205_6_a
Erm, I wouldn't exactly
put it in those words...
Leafa
640205_5_a
Wow! So you get to squeeze
the cows' teats!
Strea
640205_4_a
I'm a dairy maid today! Milking
cows and making cheese...
That kind of thing.
Leafa
640205_3_a
Leafa
640205_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Speaking of which, Leafa,
what kind of maid jobs are
you doing?
Strea
640205_1_a
Hmmm, I guess I see your point.
Leafa
640203_18_a
But me? I just put together
whatever I think is cute.
Strea
640203_17_a
When she makes an outfit, she's got
the design sense and the know-how
to make something really special.
Strea
640203_16_a
Hehe, I don't know about that...
After all, Ashley has lots of
experience with these things.
Strea
640203_15_a
Wow! You've really been at it
lately. You could probably give
Ashley a run for her money!
Leafa
640203_14_a
Yup! Sure did!
Strea
640203_13_a
Did you make that
all by yourself, Strea?
Leafa
640203_12_a
Whoa!
A maid outfit!
Leafa
640203_11_a
So...
Does that mean I can't wear this?
Strea
640203_10_a
What?
Really?
Strea
640203_9_a
or after completing
certain side-quests.
Leafa
640203_8_a
But maids only get their uniforms
once they're allowed to work inside
the estate,
Leafa
640203_7_a
Yeah.
I sure am.
Leafa
640203_6_a
Weren't you doing the
maid quest with Asuna
and the other girls?
Strea
640203_5_a
Hmm? Leafa, how come you
aren't wearing a maid outfit?
Strea
640203_4_a
Hi there, Strea!
Leafa
640203_3_a
Leafa
640203_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Yoohoo!
Here I am!
Strea
640203_1_a
Hehe! Yui, you're acting like
such a big sister.
Asuna
640201_17_a
Of course we will!
Leafa
640201_16_a
Everyone, remember to
be nice to her, okay?
Yui
640201_15_a
Hahaha!
That's Strea for you.
Leafa
640201_14_a
But I think she mainly just wanted
to play dress-up in the maid outfit.
Asuna
640201_13_a
Yeah... Though she said she wanted
to the last time I saw her.
Asuna
640201_12_a
Strea? Now that you mention it,
she didn't do this maid
quest, did she...?
Leafa
640201_11_a
Come to think of it,
I think Strea is around
here somewhere too.
Yui
640201_10_a
You should! I'll teach you
the basics.
Leafa
640201_9_a
Ooo, neat...
That sounds pretty fun!
I want to try that sometime.
Asuna
640201_8_a
Well, it refers to any manufacturer of
dairy products. Even yogurt!
Leafa
640201_7_a
A dairy maid...?
Is that a maid who churns
butter and milks cows?
Yui
640201_6_a
It was fun, though! I liked
being a dairy maid.
Leafa
640201_5_a
You said it, Leafa.
Asuna
640201_4_a
Yui
640201_3_a
Asuna
640201_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Phew! Talk about a long day.
Leafa
640201_1_a
Mommy, Daddy! You're the best!
Yui
640198_26_a
You're welcome. I mean, thank you!
You helped me see a very nice
fairy tale.
Yui
640198_25_a
What I'm trying to say is
"thank you, Yui."
Kirito
640198_24_a
It was your compassion and your
tears that brought this story to
a close.
Kirito
640198_23_a
But we could never have finished
this story without you, Yui.
Kirito
640198_22_a
Yeah, neither did we. Until that
last part, anyway.
Kirito
640198_21_a
W-Wow, I didn't realize I was
part of the story at all.
Yui
640198_20_a
Yeah. It's all thanks to her that
we were able to complete this
fairy tale.
Kirito
640198_19_a
So the final fairy in this story
turned out to be Yui?
Asuna
640198_18_a
I only remembered it when I saw
your tear turn into a pearl.
Kirito
640198_17_a
It's Hans Christian Andersen's
"The Last Pearl."
Kirito
640198_16_a
Daddy... This story...
Yui
640198_15_a
I'm sure they'll be overjoyed to
hear that.
Kirito
640198_14_a
And I swear to do all I can to aid
the poor family who taught me this
harsh yet fair lesson.
Lord
640198_13_a
And perhaps I allowed myself to be
blinded to what is truly important
in life. I won't forget again.
Lord
640198_12_a
This Last Pearl... Perhaps its
lesson is not just the final gift,
but the greatest gift of all.
Lord
640198_11_a
Material wealth is pointless
unless your spirit is rich as
well.
Lord
640198_10_a
I...see. The other pearls spoke of
fame and fortune, but this pearl's
message is more important by far.
Lord
640198_9_a
The last gift we can receive is
to be welcomed into a joyous
afterlife when our day comes.
Kirito
640198_8_a
That all who live must one day
perish.
Kirito
640198_7_a
The Last Pearl symbolizes life's
most inescapable truth.
Kirito
640198_6_a
This is the fairies' final gift.
A crystal tear: "The Last Pearl."
Kirito
640198_5_a
Asuna
640198_4_a
Yui

...
Lord
640198_1_a
They're what?!
Yui
640197_35_a
They're turning into pearls?!
Kirito
640197_34_a
Y-Yui, your tears!
Asuna
640197_33_a
Y-Yui?!
Kirito
640197_32_a
What is it, Mommy?
Yui
640197_31_a
There, there, Yui...
Huh?!
Asuna
640197_30_a
I know that there's nothing we can
do, but... This is too sad to
bear... 
sniff
Yui
640197_29_a
while another family has lost
someone dear to them and struggles
to survive...
Yui
640197_28_a
One family is celebrating the
birth of a child and getting
wonderful presents from fairies,
Yui
640197_27_a
Yui...
Kirito
640197_26_a
This is so...so sad...
sniff
...
Yui
640197_25_a
sniff
... 
sob
...
Children
640197_24_a
I'm sad that they must grow up
without a mother, but I have no
choice but to continue on.
Man
640197_23_a
There was nothing we could do...
She was always sickly...
Man
640197_22_a
That's terrible...
Asuna
640197_21_a
Asuna
640197_20_a
Yui
640197_19_a
Kirito
640197_18_a
My beloved wife passed away just
yesterday... My children have yet
to accept that she's gone...
Man
640197_17_a
Huh?
Asuna
640197_16_a
sob
...
Mommy...
Mommy!
Children
640197_15_a
Why are your children crying?
Kirito
640197_14_a
Y-Yes, that I do...
Man
640197_13_a
Asuna
640197_12_a
Yui
640197_11_a
You live here?
Kirito
640197_10_a
I'm surprised to see you, good
fairies. What brings you to my
humble home?
Man
640197_9_a
Hey, do you hear that? I think
there are children crying inside...
Asuna
640197_8_a
sniff
... 
sob
...
???
640197_7_a
Yeah. It's definitely a hovel.
Anyway, let's check it out.
Kirito
640197_6_a
That house is like the polar
opposite of the lord's manor.
Look how small it is.
Asuna
640197_5_a
It is pretty late. Well, the only
house we haven't been to yet is
over there.
Kirito
640197_4_a
Asuna
640197_3_a
Kirito
640197_2_a
bg_21_alne_night
It's certainly gotten dark.
Yui
640197_1_a
Maybe that's part of it... Well,
grumbling won't get us anywhere.
Let's start looking.
Kirito
640195_27_a
A lot of old fairy tales were set
in an era where the nobility had
a divine mandate to rule...
Asuna
640195_26_a
Maybe these fairies are trying to
suck up to the powerful?
Kirito
640195_25_a
Yeah, fair point... Why does the
rich guy get special treatment?
Asuna
640195_24_a
I don't know about you, but that
sounds pretty unfair to me.
Kirito
640195_23_a
Hmm, you might be right. But the
way he phrased it, only the lord
gets gifts around here.
Kirito
640195_22_a
So if we search the area, we might
find some sort of hint.
Yui
640195_21_a
According to the lord, these
fairies and their gifts are a part
of local custom and tradition.
Yui
640195_20_a
How about we start asking around
to find out if anyone's seen this
fairy?
Asuna
640195_19_a
Yui
640195_18_a
Asuna
640195_17_a
bg_21_alne
Well then, where do we start
looking?
Kirito
640195_16_a
Sure. Leave it to us.
Kirito
640195_15_a
I beg of you, good fairies!
Find her!
Lord
640195_14_a
What? You would do that for me?
I... I would be in your debt!
Lord
640195_13_a
Excuse me. Perhaps we could find
this missing fairy for you.
Kirito
640195_12_a
Yeah, good idea.
Kirito
640195_11_a
I think you're right, but let's
ask the lord if that's okay first.
Asuna
640195_10_a
Yeah, it looks like our job is
to go look for this missing fairy.
Kirito
640195_9_a
Daddy, do you think...?
Yui
640195_8_a
...
Kirito
640195_7_a
Where could she be?
Lord
640195_6_a
We have waited long, but there is
still no sign of her...
Lord
640195_5_a
Asuna
640195_4_a
Yui
640195_3_a
Kirito
640195_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Truth be told, one fairy is yet
missing from our company.
Lord
640195_1_a
Phew... But then why do you look
so troubled?
Kirito
640193_33_a
O-Oh, we thank you. Phew, we
dodged a bullet there...
Asuna
640193_32_a
You are not from this land. It
would be rude of me to demand
you follow our customs.
Lord
640193_31_a
Do not worry, good fairies.
Lord
640193_30_a
Umm... Well...
Kirito
640193_29_a
Hm? Why do you apologize?
Did you think I would be angry
with you for coming empty-handed?
Lord
640193_28_a
Umm... Hahaha, forgive me, milord.
We didn't bring you anything...
Kirito
640193_27_a
Eep! What do we do?!
Asuna
640193_26_a
We're fairies too, after all!
Kirito
640193_25_a
Hmm... Oh! Maybe he's mad that we
didn't bring him presents?
Kirito
640193_24_a
You're right. He was in such good
spirits before too. I wonder
what happened?
Yui
640193_23_a
Kirito
640193_22_a
Yui
640193_21_a
Huh? He suddenly started looking
really troubled...
Asuna
640193_20_a
Hrmm...
Lord
640193_19_a
Yeah, I don't recognize it either.
I guess it's not a very popular
one...
Kirito
640193_18_a
It definitely sounds like a fairy
tale, but I've never heard of
this one...
Asuna
640193_17_a
That is a very interesting custom.
Yui
640193_16_a
Wow. Sweet deal.
Kirito
640193_15_a
Every time a child is born to my
house, the fairies bestow magical
presents upon them.
Lord
640193_14_a
These fairies have long resided in
this land. We have a custom here,
you see.
Lord
640193_13_a
I would agree. They look like me,
and they're tiny like me too!
Yui
640193_12_a
They seem more like pixies to me.
Asuna
640193_11_a
Asuna
640193_9_a
Those are fairies?
Kirito
640193_8_a
Yui
640193_10_a
And I bestow upon thee a magic
pearl as well. You will never lack
for friends.
Fairy D
640193_7_a
I too bestow upon thee a magic
pearl. You shall be loved by all.
Fairy C
640193_6_a
I bestow upon thee a magic pearl.
With it, you shall never go hungry.
Fairy B

It shall bring you great fortune.
Fairy A
640193_1_a
Let's go!
Yui
640191_21_a
Well, that grabbed my attention.
Let's check it out.
Kirito
640191_20_a
Other fairies?
Asuna
640191_19_a
Other fairies have just arrived
to join the festivities as well!
Lord
640191_18_a
You there, kind fairies! Come
inside and celebrate!
Lord
640191_17_a
Cool. So he's just inviting random
strangers to the party? Seems
like a generous guy.
Kirito
640191_16_a
Apparently, his first child was
born just yesterday, so he's
having a celebration.
Yui
640191_15_a
According to the quest description,
that man is this town's lord.
Yui
640191_14_a
But why's he inviting everyone in
town into his home?
Asuna
640191_13_a
Hey, look over there. There's a
rich-looking guy standing in front
of a manor.
Asuna
640191_12_a
What's the commotion?
Kirito
640191_11_a
Come, everyone! Come inside to
celebrate with me! Come in,
come in!

Yippee! What a wonderful day!
A wonderful day!

Hehe, I'm looking forward to it
too!
Yui

Yeah, I'm excited to see the
next fairy tale!

Let's see what else Andersen
Island has in store for us.
Kirito
640191_1_a
Yeah, what he said!
Nothing to see here! Move along!
Yuuki
640188_21_a
Nothing! You must be imagining
things.
Kirito
640188_20_a
What are you hiding?
Asuna
640188_19_a
Waaaait a minute, something's up
with you two!
Asuna
640188_18_a
Heh, thanks Kirito!
Yuuki
640188_17_a
Nice work, Yuuki.
Kirito
640188_16_a
You think so? Oh man, I'm glad to
hear that!
Yuuki
640188_15_a
Yeah, that's a good way to put it!
I haven't seen you enjoy yourself
that much since your last duel!
Liz
640188_14_a
Comfy, huh?
Yuuki
640188_13_a
Yeah, you really seemed
comfortable up on stage!
Leafa
640188_12_a
But your dancing was definitely
much better today.
Silica
640188_11_a
There's no need to apologize for
that, Yuuki!
Silica
640188_10_a
I know, I'm sorry. But it was
something I had to work through
on my own.
Yuuki
640188_9_a
Why didn't you say so? We could've
helped you out or something.
Sinon
640188_8_a
Oh yeah?
Asuna
640188_7_a
Hehe, thanks. I've been working on
my dancing a lot lately, to cut
down on my mistakes.
Yuuki

Absolutely! Especially you, Yuuki!
That was your best yet!

Good!
Yuuki

I don't think she'd have a problem
with it at all, but if you'd
rather I not say anything, fine.
Kirito
640187_26_a
I dunno. It just seems like it
might cause problems.
Yuuki
640187_25_a
Well, I know how much Asuna wants
you all to herself, so if she
heard about this...
Yuuki
640187_24_a
I mean, sure, but...why keep it
a secret?
Kirito
640187_23_a
As far as Asuna and the others are
concerned, you didn't teach me
anything. Okay?
Yuuki
640187_22_a
Oh, and um...
Yuuki
640187_21_a
Got it. Thanks, Kirito. I'll give
these training methods a shot!
Yuuki
640187_20_a
Just keep practicing, and don't
get too down on yourself.
Kirito
640187_19_a
VRMMOs are all about muscle memory
and intuition, so you just need to
keep practicing.
Kirito
640187_18_a
Uh, yeah. There aren't really any
instructions for this one,
so that might be best.
Yuuki
640187_17_a
Would that be easier for you?
Kirito
640187_16_a
And it probably will, haha.
I'll leave the room while you
try it out.
Kirito
640187_15_a
Okay... But I'm just picturing it
in my head, and it looks
ridiculous...
Yuuki
640187_14_a
That should help you approach
performing with greater ease.
At least, I think it should.
Kirito
640187_13_a
It'll help you bridge the gap
between your effortless fighting
and your hang-ups about dancing.
Kirito
640187_12_a
Oh, that's a piece of
did you say
AT THE SAME TIME?!
Yuuki
640187_11_a
All you have to do is sing and
fight at the same time.
Kirito
640187_10_a
Yep. Don't worry though, this
one's simple.
Kirito
640187_9_a
Oh yeah... I forgot that you had
two methods of training.
Yuuki
640187_8_a
Don't be so modest! C'mon, let's
try another routine.
Kirito
640187_7_a
You're gonna make me blush!
Yuuki
640187_6_a
Easy with the praise there!
Yuuki
640187_5_a
You move really well in combat,
and those clean movements carry
over to your dancing.
Kirito
640187_4_a
You were doing pretty well,
though!
Kirito

Kirito
640187_2_a
bg_event_field
Man, sword dancing's harder than I
thought it'd be.
Yuuki
640187_1_a
Sounds good!
Yuuki
640185_20_a
Let's practice alongside them and
see how it goes.
Kirito
640185_19_a
Very true. I've found a couple of
videos that might help you out.
Kirito
640185_18_a
But we won't know until we try!
Yuuki
640185_17_a
Ah, I see. Yeah, that might help!
Yuuki
640185_16_a
Right. I wonder if holding a
weapon would help trick your brain
into thinking you're fighting.
Kirito
640185_15_a
Sure. Even if I didn't, the name
pretty much says it all.
Yuuki
640185_14_a
Do you know what sword dancing is?
Kirito
640185_13_a
Well, I'm going to have to see you
do both. So first, tell me...
Kirito
640185_12_a
So... How do we actually DO that?
Yuuki
640185_11_a
Basically we just need to get you
to think about dancing and battle
in the same way.
Kirito
640185_10_a
How?
Yuuki
640185_9_a
Now we're going to work on
breaking down the barrier between
the two.
Kirito
640185_8_a
Right... I think.
Yuuki
640185_7_a
And the second is for fighting,
where you move to adapt to a given
situation.
Kirito
640185_6_a
The first is for dancing
following
a set routine.
Kirito
640185_5_a
Basically, you've got two modes of
thinking you can tap into.
Kirito
640185_4_a
Uh, yes please!
Yuuki
640185_3_a
Yuuki
640185_2_a
bg_event_field
Okay, let's start practicing, and
see if we can't minimize those
mistakes.
Kirito
640185_1_a
Seriously?!
Yuuki
640183_21_a
I think there's a way for you to
conquer dancing just like you've
conquered fighting.
Kirito
640183_20_a
What is it? Got an idea?
Yuuki
640183_19_a
Although...
Kirito
640183_18_a
Sure, I can understand that,
based on your situation.
Kirito
640183_17_a
I've also never done anything like
this in the real world, so...
Yuuki
640183_16_a
Heh. Yeah, that could be it.
Yuuki
640183_15_a
I see. So free-form battle is
fine, but following a routine
makes you panic.
Kirito
640183_14_a
I think I get too hung up on what
the next move is, and I freeze.
Yuuki
640183_13_a
so maybe it's the fact that I have
to follow a routine that's messing
me up.
Yuuki
640183_12_a
Yeah, if I get to move as I please
in front of a crowd that's fine,
Yuuki
640183_11_a
Though I guess dancing and
fighting are a little bit
different.
Kirito
640183_10_a
Those always attract huge crowds,
and it never seems to bother you.
Kirito
640183_9_a
That doesn't make sense either,
though. You've fought in dueling
tournaments!
Kirito
640183_8_a
Stage fright? Haha, could be!
Maybe the crowd throws me off.
Yuuki
640183_7_a
Wait. Maybe it's
Kirito
640183_6_a
But when it comes to showtime,
I'm just no good.
Yuuki
640183_5_a
That's not possible, though.
You look great in practice.
Kirito
640183_4_a
Yeah...
Yuuki
640183_3_a
Yuuki
640183_2_a
bg_event_peaceful_town
That you suddenly lose the ability
to dance, or something?
Kirito
640183_1_a
Yeah... But it has to be
Yuuki
640181_21_a
It's really strange.
Kirito
640181_20_a
And you're a cut above the rest
when it comes to in-game action,
so I really don't know.
Kirito
640181_19_a
You practice almost twice as much
as the others, and I never notice
any mistakes then.
Kirito
640181_18_a
But you already know you're
messing up, and honestly, I'm not
sure I can tell you why.
Kirito
640181_17_a
Called it...
Yuuki
640181_16_a
And occasionally you miss some
moves that should be really
easy.
Kirito
640181_15_a
Alright, if you insist. It's true.
You make a lot of mistakes.
Kirito
640181_14_a
...
Kirito
640181_13_a
Don't try to deflect, or sugar-
coat it, either. You must notice.
Yuuki
640181_12_a
Well
Kirito
640181_11_a
I mess up a lot, don't I?
Yuuki
640181_10_a
You watch our shows all the time,
so I'm sure you notice.
Yuuki
640181_9_a
...
Kirito
640181_8_a
I know I shouldn't, but I can't
figure out what I'm doing wrong.
Yuuki
640181_7_a
Ah, it wasn't so bad. Don't beat
yourself up over it.
Kirito
640181_6_a
That "little dance move" cost us
points... I'm really sorry.
Yuuki
640181_5_a
Oh, hey Kirito. Yeah, I can't
get it out of my head...
Yuuki
640181_4_a
Still hung up over that little
dance move you missed on stage?
Kirito
640181_3_a
Kirito
640181_2_a
bg_event_idol_stage_open_space
Argh, I screwed up again.
Yuuki
640181_1_a
Hahaha...
Kirito
640178_23_a
N-No, no toeing the line!
Asuna
640178_22_a
I love real world fashion, so I'm
going to try to toe the line to
make what I wanna make!
Strea
640178_21_a
W-Well, yeah, but...
Asuna
640178_20_a
Flaunting it can be an important
part of coordinating a hot outfit!
Strea
640178_19_a
But...but... Even in the real
world, girls wear miniskirts and
camisoles and so on!
Strea
640178_18_a
Asuna? Could you not glare at me?
Kirito
640178_17_a
For example...AHEM.
Asuna
640178_16_a
Some creep?
For example?
Strea
640178_15_a
Dress code violations aside, you
never know when some creep's
trying to eye you up.
Asuna
640178_14_a
Actually, how about you just take
however much skin you plan on
showing and half it?
Asuna
640178_13_a
Yeah, good idea.
Strea
640178_12_a
It might be a good idea to get
permission ahead of time from now
on, just in case.
Kirito
640178_11_a
So I can relax and sew to my
heart's content!
Strea
640178_10_a
Yup. I had to gather all the
materials again, but now I have
official approval to make it!
Strea
640178_9_a
and asked them to let you know
ahead of time if it would violate
the dress code, right?
Yui
640178_8_a
You redesigned the outfit to be
much less scandalous, sent it to
the GMs,
Yui
640178_7_a
N-No! I said no! Like a thousand
times!
Kirito
640178_6_a
Yeah, right. You still wish they
would've let her keep the design
the way it was, don't you?!
Asuna
640178_5_a
Phew... I'm just happy everything
worked out...
Kirito
640178_4_a
Asuna
640178_3_a
Kirito
640178_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Woohoo!
Woohoo!!
Strea
640178_1_a
Somebody...please help me...
Kirito
640177_36_a
No! Ask! Ask ask ask!!
Strea
640177_35_a
You won't ask, RIGHT?!
Asuna
640177_34_a
Umm... Help?
Kirito
640177_33_a
Hold up! Nuh-uh! You're asking
for me! You got that, Kirito?!
Strea
640177_32_a
So you won't send in the request
then, RIGHT, Kirito?
Asuna
640177_31_a
I'm not liking this look I'm
getting from you right now...
Kirito
640177_30_a
N-No, not at all...!
Um... A-Asuna?
Kirito
640177_29_a
Huh?
Kirito
640177_28_a
You just want to see Strea in that
revealing outfit, don't you?
Asuna
640177_27_a
Kirito...
Asuna
640177_26_a
Waaait a sec...
Asuna
640177_25_a
That's right. At the very least,
asking nicely will get someone to
take a look at it.
Asuna
640177_24_a
Then again...sometimes a politely
phrased message is all you need to
get your way...
Kirito
640177_23_a
What?! You were actually planning
on asking? About THIS?!
Kirito
640177_22_a
Umm... I believe Kirito was the
one who was supposed to do that...
Asuna
640177_21_a
You aren't even going to send in
an official query now, are you?!
Strea
640177_20_a
Asuna, now you're against me too?!
Strea
640177_19_a
So they must use an automatic
system for it. Sorry, Strea.
You're out of luck.
Asuna
640177_18_a
I doubt the GMs have the time to
review each and every one of them
manually.
Asuna
640177_17_a
There are a lot of people who try
to create their own original
clothes with the sewing skill.
Asuna
640177_16_a
What?! Whaaat?! No waaay!
It's way cuter like this!
Strea
640177_15_a
But this outfit Strea designed
goes way beyond what is normally
deemed socially acceptable.
Yui
640177_14_a
I know that cheerleader outfits
tend to be rather provocative...
Yui
640177_13_a
Anything that violates it
like
outfits that leave nothing to the
imagination
are auto-deleted.
Kirito
640177_12_a
and deemed it went far beyond
moral decency. I bet this game has
a filter for mature content.
Kirito
640177_11_a
Yeah, I'm not surprised. The
system probably calculated the
sheer area of exposed skin
Kirito
640177_10_a
Besides, you haven't even seen it!
It errored out and got deleted the
second I finished it!
Strea
640177_9_a
What?! Seriously?! How can you
say that?! You barely even glanced
at my design!
Strea
640177_8_a
Yeah...
Asuna
640177_7_a
It's WAY too inappropriate.
This is definitely beyond PG-13.
Kirito
640177_6_a
The reason Strea's original design
got rejected by the system is
obvious.
Kirito
640177_5_a
Do you really even need to ask?
Kirito
640177_4_a
Kirito
640177_3_a
Strea
640177_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Kirito, what do you think?
Asuna
640177_1_a
Umm...how do I put it?
I think I can see why it got
rejected by the system...
Asuna
640175_32_a
Th-This is very...
Yui
640175_31_a
Waaah!
Asuna
640175_30_a
Alright, so here you go!
The design, ta-dah!
Strea
640175_29_a
Oh, good point...
I'll just ask Kirito to do it.
Asuna
640175_28_a
Perhaps it would be better to ask
an unaffiliated third party to
send the request?
Yui
640175_27_a
But, Mommy, you have direct
personal ties with RECT Progress,
the company that runs ALO.
Yui
640175_26_a
Yeah, they might just ignore a
question from an NPC.
Strea
640175_25_a
It'll be better if the request is
sent by a player, so I'll handle
it.
Asuna
640175_24_a
Oh, great idea!
Thanks, Asuna!
Strea
640175_23_a
We might get a detailed response
explaining why the outfit was
rejected by the system.
Asuna
640175_22_a
We should send in an official
query with the outfit's model
data attached for reference.
Asuna
640175_21_a
Huh? Sure, I guess...
Strea
640175_20_a
Strea, can I see that design you
drew up?
Asuna
640175_19_a
A dress code violation?
Asuna
640175_18_a
But my guess is that the outfit
violated some kind of dress code.
Yui
640175_17_a
I didn't see the error myself,
so I can only offer a hypothesis.
Yui
640175_16_a
Yui, do you know how this could
have happened?
Asuna
640175_15_a
UGH! I am SO upset right now!!
Strea
640175_14_a
...
Yui
640175_13_a
No way!
Asuna
640175_12_a
But then this weird error popped
up and the entire outfit got
deleted!!
Strea
640175_11_a
I gathered all the materials,
drew up the design, and finally
finished it!
Strea
640175_10_a
R-Right...
Asuna
640175_9_a
I said I was going to go make my
own cheerleader outfit the other
day, right?!
Strea
640175_8_a
Asuna, listen to this!
It's so unfair!
Strea
640175_7_a
Yui
640175_6_a
Strea
640175_5_a
Hey, what's the ruckus about?
Asuna
640175_4_a
Strea, please calm down.
Yui
640175_3_a
Yui
640175_2_a
bg_18_tower_road_sunset
UGH! What the heck is up with
THAT?!
Strea
640175_1_a
Heh, sounds like fun.
Asuna
640173_25_a
Nope! But I'm going to make that
outfit soon, so we're going to
have to throw a fashion show!
Strea
640173_24_a
So...in other words, we're not
going on that cheerleader quest?
Asuna
640173_23_a
I just want to wear all sorts of
cute outfits. That's it!
Strea
640173_22_a
Ahaha, Yui, no way! I didn't even
think about that for a second!
Strea
640173_21_a
to get closer to the human players
from the real world?
Yui
640173_20_a
Strea is an MHCP. Perhaps those
feelings of yours are part of a
conscious effort
Yui
640173_19_a
I leveled up my sewing skill so I
could go out there and try all of
them out!
Strea
640173_18_a
EXACTLY! They're fantastic!
So I refuse to wait for the devs
to add them to the game!
Strea
640173_17_a
Real world clothing is pretty
different from the usual fantasy
fare you find in ALO.
Asuna
640173_16_a
And I just HAVE to try them on!
Strea
640173_15_a
Whenever I search for info on the
real world, I see all these
ADORABLE outfits!!
Strea
640173_14_a
Y-Yeah...?
Asuna
640173_13_a
We're NPCs, right? That means
we can't go to the real world.
Strea
640173_12_a
Oh, well...
Strea
640173_11_a
It is at that... Which makes me
curious: why DID you level up
your sewing skill?
Asuna
640173_10_a
Now that you mention it, your
sewing skill is pretty impressive,
Strea.
Yui
640173_9_a
Of course! I mean, probably!
Strea
640173_8_a
Make it? Is that possible?
Asuna
640173_7_a
I thought about it a bunch, and I
decided to try making my own!
Strea
640173_6_a
Well, about that...
Strea
640173_5_a
Have you decided which quest to
take to get the cheerleader
outfit?
Yui
640173_4_a
Asuna
640173_3_a
Strea
640173_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Oh, hi Strea.
Yui
640173_1_a
Understood!
Yui
640171_17_a
Alright then, I might just take
you two up on that offer! Let me
take a look at the quests first.
Strea
640171_16_a
Hehe, she's our little warrior!
Asuna
640171_15_a
Hehe, Yui! Awww! You're so fierce
now that you can fight!
Strea
640171_14_a
Give me a chance and I won't let
you down!
Yui
640171_13_a
I... I'm still learning how to
fight, so I don't know if I'll be
much help, but I'll do what I can!
Yui
640171_12_a
Do you want any help?
I'm happy to give it.
Asuna
640171_11_a
Really? In that case, I'm going to
go give one a shot. I hope there's
an easy one!
Strea
640171_10_a
Originally, yes, but the outfit
was so popular that they made it
the reward for a bunch of quests.
Yui
640171_9_a
It's still available? I thought
it was for a limited-time
only.
Strea
640171_8_a
Well, if you want one, why not do
the quest to get one?
Asuna
640171_7_a
They're so cute!
I want one SO bad!
Strea
640171_6_a
You and Asuna! You got those
awesome cheerleader outfits, but
I got nothin'!
Strea
640171_5_a
Strea, what are you jealous of?
Yui
640171_4_a
Asuna
640171_3_a
Yui
640171_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
So jealous!
So jealouuus!
Strea
640171_1_a
ははは……
キリト
640168_29_a
いえ、それだけは譲れません……
わたしは食べることで
この世界を理解していきたいんです
プレミア
640168_28_a
これ以上食べ続けたら
飛べなくなっちゃうかもよ!
アスナ
640168_27_a
プ、プレミアちゃん
やっぱり食べ過ぎはダメだよ!
アスナ
640168_26_a
もぐもぐ……
プレミア
640168_25_a
なに……もしかして
どら焼きを食べたからなのか!?
キリト
640168_24_a
今プレミアちゃんの
体重が……増えた!!
アスナ
640168_23_a
アスナ!?
キリト

わわっ!!
アスナ
640168_21_a
そんなに食べたいんだね……
アスナ
640168_20_a
仕方なくこれを食べていました……
プレミア

これは先日買ったどら焼きです
キリトとアスナにケーキを買いに
行くのを止められてしまったので
プレミア
640168_18_a
わっ、プレミアちゃんそれは!?
アスナ
640168_17_a
もぐもぐ……
プレミア
640168_16_a
ゲームへの適応が適宜行われてる中で
体重も追加されたってことなのか
キリト
640168_15_a
プレミアはこのALOでも
異質なアバターだからな
キリト
640168_14_a
そして……
軽い……
アスナ
640168_13_a
ほ、ホントだ……
体重が表示されてるよ……
アスナ
640168_12_a
わたしにはよくわかりません……
プレミア
640168_11_a
……?
なぜこの数値をキリトが見ることが
ダメなんですか?
プレミア
640168_10_a
そ、それもそうか……
すみません……
プレミアも悪かったな
キリト
640168_9_a
プレミアちゃん女の子なんだから
体重を見るなんてしちゃダメでしょ!
アスナ
640168_8_a
キリトくん
デリカシーがないのは
ダメだよ!
アスナ
640168_7_a
ぎゃ!
な、なにすんだよアスナ!
キリト

ななっ……
プレミアのステータスに
体重が新規追加されたってのか!?
キリト
640168_1_a
それは……Weight
だそうです
プレミア
640167_39_a
えっ!?
アスナ
640167_38_a
わたしの力や体力などを示す
表示項目に新たな数値が
追加されました
プレミア
640167_37_a
プレミア、どうした?
キリト
640167_36_a
あっ……!
プレミア
640167_35_a
言われてみれば……
キリト
640167_34_a
カスタマイズしない限りは
ないはずだけど……
アスナ
640167_33_a
わたしたちプレイヤーなら
そもそも設定された
アバターの見た目が変わるなんて
アスナ
640167_32_a
えっ、あっ……
キリト
640167_31_a
プレミアちゃんってNPCだよね……
NPCが食べ過ぎると
どうなるの……?
アスナ
640167_30_a
どうした、アスナ?
キリト
640167_29_a
確かに仮想世界なら
体重は増えないけど……ん?
アスナ
640167_28_a
ほら、あいつ現実世界で摂生しなきゃ
いけない分、こっちだと大食いになる
傾向にあるから……
キリト
640167_27_a
いやぁ……
スグのやつがさ、プレミアが喜ぶ
もんだから調子づいちゃって……
キリト
640167_26_a
さすがに食べ過ぎじゃ……
アスナ
640167_25_a
はい、その日は二つの街を
巡ったので計十食ということに
なります
640167_24_a
ごっ……五食!?
それが一つの街ってことは……
アスナ
640167_23_a
間食含めて一つの街で
五食も取っていたんですよ!
640167_22_a
この間ママが不在で
リーファさんと冒険したときに
プレミアさんは
640167_21_a
ユイちゃん?
アスナ
640167_20_a
ママ、そうなんです!
640167_19_a
まさかわたしがいない間に
また色々と食べさせちゃったの!?
アスナ
640167_18_a
プレミアがALOに興味持ってくれる
なら、きっかけはなんだって
いいじゃないか……
キリト
640167_17_a
いや、えと……ほら
キリト
640167_16_a
プレミアちゃんがますます
食への探求心が強くなってるよ?
アスナ
640167_15_a
えと……
キリトくん……
これは一体……?

周辺で採れる農作物や気候に応じた
料理など、食を知ることこそ
世界を知ることに繋がるんです
プレミア
640167_13_a
アスナ
食べ物と食事は
その土地の特徴を表します
プレミア
640167_12_a
もっと街の特徴とか、
どんなクエストがあるかとか
そういう話をしようよ
アスナ
640167_11_a
ちょっとちょっとキリトくん
次の街に辿り着くなり
すぐに食べ物の話?
アスナ
640167_10_a
あ、ああ……そうそう
キリト
640167_9_a
あのすごく可愛らしい見た目で
果物が乗っているお菓子ですよね!
プレミア
640167_8_a
ケーキ……
なにかの本で見ました!
プレミア
640167_7_a
えっ?
キリト
640167_6_a
あっ、キリト、アスナ
この街では名物の
ケーキがあるらしいですね
プレミア
640167_5_a
アスナ

よし、次の街についたな
キリト
640167_1_a
ははは……
キリト
640165_34_a
なるほど
勉強になります!
プレミア
640165_33_a
その土地の風土や文化を理解するには
まずその場所の特産品や料理を
食べればいいってことだよ!
リーファ
640165_32_a
リーファ
それはどういう意味ですか?
プレミア
640165_31_a
それよりも食べ物を知ることこそ、
このALOっていう世界を知ることに
繋がっていくんだよ!
リーファ
640165_30_a
はは、VRMMOで
アバターが食べ過ぎで太るなんて
聞いたことないよ!
リーファ
640165_29_a
このままじゃプレミアが
太るんじゃないかって……
キリト
640165_28_a
いや……アスナに色々と
言われちゃってさ
キリト
640165_27_a
えっ? なんで?
リーファ
640165_26_a
お、おいリーファ
あんまりプレミアに食べ物ばっかり
勧めるなよ
キリト
640165_25_a
ああっ、でもあそこに
ソフトクリームも売ってる～!
リーファ
640165_24_a
はい! クレープは前に食べましたが
こちらの世界のクレープも
とても美味しそうですね
プレミア
640165_23_a
じゃあケバブでランチして
クレープをデザートにしようね!
リーファ
640165_22_a
あっ、プレミアちゃん!
あそこにクレープも売ってる!
リーファ
640165_21_a
………………
キリト
640165_20_a
ケバブ……
なんだか食欲をそそられる
匂いがします……!
プレミア
640165_19_a
キリト
640165_18_a
プレミア
640165_17_a
bg_21_alne
プレミアちゃん
これ、ケバブって言うんだよ!
リーファ
640165_16_a
はい!
プレミア
640165_15_a
はは、どっちだっていいさ
さあ、じゃあ行こう
キリト
640165_14_a
ああ、でもプレミアちゃんも
空を飛べるようになったなら、
行脚のニュアンスはちょっと違うかな
リーファ
640165_13_a
行脚ですね、了解しました
プレミア
640165_12_a
はは、ALOの世界を
色々と見て回ろうってことさ
キリト
640165_11_a
あんぎゃ……?
プレミア
640165_10_a
だから代わりにあたしが
今日はプレミアちゃんのALO行脚に
付き合うね!
リーファ
640165_9_a
ああ、ちょっと今日は用事が
あるらしいって
キリト
640165_8_a
でも……今日はアスナは?
プレミア
640165_7_a
はは、スグ……じゃなかった
リーファとも再会できて
良かったな、プレミア
キリト
640165_6_a
SA:Oから無事に
コンバートできたのって
ホントだったんだね～!
リーファ
640165_5_a
リーファ!
お久しぶりです
プレミア
640165_4_a
プレミア
640165_3_a
キリト
640165_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
プレミアちゃん!
久しぶり～!
リーファ
640165_1_a
ははは……
キリト
640163_23_a
このままじゃ
プレミアちゃん太っちゃうかもよ～!
アスナ
640163_22_a
もーっ、前から色々と
食べさせてたのはキリトくんでしょ!
アスナ
640163_21_a
はは……前から素質はあったけど、
ずいぶん食いしん坊キャラに
なっちゃったな
キリト
640163_20_a
ちょ、ちょっと見てきます!
プレミア
640163_19_a
どーなつ!?
プレミア
640163_18_a
あっ、そう言えば
あの角を曲がったところで
ドーナツ屋があったよな
キリト
640163_17_a
あはは、プレミアちゃん
焦らなくてもいいから
一つずつ教えてあげるから
アスナ
640163_16_a
そ、それはどこに!?
プレミア
640163_15_a
はは……
ああ、きっとあるぞ
キリト
640163_14_a
クッキーよりも美味しい
お菓子もあるというんですか?
プレミア
640163_13_a
ほ、本当ですか!?
プレミア
640163_12_a
SA:Oにはなかった食べ物も
ここならきっといっぱいあると思うぜ
キリト
640163_11_a
VRMMOっていうのは
成熟するほど食事の
種類も増えるんだよな
キリト
640163_10_a
まぁでも食材は後からアップデート
されたり、料理もプレイヤーの工夫で
レパートリーが増えていくし……
キリト
640163_9_a
なんだか大袈裟だな
キリト
640163_8_a
は、はい……
ALO、素晴らしいです!
プレミア
640163_7_a
あはは……確かに
SA:Oではピザなかったかもね
アスナ
640163_6_a
こ、こんな美味しいものが……
この世界にはあるんですね……!
プレミア
640163_5_a
ん、ああ
それはピザだ
キリト
640163_4_a
アスナ
640163_3_a
キリト
640163_2_a
bg_21_alne
もぐもぐ……
こ、これは……!
プレミア
640163_1_a
よろしくお願いします
プレミア
640161_18_a
そうだね
アスナ
640161_17_a
そこからイグシティに登って、
各地の種族の首都を巡ろうぜ
キリト
640161_16_a
そうだな……やっぱり基本から
こなしていったほうがいいから、
アルンに行こう
キリト
640161_15_a
最初にどこに行こうか?
アスナ
640161_14_a
はい!
プレミア
640161_13_a
SA:Oよりもたくさんの
街があるから期待しててくれ
キリト
640161_12_a
よし、じゃあまず一緒に
街に行ってみようぜ
キリト
640161_11_a
ああ、そう言えばそうだな
プレミアは飛行練習にかかりきりで
この辺から動いたことなかったな
キリト
640161_10_a
なのでそろそろALOの
冒険を始めたいのですが
プレミア
640161_9_a
最初の頃よりだいぶ上達したよね
アスナ
640161_8_a
代わりの能力として浮遊術を
練習してきたけど……
アスナ
640161_7_a
うん、そうだね
ALOではプレミアちゃんは
翅の飛行ができないから
アスナ
640161_6_a
わたしの浮遊術……
だいぶ様になってきたと
思いませんか?
プレミア
640161_5_a
プレミア、どうした?
キリト
640161_4_a
アスナ
640161_3_a
キリト
640161_2_a
bg_event_field
キリト、アスナ
プレミア
640161_1_a
そうかもしれませんね
640158_17_a
せっかく読書を楽しんでるのに
悪いもんね
アスナ
640158_16_a
ふふっ、そうだったんだね
じゃあもう少ししてから、
声をかけよっかな
アスナ
640158_15_a
今も新しい本を探しに
行ったみたいですよ
640158_14_a
どうも最近恋愛小説に
はまっているみたいで、
640158_13_a
ふふっ、そうだね
まさかプレミアちゃんがあそこまで
熱弁を振るうとは思わなかったけど
アスナ
640158_12_a
それもプレミアさんの
おかげですよね!
640158_11_a
二人の幸せな新しい生活が
始められて良かったなぁって……
アスナ
640158_10_a
そうそう
駆け落ちって聞いてなんか
ドキッとしちゃったけど……
アスナ
640158_9_a
ああ、あのスプリガンと
ウンディーネのお二人ですよね
640158_8_a
プレミアちゃんと一緒に
挨拶にでも行こうかなって
アスナ
640158_7_a
うん、この間駆け落ちした二人が
山奥の新しい家で暮らし始めたって
連絡があったから
アスナ
640158_6_a
二人でどこかに行くつもり
だったんですか?
640158_5_a
ああ、そうなんだ
ちょっと待たせちゃったかな
アスナ
640158_4_a
あっ、ママ
プレミアさんは今図書館に
本を読みに行くと……
640158_3_a
640158_2_a
bg_21_alne
あれ?
ユイちゃん、プレミアちゃんは
どこに行ったの?
アスナ
640158_1_a
あはは……
それも恋愛小説で読んだのかな?
アスナ
640157_34_a
そう……!
恋のキューピットというやつです!
プレミア
640157_33_a
女神というのはこの場合の表現として
少し間違っていると思います……
プレミア
640157_32_a
そう言えばSA:Oのプレミアさんは
女神という設定があったんでしたね
640157_31_a
ふふっ、あの二人……
まさかプレミアちゃんの正体に
気づいてたのかな?
アスナ
640157_30_a
女神……
プレミア
640157_29_a
ありがとうございました!
ウンディーネの少女
640157_28_a
じゃあ俺たちは行くよ
さよなら
スプリガンの少年
640157_27_a
女神……
プレミア
640157_26_a
キミはまるで……
俺たちを結ばせるために現れた
女神みたいだ……
スプリガンの少年
640157_25_a
うん、そうだね
助言をくれたキミ……ありがとう
スプリガンの少年
640157_24_a
二人でしがらみのない所で
生きていこうね……
ウンディーネの少女
640157_23_a
ああ、出ていくつもりだ
スプリガンの少年
640157_22_a
じゃあ二人でここを出ていくんですね
プレミア
640157_21_a
ああ、ありがとう……
わたしも……その言葉を待っていたの
ウンディーネの少女
640157_20_a
甘かったんだ……
キミのために、俺は種族も捨てるよ
スプリガンの少年
640157_19_a
ここは中立域だからって
どちらも捨てないで済む方法が
あるはずだなんて考えてた自分が
スプリガンの少年
640157_18_a
えっ!?
ウンディーネの少女
640157_17_a
プレミア
640157_16_a
640157_15_a
アスナ
640157_14_a
わかったよ……
俺も男だ
キミをさらって……ここを去ろう
スプリガンの少年
640157_13_a
そうですね
640157_12_a
わからないけど……
わたしたちの分もプレミアちゃんが
熱弁してくれたって思ってるよ
アスナ
640157_11_a
ママ、プレミアさんの説得に
この二人は応じるでしょうか?
640157_10_a
………………
アスナ
640157_9_a
………………
スプリガンの少年
640157_8_a
それともあなたたちの気持ちは
その程度のものだったんですか?
プレミア
640157_7_a
そんな……
スプリガンの少年
640157_6_a
二人で離れたくないのなら
そうすべきです
プレミア
640157_5_a
プレミア
640157_4_a
640157_3_a
アスナ
640157_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley_sunset
えっ!?
駆け落ち……?
ウンディーネの少女
640157_1_a
駆け落ちです!
640155_41_a
カケダシをするようにと!
プレミア
640155_40_a
はい!
それならあの二人にアドバイスを
しましょう
プレミア
640155_39_a
駆け落ちをしたとしても、
わたしはキリトくんと生きる道を
選んでた気がするよ……
アスナ
640155_38_a
結果的にはそれは大丈夫に
なったけど……
もしあれがあのままだったら
アスナ
640155_37_a
キリトくんを紹介しようとしても
母さんがまともに取り合って
くれなかったり……
アスナ
640155_36_a
わたしも一時期は父さんに決められた
相手と結婚させられそうになったり、
アスナ
640155_35_a
ママ……
640155_34_a
うん、確かに……
そうかも……
アスナ
640155_33_a
あはは……
そ、そうだね……
アスナ
640155_32_a
あっ、そうだったかもしれません
プレミア
640155_31_a
ええと……プレミアさん
それは駆け落ちではないでしょうか?
640155_30_a
親に結婚を認めてもらえない二人が
カケダシをすると……
プレミア
640155_29_a
はい、先日アルンにある
図書館で恋愛小説という物語を
読んでいたときに知った言葉です
プレミア
640155_28_a
カケダシ……?
駆け出して……ってこと?
アスナ
640155_27_a
カケダシをすればいいんです
プレミア
640155_26_a
たとえ種族が違っていても
二人で生きていく覚悟があるのなら
親や種族のことは関係ない
プレミア
640155_25_a
えっ……?
アスナ
640155_24_a
ならあの二人も
なにも問題はないのでは
ないでしょうか?
プレミア
640155_23_a
……その返事が聞けて安心しました
プレミア
640155_22_a
この世界のことを軽んじてるなんて
絶対にないからね!
アスナ
640155_21_a
この世界で経験することを
現実と同じくらい大切なものだって
思ってる……!
アスナ
640155_20_a
プレミアちゃん、それは違うよ!
わたしもキリトくんも……
リズやシノのんたちだって
アスナ
640155_19_a
そういう意味ですか?
プレミア
640155_18_a
それは……
こちらの世界で生きることが
現実世界よりも優先度が低い……
プレミア
640155_17_a
そちらの関係性が優先されるから……
という答えで理解できますか?
640155_16_a
それは……パパとママには
現実世界というもう一つの
生きる世界があって……
640155_15_a
そ、それはええと……
アスナ
640155_14_a
それに特にリーファやシノンたちも
別の種族なのにケンカしたことなど
見たことがありませんよ
プレミア
640155_13_a
えっ!?
アスナ
640155_12_a
でも……
キリトとアスナは
種族が違うのに仲が良いです
プレミア
640155_11_a
プレミアさん、前も言ったように、
このALOでは種族同士は
基本的に争う関係にあるんですよ
640155_10_a
えっ?
それはだから種族が違うからで……
アスナ
640155_9_a
どうして嘆くんでしょう……?
プレミア
640155_8_a
う、うん
アスナ
640155_7_a
そういうことでしたよね?
プレミア
640155_6_a
種族が違うために結ばれないことを
嘆いていた……
プレミア
640155_5_a
集落の人に聞いてわかったことは、
あの二人が恋仲であるということ
ですよね
プレミア
640155_4_a
プレミア
640155_3_a
640155_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
うーん……
これは参った……
アスナ
640155_1_a
そうですね
プレミア
640153_25_a
今の二人について
なにか知ってるかもしれない
行ってみようよ
アスナ
640153_24_a
ホントだ
集落に住んでる人みたいだね
アスナ
640153_23_a
ママ、あそこにも人がいますよ
こちらをジッと見ています
640153_22_a
えと……
ちょっと違う気が……
アスナ
640153_21_a
これは前に得た知識……
《痴情のもつれ》という
ものでしょうか
プレミア
640153_20_a
はい……
640153_19_a
二人とも行ってしまいましたね……
プレミア
640153_18_a
えっ……
アスナ
640153_17_a
すみませんでした
俺たちのことは忘れてください
スプリガンの少年
640153_16_a
でも……
ウンディーネの少女
640153_15_a
止めろよ
そんな話されても迷惑だろ?
スプリガンの少年
640153_14_a
ああ、旅の人……
どうか聞いてください
ウンディーネの少女
640153_13_a
あの……なにかあったんですか?
アスナ
640153_12_a
プレミア
640153_11_a
うん、そうだよ
ちょっと話しかけてみようか
アスナ
640153_10_a
NPCとは……この世界や
SA:Oの住人のことですよね
プレミア
640153_9_a
あの人たちはNPCのようですね
640153_8_a
プレミア
640153_7_a
640153_6_a
あそこに誰かいるね
アスナ
640153_5_a
それはわかってるさ……!
スプリガンの少年
640153_4_a
それでもわたしは
あなたと一緒にいたいんです……!
ウンディーネの少女
640153_3_a
父さんたちは決して
俺たちのことを認めようとは
しないだろう
スプリガンの少年
640153_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
そんな……
ウンディーネの少女
640153_1_a
プレミア
640151_18_a
ちょっと気になるね
行ってみようか
アスナ
640151_17_a
中立域の集落ですか
どんな人たちが
住んでるんでしょうか?
プレミア
640151_16_a
ホントだ……
村……ってほどでもないね
集落って感じかな
アスナ
640151_15_a
あっ、ママ
あそこに家が何軒かありますよ
640151_14_a
そうなんですね……
プレミア
640151_13_a
まぁそうだけど、だからこそ
妖精同士の抗争があるし、
モンスターも普通に出るかな……
アスナ
640151_12_a
ということは
この辺は誰が暮らしても
いいんですか？
プレミア
640151_11_a
うん、そうだよ
アスナ
640151_10_a
互いに争っているという……
プレミア
640151_9_a
種族とはこのALOの住人、
妖精たちの種族のことですよね
プレミア
640151_8_a
うん、要するに種族の
領地以外の場所ってことだね
アスナ
640151_7_a
中立域……?
プレミア
640151_6_a
この辺りは中立域と
呼ばれてるんですよ
640151_5_a
いえ……ありません
プレミア
640151_4_a
640151_3_a
プレミア
640151_2_a
bg_18_sky_morning
プレミアちゃん
この辺は来たことある?
アスナ
640151_1_a
I will!
Asuna
640128_39_a
Yeah, see you later then.
Have fun collecting those points!
Kirito
640128_38_a
Okay. I should really head back
to Liz and the others...
Asuna
640128_37_a
I'm going to sit back and watch
a little while longer.
Kirito
640128_36_a
But this is bringing you closer
to your friends, so you should
enjoy it.
Kirito
640128_35_a
Heh, I'm glad to hear that.
Kirito
640128_34_a
AR is fun in its own way,
but it's no match for VR.
Not to me, anyway.
Asuna
640128_33_a
I feel the same way.
Asuna
640128_32_a
And right now it's all about the
Augma and OS... It's taking people
away from VR.
Kirito
640128_31_a
VRMMOs really are something
special to me.
Kirito
640128_30_a
I mean, I said I wasn't going to
play OS...
Kirito
640128_29_a
What? Why? Are you embarrassed
or something?
Asuna
640128_28_a
Actually I'd prefer you don't say
anything about this to Sugu and
the gang.
Kirito
640128_27_a
We should join back up with the
others.
Asuna
640128_26_a
Asuna...
Kirito
640128_25_a
I hardly ever see you tired out
like this! It's a new side of you.
Asuna
640128_24_a
Wha-? How?
Kirito
640128_23_a
Aw, poor Kirito!
But this is good.
Asuna
640128_22_a
Heh, OS really tires you out,
doesn't it? I'm gonna be so sore
tomorrow. I'm way out of shape.
Kirito
640128_21_a
Are you okay?
Asuna
640128_20_a
That's...great... 
pant
wheeze
Kirito
640128_19_a
I got points for that, thanks
to you.
Asuna
640128_18_a
HYAAAH!
Asuna
640128_17_a
Graaaah?!
Monster
640128_16_a
Right!
Asuna
640128_15_a
Now's our chance if we're going
to stop these monsters.
Kirito
640128_14_a
Hehe, is that so? Thanks!
Asuna
640128_13_a
So I figured I'd see how things
were going.
Kirito
640128_12_a
I, uh... Well... I heard that you
guys were struggling with a
pretty tough quest.
Kirito
640128_11_a
Kirito?! But how?
Asuna
640128_10_a
Asuna
640128_9_a
It looked like you were having
some trouble.
Kirito
640128_8_a
What the-?!
Asuna
640128_7_a
Gulgyaaa?!
Monster
640128_6_a
Hah!
???
640128_5_a
We nearly had them, too!
Asuna
640128_4_a
Ungh... 
pant
pant
I can't
catch up to them! This is as
fast as I can go...!
Asuna
640128_3_a
Asuna
640128_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Gryaaaah!
Monster
640128_1_a
Roger that!
Liz
640127_32_a
They're all yours now!
Asuna
640127_31_a
Then I'll go around and ambush
them as they try to escape!
Asuna
640127_30_a
Those monsters are small enough
to fit through the entrance to it
and escape!
Sinon
640127_29_a
Bad idea. There's a path there!
Sinon
640127_28_a
Sinonon! Help us pin them against
that wall!
Asuna
640127_27_a
Silica
640127_26_b
You made it! Thanks for coming,
Sinon!
Liz
640127_25_b
It's Sinon!
Silica
640127_24_b
Sorry I'm late.
Let me give you a hand!
Sinon
640127_23_a
What just-?!
Asuna
640127_22_a
Okay!
Leafa
640127_21_a
Everyone, change formation!
Trap them against the wall!
Asuna
640127_20_a
Anyway! Fast enemies have to be
cornered so they can't escape!
Asuna
640127_19_a
You think?! Er, I mean... 
cough
I don't think so at all!
Asuna
640127_18_a
Hehe, you sounded like Kirito
just now, Asuna!
Silica
640127_17_a
Sh-She's right!
Silica
640127_16_a
And working out strategies like
this is what games are all about!
Asuna
640127_15_a
We knew this wasn't going to be
easy.
Asuna
640127_14_a
You can say that again.
There has to be a strategy,
though!
Asuna
640127_13_a
They're really making us earn
this skirt, aren't they!
Liz
640127_12_a
I-I missed again!
Leafa
640127_11_a
Graarrr!
Monster
640127_10_a
Hyah! Take THAT!
Leafa
640127_9_a
It's especially irritating because
we're using our own bodies here.
We're just not fast enough.
Asuna
640127_8_a
Fighting these fast enemies in
AR is stressing me out.
Silica
640127_7_a
Urgh... Speedy little bugger.
Liz
640127_6_a
Dang! It got away again!
Leafa
640127_5_a
Leafa
640127_4_a
Liz
640127_3_a
Asuna
640127_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Graaaah!
Monster
640127_1_a
Good idea! I think she's at work,
but I'll send her a message.
Asuna
640125_31_a
Let's invite Shino too, Asuna.
Just in case!
Rika
640125_30_a
Ahaha, still holding a bit of a
grudge, Suguha?
Asuna
640125_29_a
Let's do this-just the four of us!
Suguha
640125_28_a
And there aren't any guys around
to stop us!
Suguha
640125_27_a
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a new skirt!
Asuna
640125_26_a
Yep! Who is going to lay claim to
it, if not us!
Keiko
640125_25_a
Play OS and get a skirt for free?
That's catnip to gamer
fashionistas like us!
Rika
640125_24_a
Well, we all know what we're
playing for now!
Rika
640125_23_a
No lottery or first-come-first-
served policy or anything! That's
really nice!
Asuna
640125_22_a
And it says that anyone who has
collected points is eligible!
Asuna
640125_21_a
That's really cool. I never
thought they'd let you trade in
points for a skirt!
Keiko
640125_20_a
So it's a "Thanks for your
business!" kind of thing?
Suguha
640125_19_a
It says here that OS has increased
the value of their brand.
Rika
640125_18_a
Suguha
640125_17_a
Wow, that's a pretty big deal...
Asuna
640125_16_a
You earn special points that you
can trade in for a brand-new
skirt!
Rika
640125_15_a
Yeah! They're announcing a tie-in
campaign with OS!
Rika
640125_14_a
What is it, Rika? Er, isn't that
the site for the store's brand?
Suguha
640125_13_a
Guys, look at this!
Rika
640125_12_a
It's definitely good for the
store, but-
Asuna
640125_11_a
Sure. But, game promotion or not,
OS is a huge hit that just gave
them a ton of free advertising.
Suguha
640125_10_a
That's true. The store is already
cutting their prices to be part
of the promotion.
Keiko
640125_9_a
Yeah, but of course they won't let
you walk out of here with a
fortune in clothes for free!
Rika
640125_8_a
Well, you can use tickets on those
to get a discount.
Asuna
640125_7_a
You sure can. But clothes and such
don't seem to be covered.
Suguha
640125_6_a
You can exchange points for some
relatively cheap things, can't
you?
Asuna
640125_5_a
Wow! That's great!
Keiko
640125_4_a
Suguha
640125_3_a
Asuna
640125_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Ooh! You can cash in your points
for this handkerchief!
Rika
640125_1_a
Okay... Yeah, that sounds good!
Suguha
640123_23_a
Y-Yeah! It's time for a girls' day
out!
Keiko
640123_22_a
Guys wouldn't want to come
with us anyway, so it all works
out!
Rika
640123_21_a
Well, good! We were just gonna
take our hard-earned coupons
and shop at the boutique!
Rika
640123_20_a
But he's not interested in OS,
so there's not much we can do.
Rika
640123_19_a
Suguha...
Asuna
640123_18_a
If he really puts his mind to it,
I don't stand a chance against
him in kendo.
Suguha
640123_17_a
You guys may not know
this, but he's actually got
incredible reflexes.
Suguha
640123_16_a
Hahaha, yeah, you're right about
that.
Suguha
640123_15_a
And come to think of it, he said
he hadn't been exercising enough
lately.
Rika
640123_14_a
That could be. Not to mention
this game relies on athleticism
more than anything.
Asuna
640123_13_a
I don't think it would be easy for
him to adapt to not having those
powers.
Keiko
640123_12_a
This isn't like VR, though. You
can't rely on enhanced vision or
sensory abilities.
Keiko
640123_11_a
Oh, so THAT'S why you want him
to play!
Rika
640123_10_a
All the monster and PvP fights
would be SO much easier if he
were here too...
Suguha
640123_9_a
Yeah, I know...
Asuna
640123_8_a
Oh, well, obviously. He's not even
halfway interested in OS.
Rika
640123_7_a
Ha ha, she tried to convince
Kazuto to play with us, and it
didn't go so well.
Asuna
640123_6_a
Yeah, you've been sighing ever
since we started playing.
Keiko
640123_5_a
What's wrong, Suguha?
Rika
640123_4_a
Asuna
640123_3_a
Rika
640123_2_a
bg_os_cafe
sigh
Suguha
640123_1_a
Ha ha, okay. Keep an eye on her,
would you, Asuna?
Kazuto
640121_19_a
Don't worry! I'm simulating
kendo practice while I fight!
Suguha
640121_18_a
But don't get too absorbed!
You've got kendo practice
coming up soon!
Kazuto
640121_17_a
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Kazuto
640121_16_a
but I guess you'll just have to
miss out on all the fun!
Suguha
640121_15_a
Fine, fine! Keiko and Rika are
gonna come play,
Suguha
640121_14_a
E-Exactly. So don't worry about me.
You two just go enjoy yourselves,
okay?
Kazuto
640121_13_a
True, but everyone has their
own preferences. You can't force
someone to like something.
Asuna
640121_12_a
And we could go see virtual
concerts like Yuna's...
Suguha
640121_11_a
We could collect points, and then
all go out to eat and shop
together...
Suguha
640121_10_a
What? Are you saying you don't
want to play with Kazuto?
Suguha
640121_9_a
No need to push him into it,
Suguha.
Asuna
640121_8_a
I'm...just gonna stick to VR
where I'm more comfortable.
Kazuto
640121_7_a
Asuna and the others are playing
too!
Suguha
640121_6_a
Come play Ordinal Scale with all
of us!
Suguha
640121_5_a
Wh-What? What is it?
Kazuto
640121_4_a
Asuna
640121_3_a
Kazuto
640121_2_a
bg_18_school
Kazuto! Kazutoooo! Hey! Ka-zu-to!
Suguha
640121_1_a
Yay! I'll help!
Sphica
640108_57_a
Yui
640108_56_a
Kirito
640108_55_a
That's good to know. I think
I'll try to find one.
Asuna
640108_54_a
Your hiding skill will go WAY up
if you can get it!
Sphica
640108_53_a
Get an item called Kunoichi. It's
an outfit from the collab they did
with that Japanese-themed game!
Sphica
640108_52_a
Yui
640108_51_a
Kirito
640108_50_a
What's that?
Asuna
640108_49_a
There's a special trick to getting
super sneaky that I can tell you!
Sphica
640108_48_a
Tee-hee, okay!
Sphica
640108_47_a
Of course! You'll have to teach us
how to be as good at hiding as
you!
Asuna
640108_46_a
Huh? Really?
Sphica
640108_45_a
Well, how about playing
hide-and-seek with us from
now on instead of alone?
Kirito
640108_44_a
Yeah...
Kirito
640108_43_a
I guess she has a point...
Asuna
640108_42_a
There's so much more you can do
here than in the real world! It
makes hide-and-seek way more fun!
Sphica
640108_41_a
Nope! I always dive in by myself!
Sphica
640108_40_a
So you don't play with any of your
friends or family?
Kirito
640108_39_a
Because it's fun!
Sphica
640108_38_a
But why are you playing
hide-and-seek by yourself in ALO
anyway?
Kirito
640108_37_a
Tee-hee, no problem!
Sphica
640108_36_a
Asuna
640108_35_a
Yui
640108_34_a
You really helped us out, Sphica.
Thanks.
Kirito
640108_33_a
Hahaha, you got it.
Asuna
640108_32_a
Asuna
640108_31_a
Yui
640108_30_a
Ahem. Alright then, we'll just
pretend we never heard how
old she is!
Kirito
640108_29_a
Strea
640108_28_a
Well, it never stopped my sister
either...
Rain
640108_27_a
Kirito
640108_26_a
Asuna
640108_25_a
Strea, you can't say that!
Yui
640108_24_a
Rain
640108_23_a
Hahaha, the age restriction is
just for show anyway.
Strea
640108_22_a
Yui
640108_21_a
Hmmm... I wonder if we should
report her to the admins...
Asuna
640108_20_a
Kirito
640108_19_a
Yui
640108_18_a
Asuna
640108_17_a
Well, I'm eleven!
Sphica
640108_16_a
Yeah... You can't use the
AmuSphere if you're younger than
thirteen, just like the NervGear.
Kirito
640108_15_a
Kirito
640108_14_a
Asuna
640108_13_a
Hey, Daddy... Isn't she a little
young to be playing VRMMOs?
Yui
640108_12_a
Tee-hee-hee.
Sphica
640108_11_a
Hehe, that's for sure.
What a good girl!
Strea
640108_10_a
Strea
640108_9_a
Yeesh, this kid ended up being
more help than us this time!
Rain
640108_8_a
Yui
640108_7_a
Tee-hee!
Sphica
640108_6_a
It's all thanks to you, Sphica.
We never would have found him
without your help.
Kirito
640108_5_a
Yeah. And his account was
suspended, so we won't have to
worry about him anymore.
Asuna
640108_4_a
Kirito
640108_3_a
Asuna
640108_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
You must be so relieved we caught
that stalker, Mommy!
Yui
640108_1_a
Sphica, can you tell us more about
him?
Kirito
640107_62_a
But I'm the best at hide-and-seek,
so I saw him right away! Tee-hee.
Sphica
640107_61_a
He was always muttering something.
He was hiding too.
Sphica
640107_60_a
gasp
Asuna
640107_59_a
Oh, you mean that weird guy?
I see him all the time during
hide-and-seek.
Sphica
640107_58_a
It must have been someone else
stalking you, Asuna...
Kirito
640107_57_a
Asuna
640107_56_a
I knew it. Sphica's the one those
rumors were about. The player
skilled at hiding.
Kirito
640107_55_a
What are you talking about?
Strea
640107_54_a
Strea
640107_53_a
Huh...?
Rain
640107_52_a
I was only playing hide-and-seek
like I always do in ALO...
Sphica
640107_51_a
I-I wasn't following anyone!
Sphica
640107_50_a
Were you the one following me,
Sphica?
Asuna
640107_49_a
Imps are inherently good
at hiding, aren't they?
Kirito
640107_48_a
I'm Sphica... An Imp.
???
640107_47_a
Uh... H-Hi, I'm Asuna, an
Undine... What's your name?
Asuna
640107_46_a
Ugh!
What is WRONG with you!
???
640107_45_a
Gaaaaaah!
S-Sorry!
Kirito
640107_44_a
Kirito! Let go of her before you
violate the harassment code!
Asuna
640107_43_a
Asuna
640107_42_a
Kirito
640107_41_a
So what?! Let me go already!
???
640107_40_a
Strea
640107_39_a
Y-You're a girl?!
Rain
640107_38_a
Asuna
640107_37_a
Kirito
640107_36_a
Wh-Wha
What the heck are you doing!
???
640107_35_a
We finally caught the bad guy!
Wait... Huh?
Strea
640107_34_a
Strea
640107_33_a
Wooo, we got him!
Rain
640107_32_a
Kirito!
Asuna
640107_31_a
Gaaah!
???
640107_30_a
Gotcha!
Kirito
640107_29_a
I thought I was the one hiding
and they were the ones seeking!
???
640107_28_a
Where'd they go? We're still in
the middle of our game!
???
640107_27_a
Wait, what?
???
640107_26_a
Huh?
???
640107_25_a
...
???
640107_24_a
Got it!
Asuna
640107_23_a
Hopefully he'll take the bait...
Alright, Asuna, it's all you now.
Kirito
640107_22_a
Keep your eyes open, you two. If
we can't find him the normal way,
we'll have to lure him to us.
Kirito
640107_21_a
And I'll go over there!
Strea
640107_20_a
Strea
640107_19_a
Kirito
640107_18_a
Alright, then I'll hide out over
here and keep watch.
Rain
640107_17_a
O-Okay...
Asuna
640107_16_a
Strea
640107_15_a
Rain
640107_14_a
N-Never mind. We'll figure this
out before you know it.
Kirito
640107_13_a
But what?
Asuna
640107_12_a
I don't want you feeling unsafe
any longer, but...
Kirito
640107_9_a
Strea
640107_11_a
Rain
640107_10_a
But if he's some sort of stalker,
that makes this harassment.
Kirito
640107_8_a
Strea
640107_7_a
Rain
640107_6_a
Well, we have to do something. If
it's just hide-and-seek he's
playing, it's all in good fun.
Kirito
640107_5_a
C-Can we really catch that stalker
like this?
Asuna
640107_4_a
Strea
640107_3_a
Rain
640107_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Alright, everything's ready. Get
in position, guys!
Kirito
640107_1_a
Asuna
640105_39_a
Yui
640105_38_a
...
Kirito
640105_37_a
Ooh, maybe it's the same player as
the one we've been after!
Strea
640105_36_a
640105_35_a
Strea
640105_34_a
His hiding skill must be really
high if you couldn't find him,
Asuna...
Rain
640105_33_a
Wait, someone's stalking you?
Kirito
640105_32_a
And it wasn't the first time. It's
been happening a lot lately.
Asuna
640105_31_a
I got this weird feeling on that
solo quest I was doing, but when I
looked around, no one was there.
Asuna
640105_30_a
Yui
640105_29_a
What?
Kirito
640105_28_a
I think...
I think I'm being followed.
Asuna
640105_27_a
Huh? What is it, Asuna?
Did something happen?
Kirito
640105_26_a
Yui
640105_25_a
Kirito
640105_24_a
Kirito...
Asuna
640105_23_a
Yui
640105_22_a
Hey, speak of the devil.
Back already?
Kirito
640105_21_a
640105_20_a
640105_19_a
...
Asuna
640105_18_a
Yui
640105_17_a
Yeah.
Kirito
640105_16_a
Mommy has been doing a lot of
those new solo quests, hasn't she?
Yui
640105_15_a
Yui
640105_14_a
Oh, there was some other quest
she was going to work on. She said
she'd be right back.
Kirito
640105_13_a
Rain
640105_12_a
Hey... Wait a second.
Where's Asuna?
Strea
640105_11_a
This guy must have really strong
animal instincts...
Kirito
640105_10_a
It's like trying to find some
beast that's silently and patiently
lying in wait for its prey.
Kirito
640105_9_a
It probably doesn't even have
anything to do with his
skill level...
Yui
640105_8_a
Kirito
640105_7_a
He is REALLY good
at hiding...
Yui
640105_6_a
Well, our past ten or so attempts
of finding this player have turned
up squat.
Strea
640105_5_a
Strea
640105_4_a
Hahaha... This is totally getting
to you, isn't it, Kirito?
Rain
640105_3_a
Yui
640105_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Gaaaah!
Still no sign of...of anything!
Kirito
640105_1_a
I think so too... Anyway, we
should go check out this new
location.
Kirito
640103_51_a
Then there's no reason for him to
spread false information... So
this post must be true.
Asuna
640103_50_a
It's like he's just playing a
big game of hide-and-seek.
Kirito
640103_49_a
Something feels off... All the
info up until now points to him
hiding like this just for fun.
Kirito
640103_48_a
Yui
640103_47_a
Asuna
640103_46_a
That means whoever wrote this is
either the player himself or
a friend of his...
Kirito
640103_45_a
640103_44_a
Rain
640103_43_a
Yeah, that!
Strea
640103_42_a
Yui
640103_41_a
Asuna
640103_40_a
What? Like they're leading us
on a wild goose chase?
Kirito
640103_39_a
Or maybe it's not even true.
Strea
640103_38_a
640103_37_a
Rain
640103_36_a
Or maybe they're triangulating
his location from all the tracking
items everyone is using...
Strea
640103_35_a
Kirito
640103_34_a
Asuna
640103_33_a
I wonder if the person who wrote
this has cast a tracking spell
on that player...
Yui
640103_32_a
His new location isn't that
far from here.
Rain
640103_31_a
640103_30_a
Strea
640103_29_a
Ooh, there's a new post! Let's
see... It says our mystery player
has gone somewhere else.
Rain
640103_28_a
Yui
640103_27_a
Yeah. You can't post anonymously
to that bulletin board, so I really
thought we could trust that info...
Kirito
640103_26_a
We came here because of what we
read on the bulletin board, right?
Maybe we should take another look.
Asuna
640103_25_a
Or he might not even be here
anymore.
Yui
640103_24_a
Yui
640103_23_a
Asuna
640103_22_a
Either he's really well-hidden
or his skill level is through
the roof...or both.
Kirito
640103_21_a
So if even YOU can't sense
anything, that means...
Strea
640103_20_a
640103_19_a
Rain
640103_18_a
But the chances of it reacting go
up the higher your skill level,
right?
Strea
640103_17_a
Yui
640103_16_a
If a player's hiding skill is high
enough, sometimes the detection
skill doesn't even react to them.
Kirito
640103_15_a
Yui
640103_14_a
Asuna
640103_13_a
No, I'm not getting anything
right now.
Kirito
640103_12_a
Has your detection skill picked
up anything yet, Kirito?
Rain
640103_9_a
640103_11_a
Strea
640103_10_a
Yui
640103_8_a
Yeah, seems like it.
Kirito
640103_7_a
has turned into an unofficial
event of sorts. It's like everyone
is looking!
Yui
640103_6_a
With all the rumors flying around
about him, finding this player
Yui
640103_5_a
I think so.
Asuna
640103_4_a
Yui
640103_3_a
Asuna
640103_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
The latest rumors had that player
appearing around here, right?
Kirito
640103_1_a
Totally!
Strea
640101_49_a
640101_48_a
Strea
640101_47_a
Yeah!
Rain
640101_46_a
Yui
640101_45_a
Alright, you both ready?
Kirito
640101_44_a
Wait, I take that back. Maybe the
expert's point of view is exactly
what I need.
Kirito
640101_43_a
Yui
640101_42_a
Asuna
640101_41_a
Hold up, you two. Just because
you're experts at hiding doesn't
mean you'll be good at finding...
Kirito
640101_40_a
Same here! I'm the BEST at
sneaking!
Strea
640101_39_a
640101_38_a
Strea
640101_37_a
I want in too! Sneaking around
without people noticing me is
totally my thing!
Rain
640101_36_a
Yui
640101_35_a
Kirito
640101_34_a
Ahaha...
Asuna
640101_33_a
640101_32_a
Rain
640101_31_a
Totally! Rain and I had no trouble
finding you, after all.
Strea
640101_30_a
Yui
640101_29_a
Ha ha, yeah. I'm just more
inclined to find than to hide.
Kirito
640101_28_a
That's right, Daddy, you are
pretty skilled at detection.
Yui
640101_27_a
but if it's really a player, I'll
be able to tell right away.
Kirito
640101_26_a
Still, I'm curious. It's possible
it turns out to be just some event
the devs are setting up,
Kirito
640101_25_a
Yui
640101_24_a
Kirito
640101_23_a
N-No!
Asuna
640101_22_a
640101_21_a
Rain
640101_20_a
Ahaha, no, it's not. Everything is
a scary story to you, isn't it?
Strea
640101_19_a
Yui
640101_18_a
Kirito
640101_17_a
S-So this is a scary story?!
Asuna
640101_16_a
Urban legends like that just give
me the best sort of chills!
Rain
640101_15_a
640101_14_a
Strea
640101_13_a
Well, no one's even sure he
exists outside of the rumors.
Rain
640101_12_a
You both seem pretty interested
in this guy.
Asuna
640101_9_a
Yui
640101_11_a
Kirito
640101_10_a
Me too! No one's ever been able to
find him! How cool is that?
Strea
640101_8_a
640101_7_a
Strea
640101_6_a
Oh yeah, I've heard those rumors!
They really are something else.
Rain
640101_5_a
It seems to be all anyone can
talk about.
Yui
640101_4_a
Asuna
640101_3_a
Yui
640101_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
A player skilled at hiding?
Kirito
640101_1_a
Yeah!
Asuna
640098_23_a
The two of us can handle anything
the future throws at us. We WILL
beat this game.
Kirito
640098_22_a
That we're happy we met here...
Asuna
640098_21_a
Yeah... That'll be the first time
we can say it honestly.
Asuna
640098_20_a
Then we have to beat this game.
Kirito
640098_19_a
But if we really want to be able
to say that we're happy for it and
mean it...
Kirito
640098_18_a
That's true...
Asuna
640098_17_a
No, I feel the same way. The two
of us never would have met if we
hadn't gotten trapped in SAO.
Kirito
640098_16_a
Hehe, sorry, I shouldn't be
talking like this...
Asuna
640098_15_a
So maybe living in this place
isn't all that bad after all...
Asuna
640098_14_a
But this world helped her find a
reason to live, a goal for when
she gets back to the real world...
Asuna
640098_13_a
That's terrible...
Kirito
640098_12_a
Well...her husband died shortly
before she dived into SAO...
Asuna
640098_11_a
Like...?
Kirito
640098_10_a
She is... A lot happened to her in
the past...
Asuna
640098_9_a
She's such a nice person.
Kirito
640098_8_a
...
Asuna
640098_7_a
Bye-bye!
Rechka
640098_6_a
Come say hi any time!
Kirito
640098_5_a
Thank you, Rechka!
Asuna
640098_4_a
Kirito
640098_3_a
Asuna
640098_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
See you around! I wish you all
the happiness in the world!
Rechka
640098_1_a
Thank you...
Rechka
640097_25_a
Me too!
Asuna
640097_24_a
You should! I'd eat there all
the time!
Kirito
640097_23_a
If we ever get back to the real
world, I think I'd like to try
opening my own restaurant...
Rechka
640097_22_a
Oh, Rechka...
Asuna
640097_21_a
That's what's kept me going
these past two years...
Rechka
640097_20_a
But it makes me so happy when
people enjoy the food I cook them.
Rechka
640097_19_a
I could never make something like
this in the real world, no matter
how hard I tried.
Rechka
640097_18_a
Ha ha, not even. Cooking in VR has
been simplified in so many ways.
Rechka
640097_17_a
something this good at a
five-star restaurant in the
real world.
Kirito
640097_16_a
Not that I'm the best judge of
gourmet food, but even I know
that you could only get
Kirito
640097_15_a
I bet you're an astounding cook
in real life too.
Kirito
640097_14_a
I'm just happy you two like it.
There's plenty left, so have all
the seconds and thirds you like!
Rechka
640097_13_a
Rechka, your recipes are seriously
amazing...
Asuna
640097_12_a
Hehe, don't worry. I know what
you mean.
Asuna
640097_11_a
Th-That's not to say that what
you've cooked for me before wasn't
good too...!
Kirito
640097_10_a
I-I mean...!
Kirito
640097_9_a
Y-Yeah... Eating something this
delicious is just so utterly
indescribable...
Kirito
640097_8_a
Hehehe, too good for words?
Asuna
640097_7_a
Holy... Whoaaa...
Kirito
640097_6_a
...
Kirito
640097_5_a
This is...
Kirito
640097_4_a
Asuna

Rechka

bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
...!
Kirito
640097_1_a
Hehe, that goes without saying!
Asuna
640095_22_a
Though I'm afraid you're going
to have to help me, Asuna.
Rechka
640095_21_a
Of course! I'm going to make
something extra special to
celebrate the new couple.
Rechka
640095_20_a
Wait, you're going to cook for us?
Asuna
640095_19_a
Mind lending me a hand in the
kitchen, Asuna?
Rechka
640095_18_a
I see... You know, I can make
something really tasty with this.
Rechka
640095_17_a
Hehe, yeah.
Kirito
640095_16_a
You mean your fishing guru.
Asuna
640095_15_a
It's really thanks to that player
I was able to catch these fish.
Kirito
640095_14_a
It's certainly a good fishing spot,
but I learned how to fish from
someone who's highly skilled.
Kirito
640095_13_a
You've got some pretty good
ingredients here. Ooh, including
this rare fish!
Rechka
640095_12_a
Let's see...
Oho!
Rechka
640095_11_a
Let me open my inventory and I can
show you what I caught today...
Kirito
640095_10_a
What kind of fish can you catch
around here?
Rechka
640095_9_a
Thank you. Oh, I heard you were
out fishing earlier.
Rechka
640095_8_a
Well, in any case, make yourself
at home.
Kirito
640095_7_a
Hahaha, if you say so.
Rechka
640095_6_a
It hasn't been that long, but
you've already taught me so much.
I'd definitely call you a guru!
Asuna
640095_5_a
Ha ha, I don't think I'm qualified
to be anyone's "guru."
Rechka
640095_4_a
Asuna
640095_3_a
Rechka
640095_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
So you're Asuna's culinary guru.
Kirito
640095_1_a
I do!
Asuna
640093_20_a
R-Really?
Well, if you insist...
Rechka
640093_19_a
Then we can cook together!
Asuna
640093_18_a
Th-That's not what I meant! I was
hoping you'd stay the night!
Asuna
640093_17_a
No worries. I understand what it's
like to be a newlywed. I won't
overstay my welcome.
Rechka
640093_16_a
Sorry, he should be home soon...
Asuna
640093_15_a
O-Oh, Kirito? He went fishing at
the lake near here...
Asuna
640093_14_a
Speaking of your husband,
where is he?
Rechka
640093_13_a
Wow, thank you so much!
Asuna
640093_12_a
I made these using a special
recipe of mine. You and your
husband should eat them together.
Rechka
640093_11_a
Ha ha, I know! Here, take this.
It's your wedding present.
Rechka
640093_10_a
Hehe, you're absolutely right.
The way to a man's heart really
is through his stomach!
Asuna
640093_9_a
That made me so happy! It's like
I got to play Cupid or something!
Rechka
640093_8_a
When I got your message, I just
knew you'd won that boy's heart
using the recipe I taught you.
Rechka
640093_7_a
Hehe, thank you.
Asuna
640093_6_a
Chefs of a feather flock
together, after all.
Rechka
640093_5_a
Of course! Like I'd find out you
got married and decide not to
come see you!
Rechka
640093_4_a
Hi, Rechka! Thanks for meeting me
here!
Asuna
640093_3_a
Asuna
640093_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Hey, Asuna!
Rechka
640093_1_a
Uh...?
Kirito
640091_18_a
Hehehe, it's a secret.
Asuna
640091_17_a
Wait, what thank-you present?
Kirito
640091_16_a
That reminds me. I should go give
her that thank-you present and
tell her we got married...
Asuna
640091_15_a
Oh yeah...?
Kirito
640091_14_a
to make soy sauce.
Asuna
640091_13_a
She's the one who taught me how
to use sag leaves
Asuna
640091_12_a
A woman named Rechka.
Asuna
640091_11_a
What? Who?
Kirito
640091_10_a
Hmm... Well, I do.
Asuna
640091_9_a
Really?
Asuna
640091_8_a
I don't know anyone who's a better
cook than you, Asuna.
Kirito
640091_7_a
It's not brownnosing! I'm telling
you the truth, honest.
Kirito
640091_6_a
Okay, okay, that's enough
brownnosing for one day.
Asuna
640091_5_a
And this too! The flavor, the
texture
it's perfect!
Kirito
640091_4_a
Hehe, thanks.
Asuna
640091_3_a
Asuna
640091_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Mmm, this is delicious!
Kirito
640091_1_a
You're welcome. I'm looking
forward to my White Day present,
hehe.
Asuna
640088_20_a
O-Okay... Well, anyway, really,
thank you.
Kirito
640088_19_a
Nothing! I didn't say anything!
Asuna
640088_18_a
Wh-What was that?
Kirito
640088_17_a
Insensitive jerk...
Asuna
640088_16_a
S-Sorry! I didn't mean it that
way!
Kirito
640088_15_a
I-If you're going to be rude about
it, then I'm taking it back!
Asuna
640088_14_a
You should've saved yourself the
trouble and just given it to me
when it was finished...
Kirito
640088_13_a
Were you really worrying that much
about when to give this to me?
Kirito
640088_12_a
Th-Thank you, Asuna... Ha ha,
I totally forgot about
Valentine's Day...
Kirito
640088_11_a
You're always there to help me
out, so even though it's only VR,
I wanted to make you something.
Asuna
640088_10_a
Hehe, but it's only to say thank
you, okay?
Asuna
640088_9_a
Th-That's right, it's February...
which means Valentine's Day...
Kirito
640088_8_a
Ehehe, yeah.
Asuna
640088_7_a
But why chocolate...?
Oh!
Kirito
640088_6_a
Y-Yeah... I had some time between
tasks for the quest...
Asuna
640088_5_a
Ch-Chocolate?! Did you make this
yourself?
Kirito
640088_4_a

Um... For this...
Here...
Asuna
640088_3_a
Asuna
640088_2_a
bg_03_forest1_sunset
For what?
Kirito
640088_1_a
Yeah...
Asuna
640087_19_a
The...timing...?
Kirito
640087_18_a
I just...couldn't work out the
timing right...
Asuna
640087_17_a
No, it's not that...
Asuna
640087_16_a
So I figured maybe you're in some
sort of trouble or something.
Kirito
640087_15_a
You never mess up like that during
a fight normally...
Kirito
640087_14_a
Well... You just seem kind of out
of it today.
Kirito
640087_13_a
Huh?
Asuna
640087_12_a
Really, it's no problem. But...
is there something bothering you?
Kirito
640087_11_a
Sorry I wasn't much help back
there, Kirito...
Asuna
640087_10_a
Phew... That did it...
Kirito
640087_9_a
Gwaaaah!

RRRAAAAHHH!
Kirito

No worries! I can take him down
with a power play!
Kirito
640087_6_a
I didn't think it'd parry me!
Asuna
640087_5_a
Y-Yeah...
Sorry...

640087_4_a
Asuna, are you okay?!

to me.

R-Right.

W-Well, this butter won't move
itself. Come on.
Asuna

N-Nope, nothing at all...

You got it.

Now then, here is your next task.

Uh... You mean February...?

I just remembered what time of
year it is in the real world...

What is it?
Kirito
640085_7_a
Yeah...
Hey, Kirito...
Asuna
640085_6_a
Well, I guess this kind of thing
is less life-threatening...
Kirito
640085_5_a
Hehe, I think it'd be fun. It's
exhausting just fighting all
the time.

making...

640083_21_a
We decorated the town like this so
all who visit can bask in the
luscious glory of chocolate!
NPC
640083_20_a
Chocolate?
Kirito
640083_19_a
Kirito
640083_18_a
Asuna
640083_17_a
Hello there! Welcome to Cacao Town,
home of the chocolate makers!
NPC
640083_16_a
We should ask around.
Kirito
640083_15_a
There's got to be some explanation
for why this place looks the way
it does.
Asuna
640083_14_a
Look at all those gingerbread
houses...
Kirito
640083_13_a
Ha ha, yeah. It's like we wandered
right into Hansel and Gretel.
Asuna
640083_12_a
I can't believe a place like this
exists in Aincrad...
Kirito
640083_11_a
Wow!
Asuna
640083_10_a
bg_event_valentine
Whoa...
Kirito
640083_9_a
Anyway, let's get out of here.
Kirito
640083_8_a
M-Me too...
Asuna
640083_7_a
I wonder why she looked straight
at us when she said that...
Kirito
640083_6_a
Argo did wish everyone luck when
we paired off to head to the next
town...
Kirito
640083_5_a
It's a little worrying that we can
only keep going in parties of two
from here on out.
Asuna
640083_4_a
Y-Yeah. I hope we'll be okay...
Asuna
640083_3_a
Asuna
640083_2_a
bg_02_forest
We'll be there once we get out
of this forest.
Kirito
640083_1_a
Nehehe...
Argo
640081_21_a
Come on, Argo, just spit it out
already.
Kirito
640081_20_a
Yup. I got the info after talkin'
to a buncha NPCs.
Argo
640081_19_a
Really...?
Asuna
640081_18_a
There's one last obstacle between
us 'n' the floor boss, and it's
gonna be harder'n normal!
Argo
640081_17_a
Tch...! Yer all takin' this quest
way too lightly!
Argo
640081_16_a
Cool.
Kirito
640081_15_a
In any case, we're this close to
wrapping up this quest now thanks
to you.
Agil
640081_14_a
R-Right.
Asuna
640081_13_a
We hardly practice at all, really.
Right, Asuna?
Kirito
640081_12_a
I bet ya practice fer like thirty
hours a day!
Argo
640081_11_a
It's crazy how good ya time yer
switches!
Argo
640081_10_a
Kirito
640081_9_a
Nice job, you two.
Agil
640081_8_a
Woo hoo!
Asuna
640081_7_a
Asuna
640081_6_a
Alright, that's the last of the
small-fry around here.
Kirito
640081_5_a
Gaaahh!
Monster
640081_4_a
Switch!
Take this!
Asuna
640081_3_a
Asuna
640081_2_a
bg_02_forest
Hyaaaa!
Kirito
640081_1_a
はは、そうか
キリト
640078_20_a
ふふっ、伊達にキリトくんの
パートナーを続けてないからね～
アスナ
640078_19_a
おおっ……確かにそうだな
まさかアスナにゲームうんちくで
一本取られるとは思わなかったぜ
キリト
640078_18_a
まあ需要あるものほど
レアリティ高くするのも、
ゲームの醍醐味だけどね
アスナ
640078_17_a
そういう需要もあると思うけど
キリト
640078_16_a
初夢ポーションって
正月に限定しないで
いつでも配布すればいいのにな
キリト
640078_15_a
もう一つ見られる世界がある
それがきっと寝てるときに見る
思い出の世界……夢だからね
アスナ
640078_14_a
そうだね
現実ではもう無い光景は
仮想世界でも見られるけど……
アスナ
640078_13_a
故郷の景色が……
キリト
640078_12_a
ふふっ、そうか
でもアスナのお母さん
見られるといいな……
キリト
640078_11_a
エリカのアバター使って、
独りで街の宿屋に行っちゃったよ
アスナ
640078_10_a
なんかキリトくんや他の子たちと
会うのが気恥ずかしかったみたい
アスナ
640078_9_a
てっきりお母さんを
連れてくるのかと……
キリト
640078_8_a
急に戻るってメッセが来たから、
キリト
640078_7_a
もう今日はダイブしないのかと
思ってたけど、
キリト
640078_6_a
ふふっ、やっぱりバレてたんだね
わたしが初夢ポーションを
渡したい相手が誰か……
アスナ
640078_5_a
あれ……アスナのお母さんは?
キリト
640078_4_a
うん、ただいま
キリトくん
アスナ
640078_3_a
アスナ
640078_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
お帰り、アスナ
キリト
640078_1_a
キリト
640077_13_a
ありがとうキリトくん……
じゃあ早速行ってくるね
アスナ
640077_12_a
まあ、家族の話もしてたし、
なんとなく、な
キリト
640077_11_a
キリトくん……ふふっ
その感じだと誰に渡すのかまで
お見通しなんだね
アスナ
640077_10_a
それを使ってほしい相手に
早く渡したいんじゃないかって
思ってたんだ
キリト
640077_9_a
なんかさっき初夢ポーションを
渡してからのアスナが、
落ち着きなかったろ?
キリト
640077_8_a
えっ!?
アスナ
640077_7_a
アスナ……
そろそろログアウトしたいんじゃ
ないのか?
キリト
640077_6_a
これもキリトくんのおかげだよ
ありがとう……
アスナ
640077_5_a
良かったな、アスナ
キリト
640077_4_a
うん!
報酬のお正月用振袖装備も
無事にゲットしたよ!
アスナ
640077_3_a
アスナ
640077_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
よし!
ボスを倒したぞ!
キリト
640077_1_a
……?
キリト
640075_22_a
ちょっとそれを飲んでほしい
人がいるんだ!
アスナ
640075_21_a
あ、ああ
もちろん……
キリト
640075_20_a
キリトくん
やっぱりその初夢ポーション、
もらっちゃってもいいかな?
アスナ
640075_19_a
アスナ?
キリト
640075_18_a
あっ……でもそれなら……!
アスナ
640075_17_a
そうかもね、ふふっ
アスナ
640075_16_a
仮想世界の夢は現実を見せる
特別な力を備えてるのかも……
なんてな
キリト
640075_15_a
そうだな
仮想の反対は現実……
夢の反対も現実なんだとしたら……
キリト
640075_14_a
キリト
640075_13_a
……ふふっ、でもあの頃見た夢が
現実になるってなんだか嬉しいな
アスナ
640075_12_a
す、スミマセン……
キリト
640075_11_a
も、も～～っ!
そんな余計なことに
感づかなくてもいいの!!
アスナ
640075_10_a
アスナってもしかして
あの頃から俺を……?
キリト
640075_9_a
えっ!?
アスナ
640075_8_a
でもあのポーションを飲んだ頃って
まだ俺たち結婚もしてなかったよな?
キリト
640075_7_a
そうだったんだな……
あれ?
キリト
640075_6_a
だからわたしは夢は叶ったの
もう初夢とかに頼ったりしなくても
十分なんだよ
アスナ
640075_5_a
アスナ……
キリト
640075_4_a
現実世界でキリトくんと
出会うってことだったんだ
アスナ
640075_3_a
キリト
640075_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
SAOであのポーションを飲んで
見た夢……それはね
アスナ
640075_1_a
ふふっ、今教えてあげるよ
アスナ
640073_24_a
そう言えばそうだったな……
ええと、でもそれと今の会話に
どういう関係が……?
キリト
640073_23_a
SAOであのポーションを使った時、
見た夢の内容をキリトくんに
教えてあげなかったでしょ?
アスナ
640073_22_a
えっ?
どういう意味だ?
キリト
640073_21_a
ううん、わたしは要らないよ
わたしの夢は……もう叶ったから
アスナ
640073_20_a
かもな
アスナ、欲しいのか?
欲しいならあげるけど……
キリト
640073_19_a
機能としては同じような感じかな
アスナ
640073_18_a
そう言えばあったな
レム睡眠になりやすい状態を作り、
夢を見させるっていう……
キリト
640073_17_a
かもって……なんか適当だね
ああ、でもそう言えばSAOでも
そんなアイテムあったね
アスナ
640073_16_a
説明文によると、
これを飲んで仮想世界で寝ると、
初夢が見られる……かもだそうだ
キリト
640073_15_a
ええと、どんな効果があるの?
アスナ
640073_14_a
……《初夢ポーション》だってさ
キリト
640073_13_a
item_event_dream_portion
さっき手に入れたこれなんかも、
正月アイテムなんだろうな……
キリト
640073_12_a
ドロップする素材やアイテムも、
なんかお正月に関連するものが
多いね
アスナ
640073_11_a
それにしてもお正月の準備用の
クエストなだけあって、
アスナ
640073_10_a
はは……ここで十分、
息抜きさせてもらうよ
キリト
640073_9_a
キリトくん、いつも高難度クエスト
ばっかり挑戦してるからね～
アスナ
640073_8_a
そんなこと気にしなくてもいいさ
こういうのんびりできるのも
たまにやると楽しいもんだろ
キリト
640073_7_a
キリトくん、付き合わせちゃって
ごめんね
アスナ
640073_6_a
これならわたし一人でも
クリアできたのかな?
アスナ
640073_5_a
この振袖が報酬になってる
クエスト……今のところ
そんなに大変じゃないよね
アスナ
640073_4_a
ああ、ここはそんなに
難易度は高くないはずだ
キリト
640073_3_a
キリト
640073_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
次はこのダンジョンだね
アスナ
640073_1_a
あっ、そうそう
それなんだけどね……
アスナ
640071_21_a
で、アスナが欲しいやつは
どんなクエストをこなせば
いいんだ?
キリト
640071_20_a
うん、そうだね……
アスナ
640071_19_a
まあどっちも本心ってことだろう
ありがたい反面若干の煩わしさも
あるのが、血縁だからな
キリト
640071_18_a
無意識には褒めてくれることが
嬉しかったのかなあって……
アスナ
640071_17_a
そうなんだけど……
そういうのに反抗してたわりに、
アスナ
640071_16_a
はは、別にいいじゃないか
一年経って成長した姿を見てもらう
機会なわけだし
キリト
640071_15_a
なんかこの振袖の選ぶ基準が、
大人に褒めてほしいっていう受けを
狙ってるみたいって気づいて……
アスナ
640071_14_a
だってわたしいつも現実だと
お正月は京都で親戚と集まってるって
言ってるでしょ……
アスナ
640071_13_a
えっ?
突然なんでため息?
キリト
640071_12_a
ああっ……
アスナ
640071_11_a
item_event_kimono
この花柄のやつかな
可愛らしさと気品を兼ねてるって
感じがするでしょ
アスナ
640071_10_a
アスナはどれがいいんだ?
キリト
640071_9_a
それぞれが報酬になってる
クエストも別に用意されてる
らしいんだ
アスナ
640071_8_a
うん、そうなんだ
柄の違う振袖がいくつかあってね
アスナ
640071_7_a
正月も近いし、
こういう季節物装備を
報酬にしてるんだな
キリト
640071_6_a
これは……おお
振袖装備をもらえるクエストか
キリト
640071_5_a
今度このクエストに
付き合ってもらっていいかな?
アスナ
640071_4_a
ん、どうしたんだ?
キリト
640071_3_a
キリト
640071_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
キリトくん、キリトくん
アスナ
640071_1_a
あはは、そうかもしれないね!
アスナ
640068_15_a
そうか……はは
ペアルックだとなんか追加報酬とか
もらえるかもしれないしな
キリト
640068_14_a
今度はわたしも一緒に
人気者になるの、ふふっ
アスナ
640068_13_a
うん、
キリトくんばっかり人気者になって、
羨ましかったから、
アスナ
640068_12_a
あそこに行くと
子供たちに囲まれて……
キリト
640068_11_a
ええっ?
またあそこ行くのか?
キリト
640068_10_a
じゃあ早速これを着て、
主街区に戻ろうよ
アスナ
640068_9_a
そ、そうか……
はは、嬉しいよ
キリト
640068_8_a
わたしはキリトくんと
お揃いになりたかったの!
アスナ
640068_7_a
えと……可愛いとは思うけど、
そうじゃなくて……
ほら、さっき言ったでしょ?
アスナ
640068_6_a
アスナ、
そんなにサンタ服が好きだったのか?
キリト
640068_5_a
ふふっ、嬉しいな～
アスナ
640068_4_a
ホントに男物のサンタ衣装を
水面に映すことが条件
だったんだな……
キリト
640068_3_a
キリト
640068_2_a
item_event_santa_asuna
bg_18_mountain_snow
あっ!
やったよ、女子用サンタ服
ゲットだよ!
アスナ
640068_1_a
はは、じゃあ早く試してみよう
キリト
640067_18_a
きっとそうなんだよ!
うん、期待が持てそう!
アスナ
640067_17_a
同じエリアで対となる装備を手に入れ
られる手段として用意されてる
ってのは、確かにしっくり来るな
キリト
640067_16_a
俺のサンタ衣装を手に入れ
られたのがこの階層ってことを
考えると、
キリト
640067_15_a
うーん……
ちょっと強引な気もするけど、
キリト
640067_14_a
男物の服なら、
その反対は女物の服……
理に適ってる気がしない?
アスナ
640067_13_a
まあ……そうだな
キリト
640067_12_a
だって男の反対って、女でしょ?
アスナ
640067_11_a
えっ?
どうして?
キリト
640067_10_a
キリトくんのサンタ衣装を
水面に映して、女子用のサンタ衣装を
手に入れられないかな?
アスナ
640067_9_a
もしかしたら……
アスナ
640067_8_a
ああ……まだ結論が出てなかったな
キリト
640067_7_a
そうだね……さっきから
《対照的な物がもらえる》ってトコが
ちょっと気になってたんだけどさ……
アスナ
640067_6_a
そうか、もう少しの辛抱だ
NPCによるとこの先に
《凍れる鏡の泉》があるはずだ
キリト
640067_5_a
う、うん
ちょっとだけね……
アスナ
640067_4_a
どうした、アスナ
寒いか?
キリト
640067_3_a
キリト
640067_2_a
bg_07_snow_mountain
ねえ、キリトくん
アスナ
640067_1_a
よし、そうするか
キリト
640065_27_a
気になるね
ちょっと探してみようよ
アスナ
640065_26_a
ああ、もしかしたら泉も
凍ってるかもしれないな
キリト
640065_25_a
なるほど……
でも今はこの階層全体が
冬モードになってるから……
アスナ
640065_24_a
いや見つけたらしいんだが、
鏡が凍ってなかったみたいなんだ
キリト
640065_23_a
その泉を見つけられなかったの?
アスナ
640065_22_a
結局旧SAOでは実際にアイテムを
入手したプレイヤーはいなかった
キリト
640065_21_a
ああ、当時俺も気になったよ
鉄の剣を映したら鉄の盾がもらえる
とか、色々想像してたけど……
キリト
640065_20_a
対照的……って
どういうことなんだろう?
アスナ
640065_19_a
ただその泉は落とした品物の
《対照的な》アイテムが
もらえるんだってさ
キリト
640065_18_a
はは、まあ元ネタはそれだろうな
キリト
640065_17_a
普通の斧を泉に落としたら
金と銀の斧をもらえるとか、
そんな感じ?
アスナ
640065_16_a
そこにアイテムを映すと
別のアイテムを手に入れられるって
話でさ
キリト
640065_15_a
そこは冬場になると泉の水面が凍って
まるでそれが鏡のようになって……
キリト
640065_14_a
ああ、実際に行ったわけじゃ
ないんだが……この階層のどこかに
そういう場所があったらしい
キリト
640065_13_a
《凍れる鏡の泉》?
アスナ
640065_12_a
確かSAOのこの階層で
《凍れる鏡の泉》って話を
聞いたことを思い出したんだ
キリト
640065_11_a
水面が凍る……で思い出したん
だけど、
キリト
640065_10_a
キリトくん、どうしたの?
アスナ
640065_9_a
……ん?
キリト
640065_8_a
確かにそうだな……
キリト
640065_7_a
これだけ雪が降ると
気温も下がって……
河の水面も凍っちゃいそうだけどね
アスナ
640065_6_a
そうだね
アスナ
640065_5_a
この新生アインクラッドだと
がっつり降ってくれるんだな
サービス旺盛で良いよな、はは
キリト
640065_4_a
ああ……
SAOのときはお試し程度の降雪
だったけど、
キリト
640065_3_a
キリト
640065_2_a
bg_07_snow_mountain
ヨフェル城の雪景色も綺麗
だったけど……主街区……
水辺の街の雪景色も見惚れちゃうよね
アスナ
640065_1_a
う、うん……
そうだね!
アスナ
640063_21_a
裁縫スキルを持たないプレイヤーでも
手に入れる方法……
それがないか考えてみようぜ
キリト
640063_20_a
そ、それはそうだけど……
アスナ
640063_19_a
まったく手に入らなくなるっていう
状況は、運営の本意じゃない
はずだろ?
キリト
640063_18_a
女性版の衣装もきっとなにかの
報酬としてあるはずなんだ
キリト
640063_17_a
これも一つのクエストって考えるんだ
男物のサンタ衣装だって、こうして
運良く手に入れられたわけだから、
キリト
640063_16_a
キリトくん?
アスナ
640063_15_a
いや諦めるのはまだ早いぜ
キリト
640063_14_a
アスナ……
キリト
640063_13_a
せっかくサンタキリトくんと
お揃いになりたかったのにな～
アスナ
640063_12_a
ああ、粗製乱造じゃないけど、
あまりにも作りやすいとレアリティも
なくなっちまうのはわかるけどな……
キリト
640063_11_a
まあ本心はイベントクエの報酬とかで
使いたいんだろうね
アスナ
640063_10_a
裁縫スキルの高いプレイヤーに
サンタ衣装生成を控えるように
お達しがかかるなんてな……
キリト
640063_9_a
作りやすさと親しみやすさもあって、
自作する人が多くなると思った
運営から、
キリト
640063_8_a
サンタ衣装はこの時期メジャーな衣装
キリト
640063_7_a
運営からの依頼かぁ……
アスナ
640063_6_a
うーん……
そんなこともあるんだな
キリト
640063_5_a
どうしたんだ?
キリト
640063_4_a
………………
アスナ
640063_3_a
アスナ
640063_2_a
bg_event_tree_snow_christmas
おっ……どうだった?
サンタ衣装作ってくれそうか?
キリト
640063_1_a
うん!
アスナ
640061_21_a
あの人って確か
裁縫スキルカンストしてるんだよな
そうだな……行ってみるか
キリト
640061_20_a
あっ、そう言えばそうだね
じゃあ……
アシュレイさんに頼んでみよっか!
アスナ
640061_19_a
裁縫スキルの高いプレイヤーとかに
頼めば、普通に作って
くれそうなもんだけど……
キリト
640061_18_a
うーん……
でもこの服ってデザイン的には
そんなに凝ったもんでもないだろ?
キリト
640061_17_a
キリトくんだけ
子供たちにモテモテなんて、
なんか嫉妬しちゃうもん
アスナ
640061_16_a
うん!
アスナ
640061_15_a
アスナも着てみたくなったのか?
キリト
640061_14_a
そうだね
でもそのサンタ衣装って女子用は
ないのかな?
アスナ
640061_13_a
まあこの衣装には
子供NPCを集める効果があるとか、
ガチで設定してる可能性はあるな
キリト
640061_12_a
ホントホント!
アスナ
640061_11_a
ほ、ホントかぁ……?
キリト
640061_10_a
今回もNPCの子供に
こんなに好かれてる
うんうん、きっと人徳なんだよ
アスナ
640061_9_a
そんなことないよ
前のブラックサンタイベントでも
現実の子供たちに人気だったし、
アスナ
640061_8_a
いやそれはこの格好をしてる
からで……
キリト
640061_7_a
あはは、キリトくん
新生アインクラッド4層の主街区でも
子供たちに大人気だね
アスナ
640061_6_a
うおっ……
キリト
640061_5_a
ホントだ!
サンタだ、サンタだ～!
640061_4_a
アスナ
640061_3_a
キリト
640061_2_a
bg_event_tree_snow_christmas
わーっ、おにいちゃんサンタだ!
640061_1_a
はは、それもそうだな
キリト
640048_22_a
今日みたいな体験をした人って、
そうそういないはずでしょ?
セブン
640048_21_a
このALOという仮想世界で遊ぶ
プレイヤーは山のようにいるけど、
セブン
640048_20_a
ええ、あたしも偶然とはいえ、
開発者たちとコンタクト取れたのは
楽しかったわ!
セブン
640048_19_a
ううん、こういうのも楽しいよ
ね、セブン?
レイン
640048_18_a
ああ、いいぜ
でも二人とも……今日はなんの
成果もなしでなんか悪かったな
キリト
640048_17_a
そしたら今度は二人も手伝ってね!
あたし達も欲しいから!
セブン
640048_16_a
それだけちゃんとした装備なんだから
きっとALOでも
そのうち実装されると思うぜ
キリト
640048_15_a
う、うん
でもなんかごめんね、
わたしだけもらっちゃって……
アスナ
640048_14_a
アスナちゃん、
後で着て見せてよ!
レイン
640048_13_a
うわぁ……改めて見ると
その装備すごく可愛いね!
なんかホントの乙姫サマみたいだよ!
レイン
640048_12_a
……なら最後まで
遊んでくれた駄賃代わりに
この装備をくれたってこと?
アスナ
640048_11_a
まぁでもMMOでマップが
修正されたり追加や削除されることは
珍しくないし、仕方ないさ
キリト
640048_10_a
なんかザンネンだね
キリト君たちが
ここまで攻略したのに……
レイン
640048_9_a
検討の結果、このエリア一帯が
削除されることになったのかも
しれないな……
キリト
640048_8_a
わたし達に島から出ろって
言ってたけど……
レイン
640048_7_a
そうね
高い知能を持ったAIでも、
あんな流暢には話せないわ、普通
セブン
640048_6_a
NPCアバターを借りて、
俺たちに直接話しかけてきたんだ
キリト
640048_5_a
みんなも気づいただろうけど
あれは開発側の人間だな
キリト
640048_4_a
セブン
640048_3_a
キリト
640048_2_a
bg_18_tower_road_sunset
ねえ、キリトくん
さっきの村人さんって……
アスナ
640048_1_a
ああ、あんたに似合いそうだ
640047_25_a
えっ?
わ、わたしに?
アスナ
640047_24_a
悪いな
ああ、でもせっかくここまで
来てくれたんだから、これをやろう
640047_23_a
神様に言われたんじゃ仕方ないさ
キリト
640047_22_a
でもキリトくん……いいの?
アスナ
640047_21_a
みんな、そろそろ帰ろう
ここにいても仕方がないみたいだ
キリト
640047_20_a
なるほど、そういうこと……
セブン
640047_19_a
キリト君?
レイン
640047_18_a
あんたまさか……
いや……そうか、わかった
キリト
640047_17_a
さあて……どうしてだろうな
神様の思し召し……かな
640047_16_a
なんでそんなことを知ってるんだ?
キリト
640047_15_a
だからあんた達も
そろそろ帰った方がいい
640047_14_a
この島はもうじきなくなる
役目を終えるんだよ
640047_13_a
……?
アスナ
640047_12_a
はは、さっきはそう言ったが、
実は言い忘れてたことがあったんだ
640047_11_a
つまりお決まりのセリフしか
言わないAIのないNPC……
キリト
640047_10_a
確か「この村には昔ニエルドって
若者がいたんだけど、突然行方不明に
なった」とかなんとか……
セブン
640047_9_a
でもおかしいわ
さっき話しかけたときは、
同じ台詞しか言わなかったもの
セブン
640047_8_a
う、うん
地上を散策してるときに、
村で見かけたよ
レイン
640047_7_a
えっ?
この人……NPCだよね
アスナ
640047_6_a
……!
キリト
640047_5_a
レイン
640047_4_a
アスナ
640047_3_a
キリト
640047_2_a
bg_event_seashore
あんた達は……
大陸の方からやってきたみたいだな
640047_1_a
もしくは……
キリト
640045_24_a
そう考えるしかないって
思っちゃうよね
レイン
640045_23_a
強そうな敵もいなくて、
クエストを依頼するNPCもいない
めぼしいオブジェクトもない……
レイン
640045_22_a
ってことは今クエストも、
中断中ってことなのかな?
レイン
640045_21_a
ああ、告知もないしな
キリト
640045_20_a
うーん……キリト君は
ここは自動生成でできたエリアだって
思ってるんだよね
セブン
640045_19_a
人が住んでるのも、
あの漁村だけみたいだし
レイン
640045_18_a
うん……
特に変わったことはなかったかな
レイン
640045_17_a
二人は地上の調査どうだった?
アスナ
640045_16_a
ふふっ、いいわね
謎が謎を呼んでるって感じね
なかなか面白いわよ～
セブン
640045_15_a
そうなんだ……
レイン
640045_14_a
ネットを見てても、俺たち以外に
あのクエストを体験した
プレイヤーがいないみたいなんだ
キリト
640045_13_a
多分無理だ
キリト
640045_12_a
竜宮城の位置を確認する
意味も込めて
レイン
640045_11_a
じゃあわたしとセブンで
そのクエストを受けてみるとか
どうかな?
レイン
640045_10_a
いや合ってたと思うぞ
あのクエスト後には行けなくなる
仕様なのかもな
キリト
640045_9_a
う、うん……今回は廃墟どころか、
跡形もなくなってたんだ……
場所を間違えたのかな……?
アスナ
640045_8_a
えっ!?
前はあったんでしょ?
セブン
640045_7_a
それが……
その……無くなってたんだよ
アスナ
640045_6_a
竜宮城の調査はどうだった?
レイン
640045_5_a
ああ、ただいま
キリト
640045_4_a
キリト
640045_3_a
アスナ
640045_2_a
bg_event_seashore
キリト君にアスナちゃん!
お帰り～!
セブン
640045_1_a
はは……仕方ない
じゃあ海底はアスナと俺だけで
行くことにするよ
キリト
640043_35_a
まずは地上を調査するのが
先決だと思うのよ!
セブン
640043_34_a
ち、違うのよ!
そんなことでこの天才科学者が
嫌がるわけないでしょ!?
セブン
640043_33_a
あらら……そうだったんだ
アスナ
640043_32_a
まあわたしもあんまり
自信はないんだけどね……
レイン
640043_31_a
セブン
あんた泳げないだけでしょ
レイン
640043_30_a
それにここはフロンティアなんだから
陸にしましょーよ!
海は後回し!
セブン
640043_29_a
反対反対!
ALOは空を飛び回る
ゲームだよ!
セブン
640043_28_a
って、セブンどうしたんだ
気分でも悪いのか?
キリト
640043_27_a
………………
セブン
640043_26_a
ああ、あの辺はまだ調査しがいが……
キリト
640043_25_a
この前のクエストでは
既に朽ちてる感じだったけどね
アスナ
640043_24_a
この周辺の海底に
竜宮城……のような
お城があるんだよ
アスナ
640043_23_a
う、う、海!?
な、なんで!?
セブン
640043_22_a
うーん、そうだな
早速で悪いんだけど、
海に潜ってみないか?
キリト
640043_21_a
で、今日は具体的に
どの辺を探索するの?
レイン
640043_20_a
ああ、心強いぜ
キリト
640043_19_a
さすがセブンちゃん
まさに知的探求心の塊って感じ
アスナ
640043_18_a
研究しがいがあるじゃない!
セブン
640043_17_a
ふぅん、興味あるわ
まさにALOのフロンティアって
ことよね!
セブン
640043_16_a
モチーフが古代の日本っぽくて、
ALOの中でもかなり異質なんだよ
キリト
640043_15_a
俺たちもここには
まだ一回しか来たことがないんだ
キリト
640043_14_a
でもこの島、なぁに?
こんな場所があったなんて、
セブンちゃん全然知らなかったわ
セブン
640043_13_a
そうだったんだね
アスナ
640043_12_a
実はちょうど
二人でダイブして遊んでたんだ
レイン
640043_11_a
うん……確かにわたし達姉妹って
けっこうなレアキャラだよねぇ～
レイン
640043_10_a
レインもあんまりダイブできないって
言ってただろ?
キリト
640043_9_a
セブンは普段アメリカ在住だし、
キリト
640043_8_a
あはは……実はそうなんだよ
二人が来てくれたことが、
むしろ一番驚いたけどね
アスナ
640043_7_a
あれ?
もしかして集まったのって、
この四人だけなの……?
セブン
640043_6_a
二人とも、急な呼び出しに
応じてくれて助かるよ
キリト
640043_5_a
ハロー、キリト君
アスナちゃん
セブン
640043_4_a
キリト
640043_3_a
アスナ
640043_2_a
bg_event_seashore
プリヴィエート!
レイン
640043_1_a
あの二人?
キリト
640041_22_a
えっ!?
わあ、なんだか意外!
あの二人が来られるって!
アスナ
640041_21_a
あっ、また返事が……
これは……
アスナ
640041_20_a
うーん……
キリト
640041_19_a
どうする?
また今度にする?
アスナ
640041_18_a
えっ? そうなのか……
やっぱ急過ぎたか
参ったな……
キリト
640041_17_a
キリトくん、どうしよう
まだ全員から返事は戻ってないけど、
今の所誰も来れそうもないみたい
アスナ
640041_16_a
どうした、アスナ?
キリト
640041_15_a
あらら……
アスナ
640041_14_a
ああ、頼むよ
キリト
640041_13_a
そうだね
じゃあとりあえず
みんなに連絡しておくね
アスナ
640041_12_a
あの島はまだ未踏破エリアが多い
いきなり強い敵が出てくる
危険もあるだろ?
キリト
640041_11_a
ええと……
突発でどれくらい集まってくれるか
わからないけど、多い方がいいな
キリト
640041_10_a
メンバーは誰を誘う?
アスナ
640041_9_a
なるほどな
じゃあそうするか
キリト
640041_8_a
新フィールドには違いないから、
なにか他のクエストも
隠されてないかなって思って
アスナ
640041_7_a
うん、あそこって
あれ以来行けてないでしょ?
アスナ
640041_6_a
……あの昔の日本っぽいところか?
浦島太郎伝説ネタの
クエストがあった場所だよな
キリト
640041_5_a
前に行った南方の島を
もう一度探索してみるってどうかな?
アスナ
640041_4_a
アスナ、どうかしたのか?
キリト
640041_3_a
キリト
640041_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
ねえ、キリトくん
今日って時間ある?
アスナ
640041_1_a
ふふっ、うん
もちろんそうだよ
アスナ
640038_27_a
わたしはパパとママの娘ですよ!
640038_26_a
ああっ、そうだった
最近ずっと一緒にいたから
忘れちゃってた
アスナ
640038_25_a
あはは、そもそもユイちゃんって
アスナのピクシーじゃないしね
ユウキ
640038_24_a
NPCの子供を連れていくなんて、
プライベート・ピクシーを持ってる
プレイヤーくらいしかできないから……
アスナ
640038_23_a
ううん、どういたしまして
はあ、でもそんなフラグも
あるんだね……
アスナ
640038_22_a
でも、そっか、ありがとう
アスナにユイちゃん
ユウキ
640038_21_a
あはは、
別にそこまで気負ってた訳じゃないよ
ユウキ
640038_20_a
それにユウキが勇気を出して
訊きに行かないと、どちらにしろ
手に入らなかったものだしね
アスナ
640038_19_a
あっ、うん
わたしは別でハロウィン装備作ったし、
大丈夫だよ
アスナ
640038_18_a
でも……ユイちゃんはアスナの娘なのに
装備はボクがもらっちゃって
良かったかな?
ユウキ
640038_17_a
ううん、そういう意味じゃないよ
ユウキ
640038_16_a
そうだったんですね……すみません
わたし誰でも手に入るものだと、
思ってました……
640038_15_a
そ、そうだったんだ……
ユイちゃんが鍵だったんだね
アスナ
640038_14_a
うん、そう!
ユウキ
640038_13_a
ハロウィンの合言葉を言わないと、
あのイベントも発生しないってこと?
アスナ
640038_12_a
ええと……
じゃあ子供のNPCを連れていって、
アスナ
640038_11_a
あの人と話してお菓子をもらうことが、
最初のフラグだったらしいんだよ
ユウキ
640038_10_a
アスナ
640038_9_a
それがね……最初ユイちゃんが
お菓子をもらったNPCのおじさんが
いたでしょ?
ユウキ
640038_8_a
でも特にバトルもなかったし、
誰でも同じ手順踏めば
もらえるんじゃなかったの?
アスナ
640038_7_a
えっ?
アスナ
640038_6_a
あれって実は……
相当なレア装備だったみたい
ユウキ
640038_5_a
アスナ
640038_4_a
この前インプのおじいさんから
ハロウィン衣装もらったでしょ
ユウキ
640038_3_a
ユウキ、どうしたの?
アスナ
640038_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
アスナ、アスナ!
ユウキ
640038_1_a
うん、ボクもシウネー達に
教えてあげることにするよ
ユウキ
640037_31_a
そうだね
じゃあキリトくん達にも教えて
あげよっか
アスナ
640037_30_a
ここは一時的マップなので、
同じルートを辿れば、
誰でも手に入れられると思いますよ
640037_29_a
でもユウキがゲットできたことで
話題になって、これからは
ここに来る人増えそうだね
アスナ
640037_28_a
Hehe, you're absolutely right.
Asuna
640037_27_a
Mommy, I'm your daughter just as
much as I am Daddy's!
Yui
640037_26_a
Oh, that's true...
We've just been spending so much
time together lately, I forgot!
Asuna
640037_25_a
Hahaha, but Yui's not your pixie,
is she?
Yuuki
640037_24_a
If you need an NPC child with you,
that means only players with
private pixies can do it...
Asuna
640037_23_a
No thanks needed. But they really
do think of all sorts of event
triggers, don't they?
Asuna
640037_22_a
But thanks, you two.
Yuuki
640037_21_a
Hahaha, you say that like it was
the hardest thing I've ever
had to do...
Yuuki
640037_20_a
Besides, if you hadn't had the
guts to talk to that NPC, we never
would've known about it anyway.
Asuna
640037_19_a
Don't worry about it. I already
made my Halloween costume, so
it's fine.
Asuna
640037_18_a
But... Yui's your daughter, Asuna,
so I feel like you should've been
the one to get that item, not me.
Yuuki
640037_17_a
You don't have to apologize!
Yuuki
640037_16_a
It seems I was... I'm sorry.
I thought that was an item
anyone could get...
Yui
640037_15_a
I see... So Yui was the key to
the whole thing.
Asuna
640037_14_a
You got it!
Yuuki
640037_13_a
and they have to trick or treat
to trigger the event?
Asuna
640037_12_a
Let me get this straight... You
have to take a young NPC with
you...
Asuna
640037_11_a
It turns out that getting candy
from that NPC is what starts the
whole thing!
Yuuki
640037_10_a
I do.
Asuna
640037_9_a
Well... Okay, so remember that
old NPC that Yui got candy from
first?
Yuuki
640037_8_a
But you didn't even have to fight,
and anyone can get it if they do
the same as you, right?
Asuna
640037_7_a
What?
Asuna
640037_6_a
It turns out that it was super
rare!
Yuuki
640037_5_a
Yes?
Asuna
640037_4_a
You know how I got that Halloween
outfit from that old Imp earlier?
Yuuki
640037_3_a
Asuna
640037_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Asuna! Asunaaa!
Yuuki
640037_1_a
You must be either very foolish
or very brave to come speak
with me like this.
Yuuki
640035_21_a
Yeah, but actually, it's okay.
He was mad at first, but then
he was all,
Yuuki
640035_20_a
Haha, gotcha... Well, I'm sorry,
Yuuki. I know it's not fun to
have someone get mad at you.
Asuna
640035_19_a
Uh... I guess in the sense that
both traditions have been kind of
jumbled up over the years...
Yuuki
640035_18_a
That's not like Norse mythology,
is it?
Asuna
640035_17_a
Sure, a few do, but its origins
are actually in Celtic traditions.
Yui
640035_16_a
Hmm... Christians?
Asuna
640035_15_a
How many people do you think
know where Halloween actually
comes from?
Yuuki
640035_14_a
Yeah.
Yuuki
640035_13_a
Hahaha! Interesting...
That's definitely what happened
in the real world too.
Asuna
640035_12_a
only to be replaced by "brats
dressing up in costumes just
for the fun of it."
Yuuki
640035_11_a
He said he loathes how that
tradition has gotten lost
nowadays,
Yuuki
640035_10_a
Well, Halloween was originally a
harvest festival with rituals
to drive demons away.
Yuuki
640035_9_a
Why?
Asuna
640035_8_a
Apparently that old Imp hates
Halloween.
Yuuki
640035_7_a
Huh?!
What happened?
Asuna
640035_6_a
Ehehe.
He got really mad.
Yuuki
640035_5_a
H-How'd it go, Yuuki?
Asuna
640035_4_a
Yuuki
640035_3_a
Asuna
640035_2_a
bg_event_halloween_street
Oh, Yuuki's back!
Yui
640035_1_a
Mommy, Yuuki, I hope you'll teach
me!
Yui
640033_29_a
I suppose I have a lot left to
learn.
Yui
640033_28_a
I see... The emotions of people
from the real world are
certainly complicated...
Yui
640033_27_a
We can spend a lot of time
studying together.
Asuna
640033_26_a
I'll teach you as we go.
I'm sure Kirito would be
happy to teach you too.
Asuna
640033_25_a
Ehehe...
Maybe it's too complicated
for you to understand, Yui...
Asuna
640033_24_a
...?
Yui
640033_23_a
Call it a subtlety of emotion,
a slight nuance,
a...happy embarrassment...
Yuuki
640033_22_a
Hmmm, that is a tough question.
Yuuki
640033_21_a
Yeah.
Yui
640033_20_a
She did mention how embarrassed
she gets when other players are
watching her, huh?
Yuuki
640033_19_a
Wha-!
W-Well, I...
Asuna
640033_18_a
So why doesn't she want other
players to see her?
Yui
640033_17_a
That's why I don't understand.
Normal Mommy is so wonderful...
Yui
640033_16_a
Hehe, you can say that again!
Yuuki
640033_15_a
Hehehe, you're so pretty when
you're flustered, Mommy!
Yui
640033_14_a
Now I really don't know what to do!
Asuna
640033_13_a
Y-Yui, you too?! Even you're
talking like that...
Asuna
640033_12_a
the normal you is probably a real
change from that dignified
image they had of you.
Yui
640033_11_a
For the people used to seeing you
fighting on the front lines,
Yui
640033_10_a
As the vice commander of the
Knights of the Blood Oath, you led
a lot of players in SAO, Mommy.
Yui
640033_9_a
Hahaha, come on! "Mommy Asuna"
is just so different from "Normal
Asuna." I can't help it!
Yuuki
640033_8_a
Quit bringing that up, Yuuki!
Asuna
640033_7_a
Hehehe, I can't believe how much
things change when Yui's the one
leading you around, Asuna!
Yuuki
640033_6_a
No problem! Navigation's what
I'm here for, after all.
Yui
640033_5_a
Thanks for leading the way, Yui.
Asuna
640033_4_a
Yuuki
640033_3_a
Asuna
640033_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
It's this way.
We'll be there soon!
Yui
640033_1_a
Of course!
Asuna
640031_31_a
I want to trick or treat there
too!
Yui
640031_30_a
Oh...
Okay, why not?
Asuna
640031_29_a
It's not part of any major quest or
anything right now, but why don't
we go walk around there anyway?
Yuuki
640031_28_a
That's right. There is an area
like that near here.
Yuuki
640031_27_a
I might still get a little
embarrassed, though...
Asuna
640031_26_a
Well...
Maybe not as much.
Asuna
640031_25_a
Then you won't get embarrassed,
right?
Yui
640031_24_a
Well, why don't we go to a street
in that temporary area where
there are only NPCs?
Yui
640031_23_a
Umm... Well...a little...
Asuna
640031_22_a
Is it embarrassing when other
players look at you, Mommy?
Yui
640031_21_a
Wh-What?
C-Cut it out!
My face is already bright red!
Asuna
640031_20_a
You know, there were a lot of
other players besides me watching
you guys...
Yuuki
640031_19_a
I-I was...?
Now I feel embarrassed...
Asuna
640031_18_a
You were grinning from ear to ear
the whole time! Such a proud
mommy, hehe.
Yuuki
640031_17_a
What?! What do you mean?
Did I do something weird?
Asuna
640031_16_a
You were just so funny, watching
over Yui as she went around...
Ahaha...
Yuuki
640031_15_a
Huh? What are you laughing for?
Asuna
640031_14_a
You're very welcome.
But anyway... Hehe...
Yuuki
640031_13_a
Thank you very much, Yuuki!
Yui
640031_12_a
What do we say, Yui?
Asuna
640031_11_a
Yaaay, candy!
Yui
640031_10_a
Hehe, here you go.
Yuuki
640031_9_a
Yuuki, trick or treat!
Yui
640031_8_a
Good to see you, Yuuki!
Asuna
640031_7_a
Hi, Yuuki!
Yui
640031_6_a
Hey, Asuna. Hey, Yui.
Yuuki
640031_5_a
Hahaha!
Asuna
640031_4_a
Give me something good to eat!
If you don't, I'll...
do something naughty!
Yui
640031_3_a
Asuna
640031_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Trick or treaaaaat!
Yui
640031_1_a
Hahaha!
Asuna
640028_29_a
As if!
You totally just made that up!
Liz
640028_28_a
That privilege is reserved for
those who actually witnessed
the duel. Those are the rules!
Asuna
640028_27_a
My lips are sealed!
Yuuki
640028_26_a
Wh-What the hell?! Why?!
Come on, I HAVE to know!
Liz
640028_25_a
Yep! Our little secret.
Asuna
640028_24_a
Hahaha, it's a secret!
Yuuki
640028_23_a
Huh? What's with the giggle fit?!
Just tell me!
Liz
640028_22_a
Hehehe...
Yuuki
640028_21_a
Haha...
Asuna
640028_20_a
I-I guess...
So, who won?
Liz
640028_19_a
There's always next time, Liz.
Asuna
640028_18_a
I-It is?
Well, I guess I have no one to
blame but myself for being late...
Liz
640028_17_a
so I really wanted you
to be able to see us duel...
But it's already over.
Yuuki
640028_16_a
Sorry, Liz. You were such a huge
help on that quest to get
Asuna's new equipment,
Yuuki
640028_15_a
Liz!
Asuna
640028_14_a
Sorry I'm late, guys!!
Liz
640028_13_a
That sounds wonderful, Yuuki.
Asuna
640028_12_a
We should do this again, Asuna!
I don't think I'll ever get bored
with you as my opponent!
Yuuki
640028_11_a
You mean runner's high, right?
Hehe, I think we're definitely
somewhere in that neighborhood.
Asuna
640028_10_a
If you can push through the pain,
you reach this euphoric state...
Yuuki
640028_9_a
It's like what happens with
athletes, right?
Yuuki
640028_8_a
Yeah... I wanted that fight to
last forever!
Asuna
640028_7_a
Dueling you again felt like
something out of a dream...
Yuuki
640028_6_a
Hehehe!
Asuna
640028_5_a
Hahaha!
Yuuki
640028_4_a
sigh
...
Asuna
640028_3_a
Asuna
640028_2_a
bg_23_alne_terrace
sigh
...
Yuuki
640028_1_a
Same here!
Yuuki
640027_35_a
Me neither. I'm not going to go
easy on you, Yuuki!
Asuna
640027_34_a
I'm glad you're up for a rematch.
Hehe, I can't wait!
Yuuki
640027_33_a
Wouldn't miss it for the world!
Liz
640027_32_a
Yeah. I'll set up the date and
time. Liz, you want to come watch?
Asuna
640027_31_a
Great! I'm good to go now, but
I think you should probably get
used to your new equipment first.
Yuuki
640027_30_a
I am. I couldn't be more ready
to duel you again.
Asuna
640027_29_a
Yuuki... I...
Asuna
640027_28_a
You up for our rematch?
Yuuki
640027_27_a
Hehe, why thank you...
So, Asuna...
Yuuki
640027_26_a
It's not hard, not when you're
the embodiment of every shonen
manga hero that ever existed.
Liz
640027_25_a
Hehe, you read me like a book.
Yuuki
640027_24_a
You wanted her to equip it so
she'd be stronger and more of
a match for you.
Liz
640027_23_a
Clever, very clever...
Liz
640027_22_a
You what?!
Asuna
640027_21_a
I had a feeling you might be up
for a rematch once you got this.
Yuuki
640027_20_a
I didn't read your mind... Truth
be told, that's what I've been
hoping for since the beginning.
Yuuki
640027_19_a
Why are you apologizing?
Asuna
640027_18_a
Hehe, my bad.
Yuuki
640027_17_a
Th-That's the one...
You read my mind, Yuuki.
Asuna
640027_16_a
The one where Asuna lost, and then
you and the Sleeping Knights asked
her to help defeat the floor boss?
Liz
640027_15_a
Rematch...? You mean from when
you dueled before?
Liz
640027_14_a
Wh-What?!
Asuna
640027_13_a
Are you...thinking about our
rematch?
Yuuki
640027_12_a
...
Yuuki
640027_11_a
Oh, sorry, I'm just...thinking...
Asuna
640027_10_a
You and Yuuki both. What's going
on? This is the part where we get
super happy and celebrate, right?
Liz
640027_9_a
What do you mean?
Asuna
640027_8_a
Something wrong, Asuna?
Liz
640027_7_a
Hm?
Yuuki
640027_6_a
Th-Thanks...
Asuna
640027_5_a
Hehe, congrats, Asuna!
Liz
640027_4_a
Asuna
640027_3_a
Liz
640027_2_a
item_event_64002_coat
bg_18_tower_road
Yay! You finally got the Gale
Dancer, Asuna!
Yuuki
640027_1_a
Yeah!
Asuna
640025_27_a
Right then!
To Yggdrasil City we go!
Yuuki
640025_26_a
Hehe, it is.
Asuna
640025_25_a
And it even earned us a compliment
from the great Zekken herself!
That's pretty sweet!
Liz
640025_24_a
But still, it's nice that those
skills are coming in handy now...
I suppose.
Asuna
640025_23_a
Th-That's true...
Asuna
640025_22_a
Hehehe...
Liz
640025_21_a
So it really feels like an unfair
comparison.
Liz
640025_20_a
We had no choice but to learn
in the last game. We'd never
have survived otherwise.
Liz
640025_19_a
But the reason we know this game
so well is simply because...
Liz
640025_18_a
Huh... Well, I guess I can see
where you're coming from.
Liz
640025_17_a
You two play like total pros.
Compared to that, I feel like a
little kid playing dress-up.
Yuuki
640025_16_a
but all I've ever wanted is just
to have some fun.
Yuuki
640025_15_a
I've played plenty of VRMMOs,
Yuuki
640025_14_a
But when it comes to knowing this
game inside and out, I've got
nothing on you two.
Yuuki
640025_13_a
Hahaha, well, I guess if we're only
talking in terms of strength,
I'm not too shabby myself.
Yuuki
640025_12_a
WE'RE amazing? Hard to believe
we're anything compared to Zekken,
even if she's the one saying it.
Liz
640025_11_a
What?
Asuna
640025_10_a
I'm fine, really... Just watching
you two kinda left me in awe, you
know? You're both amazing...
Yuuki
640025_9_a
We've totally earned it,
don't you think?
Liz
640025_8_a
Yeah, we should take a break!
Liz
640025_7_a
Yuuki, are you okay?!
Do you need to catch your breath?
Asuna
640025_6_a
Phew...
Yuuki
640025_5_a
I got what I came for too!
Liz
640025_4_a
Yuuki
640025_3_a
Liz
640025_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Great!
This is the material I needed!
Asuna
640025_1_a
If this Ashley's your pick, she
must be the best tailor around!
Let's get this show on the road!
Yuuki
640023_18_a
Yep!
Asuna
640023_17_a
You're talking about Ashley,
right?
Liz
640023_16_a
Actually, Yuuki, I've already got
someone in mind.
Asuna
640023_15_a
It wouldn't hurt to start thinking
about where we might find a
player skilled at sewing, too.
Yuuki
640023_14_a
Yuppers!
Liz
640023_13_a
The place where we have to get
that crystal is the same place
where your ore is, right, Liz?
Asuna
640023_12_a
Sounds easy enough.
Asuna
640023_11_a
Then we find a player whose sewing
skill's nice and high and ask
them to use that cloth to make it.
Yuuki
640023_10_a
Once we do, the NPC will give us
some special cloth.
Yuuki
640023_9_a
First we have to accept a quest
from an NPC in Yggdrasil City to
bring back a rare crystal.
Yuuki
640023_8_a
Okay, so how do we get that
equipment?
Asuna
640023_7_a
so I was going to go anyway.
Liz
640023_6_a
No prob! The dungeon we're headed
to is apparently chock-full of
ores that I want,
Liz
640023_5_a
You did?
Thank you, Liz!
Asuna
640023_4_a
I thought she might want to help
you get your new equipment,
so I invited her along!
Yuuki
640023_3_a
Liz! What are you doing here?
Asuna
640023_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hey, Asuna! Hey, Yuuki!
Liz
640023_1_a
Totally! I mean, I know exactly
what you need to do to get it.
Come on, let's go!
Yuuki
640021_21_a
Really? Are you sure you want to
come with me?
Asuna
640021_20_a
Well, I thought we could go get it
right now! Together!
Yuuki
640021_19_a
So, how do I get my hands on it?
Asuna
640021_18_a
Yeah. Siune's specializes more
in support.
Yuuki
640021_17_a
It definitely sounds like it...
But maybe not for Siune.
Asuna
640021_16_a
That's why I figured it'd be
a perfect fit for you.
Yuuki
640021_15_a
Apparently it was tailor-made for
close combat, and it gives your
speed on land a nice buff.
Yuuki
640021_14_a
Well, only female Undine avatars
can equip it.
Yuuki
640021_13_a
Hmmm...
What kind of outfit is it?
Asuna
640021_12_a
It totally sounded like something
that'd catch your interest.
Yuuki
640021_11_a
and she mentioned there was this
new outfit called the Gale Dancer.
Yuuki
640021_10_a
Siune and I were talking about
the new equipment that was
just released,
Yuuki
640021_9_a
That's good...
Um, so what did you need?
Asuna
640021_8_a
Hahaha, I've been feeling better
than great lately! So, no need
to worry about me!
Yuuki
640021_7_a
W-Well, um...
Asuna
640021_6_a
Oh... Did you think my health had
taken a nose dive or something?
Yuuki
640021_5_a
No, it's not that... I just...
Asuna
640021_4_a
Sorry, is this a bad time?
Yuuki
640021_3_a
What's going on, Yuuki?
I didn't expect a PM from you...
Asuna
640021_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Asuna!
Yuuki
640021_1_a
They can run all they like, but
they can never break free from
this world... from this game...
Heathcliff
640018_17_a
So, people are running off
to hide in their dreams...
Heathcliff
640018_16_a
...
Heathcliff
640018_15_a
Yes, sir.
Asuna
640018_14_a
Dismissed.
Heathcliff
640018_13_a
Thank you.
Asuna
640018_12_a
Good work.
You've helped me immensely.
Heathcliff
640018_11_a
Y-Yes, Commander.
Asuna
640018_10_a
we mustn't let people become
addicts. Monitor the situation
and report back periodically.
Heathcliff
640018_9_a
While this is not of concern
to us at present,
Heathcliff
640018_8_a
Of course, Commander...
Asuna
640018_7_a
And people need time to
dream, certainly. But this can
only hinder our progress.
Heathcliff
640018_6_a
It seems people who are
desperate to return, even if only
in dreams, are buying the potion.
Asuna
640018_5_a
Indeed.
Seems it was a false alarm.
Heathcliff
640018_4_a
Yes. I see no cause for
concern at the moment.
Asuna
640018_3_a
Asuna
640018_2_a
bg_09_kob_office
I see. So that's the situation.
Heathcliff
640018_1_a
There's no way I could tell him
that I dreamt of us meeting in
the real world.
Asuna
640017_32_a
...
Asuna
640017_31_a
Kirito
640017_30_a
I'm going home!
Asuna
640017_29_a
What the heck?!
What are you so upset about?
Kirito
640017_28_a
Ugh, I don't even know
what to do with you anymore!
Asuna
640017_27_a
It was only a dream, but
it sure put a smile on my face!
Kirito
640017_26_a
Me? I had a dream about
getting a rare piece of
equipment I missed on Floor 43!
Kirito
640017_25_a
So what kind of dream did YOU
have, if you're so curious!
Asuna
640017_24_a
Oh yeah, I forgot.
Kirito
640017_23_a
Y-You know I can't tell you!
We're not allowed to talk about
the real world in here!
Asuna
640017_22_a
I knew it!
So, what did you see?
Kirito
640017_21_a
Hm?
W-Well, I mean... Yeah.
Asuna
640017_20_a
You dreamt of the real world,
didn't you?
Kirito
640017_19_a
I guess you're right.
Asuna
640017_18_a
Everyone wants to go back
to the real world, even if
it's only in their dreams.
Kirito
640017_17_a
C'mon, don't say that.
Kirito
640017_16_a
Phew...
I guess this was all some sort
of hoax then.
Asuna
640017_15_a
Just like a young kid might have
nightmares after watching a scary
movie before bed.
Kirito
640017_14_a
Dreams can be directly linked to
strong emotions like resentment
or sadness, right?
Kirito
640017_13_a
Because they all want to go home.
Kirito
640017_12_a
Then why are people dreaming
about the real world?
Asuna
640017_11_a
Probably because everyone has
dreams about the real world.
Kirito
640017_10_a
But how did a potion that makes
you dream become rumored to let
you log out safely?
Asuna
640017_9_a
Exactly.
Kirito
640017_8_a
Makes sense. Your brain is most
active during REM sleep, which
means you'd dream more.
Asuna
640017_7_a
and stimulates your brain
while you're sleeping.
Kirito
640017_6_a
Rather than "making you dream,"
it probably just makes it easier
to achieve REM sleep
Kirito
640017_5_a
I did. After checking things
out yesterday, I knew there was no
way to log out, so I tried it.
Asuna
640017_4_a
So, did you drink it?
Kirito
640017_3_a
Oh, uh, morning...
Asuna
640017_2_a
bg_02_fountain
Morning, Asuna!
Kirito
640017_1_a
Y-Yeah, you're right.
Asuna
640015_31_a
We know the rumor that
brought everyone here, right?
Kirito
640015_30_a
Let's at least get in line and
see what people are saying.
Kirito
640015_29_a
I guess not...
Kirito
640015_28_a
Shop clerk AI can't be that
complex, though. Right?
Asuna
640015_27_a
and asking them point blank if
drinking that potion lets you
log out...
Kirito
640015_26_a
Please tell me you have a plan
that doesn't involve walking up
Kirito
640015_25_a
Ah!
Asuna
640015_24_a
That clerk is the NPC, right?
Kirito
640015_23_a
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm going to ask about whatever
it is they're selling!
Asuna
640015_22_a
Get in-wait, you're gonna buy it?!
Kirito
640015_21_a
Come on, let's get in line!
Asuna
640015_20_a
Or they heard the rumors too,
and now they've come to
buy that potion!
Asuna
640015_19_a
Whoa, that's a huge line!
They must be having some
kind of sale.
Kirito
640015_18_a
Shush, Kirito!
Look at that shop over there!
Asuna
640015_17_a
Even if there is a way to
log out safely, it wouldn't be
so easy to pull off.
Kirito
640015_16_a
to cheat the system and let
you log out safely?
Kirito
640015_15_a
Isn't this just another false
rumor promising the ability
Kirito
640015_14_a
I said the same thing, at first.
Then I found out that's how
this rumor got started.
Asuna
640015_13_a
What? That's nonsense.
Kirito
640015_12_a
They say you can log out
if you drink this potion.
Asuna
640015_11_a
But it's-! Keep this between us,
but there's a really crazy
rumor floating around.
Asuna
640015_10_a
Yeah, it makes you have
dreams and stuff.
Kirito
640015_9_a
The NPC selling some strange
potion, right?
Asuna
640015_8_a
Huh? Why not?
Wait, you heard about this too?
Kirito
640015_7_a
Don't use it! You can't!
Asuna
640015_6_a
I heard there's an NPC around
here that sells some pretty cool
stuff.
Kirito
640015_5_a
Kirito!
Wh-What are you doing here?!
Asuna
640015_4_a
Oh, hey, Asuna!
Kirito
640015_3_a
I can't believe they're selling
weird potions here. But I
guess that makes this the perfect spot.
Asuna
640015_2_a
bg_02_fountain
This is the street.
Asuna
640015_1_a
You got it.
Agil
640013_23_a
I would appreciate that.
I want to get to the bottom of
this, for my own peace of mind.
Asuna
640013_22_a
I mean, there's no way you could
turn that into a way to log out,
but I could ask more about it.
Agil
640013_21_a
The real world...
Asuna
640013_20_a
I heard you dream about the
real world if you drink it
before bed or something.
Agil
640013_19_a
Yeah, you know.
Some sort of potion.
Agil
640013_18_a
C-Crazy meds?!
Asuna
640013_17_a
I've heard that NPC sells some
sort of crazy meds.
Agil
640013_16_a
There's an NPC working in a
shop on one of the lower floors.
Agil
640013_15_a
It's not directly related to what
we just talked about, but...
Agil
640013_14_a
Hm?
Asuna
640013_13_a
Yeah, you got it.
Actually... Wait up.
Agil
640013_12_a
Yes, I understand.
Well, message me if you hear
anything interesting.
Asuna
640013_11_a
So, out of all those, I can't
really point to one and say that
it's recent, know what I mean?
Agil
640013_10_a
My guild's leader said the same.
Asuna
640013_9_a
and then you've got the
people who are grasping at
straws, desperate to believe it.
Agil
640013_8_a
You've got the people
who joke about it,
Agil
640013_7_a
I mean, people are always
talking about stuff like that.
It's really nothing new.
Agil
640013_6_a
or if any of your customers
mentioned any of these rumors.
Asuna
640013_5_a
I was wondering if you'd
overheard anything,
Asuna
640013_4_a
Gotcha.
Agil
640013_3_a
Agil
640013_2_a
bg_05_agil_shop
That's the story so far.
Asuna
640013_1_a
Thank you.
Asuna
640011_27_a
Yes, I suppose you're right.
I'll leave you to it, then.
Heathcliff
640011_26_a
We have a tough boss fight
in a few days, and this isn't
a scouting mission.
Asuna
640011_25_a
That won't be necessary.
Asuna
640011_24_a
Take anyone you think might
be of assistance to you.
Heathcliff
640011_23_a
Understood.
Asuna
640011_22_a
Use your powers of persuasion
on anyone spreading rumors,
or looking especially desperate.
Heathcliff
640011_21_a
Now, would you kindly
investigate this turn of events?
Heathcliff
640011_20_a
No, we can't.
Asuna
640011_19_a
to keep losing such valuable
players now, can we?
Heathcliff
640011_18_a
Even so, if we are to finish
this game, we cannot afford
Heathcliff
640011_17_a
On some level I understand.
We've been trapped for a year.
People are at their wits' end.
Asuna
640011_16_a
People will believe anything
when they're desperate.
Even lies can be comforting.
Asuna
640011_15_a
allows you to log out.
To think people actually believe
these crazy lies...
Heathcliff
640011_14_a
Indeed it does.
Just like the rumor that jumping
from the outer ring of Aincrad
Heathcliff
640011_13_a
That rumor gets circulated every
now and again, like clockwork.
Asuna
640011_12_a
I, of course, have no
way of verifying this.
Heathcliff
640011_11_a
That some sort of way to
circumvent the system exists.
Heathcliff
640011_10_a
Essentially, it's a baseless
rumor that players can log out
through some special means.
Heathcliff
640011_9_a
The logout system...?
Asuna
640011_8_a
It seems there's been an increase
in the frequency of claims about
a loophole in the logout system.
Heathcliff
640011_7_a
Indeed.
I hired an info broker to
look into it.
Heathcliff
640011_6_a
What's all of this?
Some sort of data file?
Asuna
640011_5_a
Have a look at this.
Heathcliff
640011_4_a
Go ahead.
Asuna
640011_3_a
Ah, yes, Asuna.
I have something to ask of you.
Heathcliff
640011_2_a
bg_09_kob_office
You wanted to see me, Commander?
Asuna
640011_1_a
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Thanks for the talk, Kirito!
Seven
440048_27_a
But I figured it might be nice for
you two to straighten out your
relationship as sisters.
Kirito
440048_26_a
It's just something to think
about!
Kirito
440048_25_a
Hehe, Kirito's silver tongue
strikes again.
Asuna
440048_24_a
Well, it sounds great when you put
it like that!
Seven
440048_23_a
And that frees you up to just be
her big sister.
Kirito
440048_22_a
While, on the other hand, Rain has
just begun pursuing her dream.
Kirito
440048_21_a
But now you've retired from
singing and are focused on your
research.
Kirito
440048_20_a
Up until now, you were everything
Rain wanted to be, and also her
main rival.
Kirito
440048_19_a
What do you mean?
Seven
440048_18_a
No, the exact opposite.
Kirito
440048_17_a
Does that mean I can't be
close to her anymore?
Seven
440048_16_a
I-I know that!
But...
Seven
440048_15_a
but now that she's taken her first
step on this path, you might have
to let her go her own way.
Kirito
440048_14_a
I mean, you can pretty easily give
her advice since your career is
what she's after,
Kirito
440048_13_a
Gah!!
Seven
440048_12_a
You might even have to step aside
as her mentor, too.
Kirito
440048_11_a
I will not!
Seven
440048_10_a
And by the end of her show, you'll
be a teary-eyed mess. I'm calling
it now!
Asuna
440048_9_a
Ha ha, there you go again!
Asuna
440048_8_a
You've got that right. Now all
she needs is a little more
confidence!
Seven
440048_7_a
Some hobbies can push you to new
heights in real life too.
Kirito
440048_6_a
Yeah, Rain's the real deal.
As if being a top-tier player
wasn't enough...
Kirito
440048_5_a
Seven
440048_4_a
Kirito
440048_3_a
Wow, they're really into it!
Asuna
440048_2_a
bg_event_idol_stage
WOOOOOO! Alright!!
Audience
440048_1_a
Good luck, sis! Shake off
those second-show jitters!
Seven
440047_26_a
Seven
440047_25_a
Got it!
Okay, here I go!
Rain
440047_24_a
I'll cue up the opening number!
Silica
440047_23_a
Hey Rain! The stage is all set!
Liz
440047_22_a
Rain
440047_21_a
Okay, fine. Go ahead and delay
the inevitable.
Seven
440047_20_a
You're making the right call.
Kirito
440047_19_a
Asuna
440047_18_a
Ha ha, I knew you'd say that.
Revealing your identity online
is pretty risky.
Kirito
440047_17_a
Are you insane?!
No, I'm still changing!
Rain
440047_16_a
Hehe... So are you gonna go out
there in your real avatar after
all?
Seven
440047_15_a
I'm just so grateful!
Rain
440047_14_a
But here I am, with another huge
opportunity to sing for a crowd...
Rain
440047_13_a
Seven
440047_12_a
You're right. I thought that
Christmas show would be
a one-time thing...
Rain
440047_11_a
Hehe, you should be thrilled!
They're all here because they
saw your video.
Asuna
440047_9_a
Kirito
440047_10_a
Keep it together! You've been
cool as a cucumber so far!
Seven
440047_8_a
Seven
440047_7_a
Oh my gosh! Don't make me
freak out now!
Rain
440047_6_a
All of these people are here to
see you.
Kirito
440047_5_a
Asuna
440047_4_a
Take a peek from the side of the
stage, Rain.
Kirito
440047_3_a
Seven
440047_2_a
bg_event_idol_stage
...
Rain
440047_1_a
We'll think of something!
You've come too far not to
take this next step!
Nanairo
440045_33_a
Nanairo
440045_32_a
Rika
440045_31_a
Th-That's a good point...
Nijika
440045_30_a
They're right. We can even use
transformation magic if you
want.
Asuna
440045_29_a
Asuna
440045_28_a
Keiko
440045_27_a
You could change up your look
even more in ALO.
Kazuto
440045_26_a
You'd rather stick to real-world
stages, huh? Why don't you wear
a mask, then?
Nanairo
440045_25_a
And Rain is finally getting some
name recognition in ALO. It'll
look like self-promotion.
Nijika
440045_24_a
Still, I don't know that I want
people associating Rain with
an amateur singer...
Nijika
440045_23_a
Well, it's a little late now.
You just appeared on a live
stream with me.
Nanairo
440045_22_a
B-But people in VR don't know my
true identity like they know
Nana's! I don't know about this...
Nijika
440045_21_a
Rika
440045_20_a
Nijika
440045_19_a
Ha ha, oops! Sorry...
Nanairo
440045_18_a
I'll pretend I didn't hear that...
Agil
440045_17_a
Rika
440045_16_a
Nijika
440045_15_a
You'll have enough seats for
everyone, and the audio equipment
will be way better.
Nanairo
440045_14_a
Ah, c'mon! I've got a stage kit
you can use. It'll be a cinch!
Nanairo
440045_13_a
No way?!
Nijika
440045_12_a
We can do that easily!
Just do a show with the
same setlist in VR!
Nanairo
440045_9_a
Rika
440045_11_a
Nijika
440045_10_a
Asuna
440045_8_a
Keiko
440045_7_a
That makes sense.
Kazuto
440045_6_a
Which is actually a good sign,
if you think about it! They want
you to play bigger places!
Rika
440045_5_a
People thought the venue was a
bit small and filled with all your
friends.
Rika
440045_4_a
Nanairo
440045_3_a
Nijika
440045_2_a
bg_16_pub
I mean, they're not personal
attacks or anything.
Rika
440045_1_a
Really?
Nijika
440043_36_a
Hmm, not all the comments are
positive, though.
Rika
440043_35_a
Heh, thanks for saying so.
Nijika
440043_34_a
No way! They were obviously all
excited to see you!
Nanairo
440043_33_a
Rika
440043_32_a
Nanairo
440043_31_a
I get it, though. You'd be excited
too if a former pro showed up
at some no-name's show.
Nijika
440043_30_a
Asuna
440043_29_a
Keiko
440043_28_a
I thought that might be why...
Kazuto
440043_27_a
Rika
440043_26_a
Nanairo
440043_25_a
I know. Everyone got really
excited when Nana suddenly
showed up.
Nijika
440043_24_a
I hate to say this, but looking at
these comments...
Kazuto
440043_23_a
Asuna
440043_22_a
Keiko
440043_21_a
...
Kazuto
440043_20_a
That doesn't make it any less
difficult, though.
Nijika
440043_19_a
My late-blooming sister's getting
pretty savvy!
Nanairo
440043_18_a
I figured I couldn't make it big
without putting in the effort to
expand my audience.
Nijika
440043_17_a
Rika
440043_16_a
Nanairo
440043_15_a
Hm? Uh, yeah, I gave the okay.
Nijika
440043_14_a
Kazuto
440043_13_a
Keiko
440043_12_a
There was a live stream?
Is that okay with you?
Asuna
440043_11_a
Nanairo
440043_9_a
Oh wow, they really are!
Nijika
440043_8_a
Rika
440043_10_a
Asuna
440043_7_a
Kazuto
440043_6_a
Ooh, it's a live stream of your
show. And the viewer and comment
numbers are through the roof!
Keiko
440043_5_a
What's up, Rika?
Nijika
440043_4_a
Nanairo
440043_3_a
Nijika
440043_2_a
bg_16_pub
Hey, hey! Look at this!
Rika
440043_1_a
Yeah, great job out there!
Asuna
440041_24_a
Asuna
440041_23_a
Keiko
440041_22_a
Of course. You sounded great!
Kazuto
440041_21_a
Nanairo
440041_20_a
Thanks, Nana! And thanks for
cheering me on, guys.
Nijika
440041_19_a
You did such a great job, sis!
Waaaaah!
Nanairo
440041_18_a
Hehe, go easy on my little sister!
Nijika
440041_17_a
Oh, shut up!
Nanairo
440041_16_a
Nanairo
440041_15_a
I guess there are some nice side
effects to you acting grown-up
all the time.
Kazuto
440041_14_a
Asuna
440041_13_a
Hehe, you've got a soft spot for
your sister, huh, Nanairo?
Keiko
440041_12_a
Me too! But then the dam burst
and all those emotions just came
flooding out.
Rika
440041_11_a
Rika
440041_9_a
Hehe, I seem to recall a bit of
complaining at the start...
Asuna
440041_8_a
Keiko
440041_10_a
I did, but that's not the point...
Kazuto
440041_7_a
What, you didn't think my sister's
show was amazing?
Nanairo
440041_6_a
Wait, where's all this coming
from? You were super salty at
the start of the show.
Kazuto
440041_5_a
Kazuto
440041_4_a
Oh my gosh, sis...
That was... 
sniff
That was incredible!
Nanairo
440041_3_a
Wooo! We love you!
Audience
440041_2_a
bg_16_pub
Thank you so much!
Nijika
440041_1_a
Right!
Asuna, Kirito...
Thank you so much!
Rain
440038_26_a
You've got to put your
own self first, Rain.
Asuna
440038_25_a
Oh! But only when you can.
No stress, okay?
Asuna
440038_24_a
Just come hang out with
us more! That's enough.
Asuna
440038_23_a
But, still...I'm so grateful!
I don't know how I can make
this up to you!
Rain
440038_22_a
Heh! Trust me.
It's strictly business.
Kirito
440038_21_a
Kirito, please!
Don't do anything nefarious!
Asuna
440038_20_a
A substantial favor.
A couple of Augmas are
a drop in the bucket.
Kirito
440038_19_a
Heh heh...
Let's just say Kikuoka
owes me a favor.
Kirito
440038_18_a
But is it really okay to
accept this kind of special
treatment?
Rain
440038_17_a
He already knew about you and
Seven, so it was easy to
get him on board.
Kirito
440038_16_a
...! B-But!
Rain
440038_15_a
you're still an SAO
survivor. So you should be
entitled to a free Augma, too.
Kirito
440038_14_a
I got in touch with Mr.
Kikuoka. Even though you're
not enrolled at the school,
Kirito
440038_13_a
What are you talking about?
Rain
440038_12_a
Kirito?
Asuna
440038_11_a
Problem solved!
Kirito
440038_10_a
Heh heh! Suuuuure you are...
Rain
440038_9_a
I don't get much allowance,
and I can't take a part-time
job! I'm scraping by, too...
Asuna
440038_8_a
Oh, come on! I'm not
THAT out of touch...!
Asuna
440038_7_a
How nice of you to show
sympathy for us peasants...
Rain
440038_6_a
Ha ha!
Oh, Asuna...
Rain
440038_5_a
Oh, right!
I forgot about that...
They are pretty expensive.
Asuna
440038_4_a
Asuna
440038_3_a
Kirito
440038_2_a
bg_event_festival
Well, that just leaves the
problem of buying an Augma.
Rain
440038_1_a
Ha ha! I know! That's why you
really remind me of someone
else we know...
Asuna
440037_17_a
I know I can get a little
TOO competitive when
it comes to games...
Rain
440037_16_a
I get it now! Heh. I guess
that does make me feel better.
Rain
440037_15_a
Ordinal Scale seemed like
the perfect opportunity.
Asuna
440037_14_a
Ha ha ha! You got me... I
thought it'd be a good chance
for us to hang out more!
Asuna
440037_13_a
Is that the real reason
you wanted me to play it?
Rain
440037_12_a
Aw, Asuna...
Rain
440037_11_a
If you think of it that way,
does that take the pressure
off?
Asuna
440037_10_a
With Ordinal Scale, unless you
go for Top 10, you can just
hang out and have fun.
Asuna
440037_9_a
But, on the other hand, you
don't have to get obsessed.
Asuna
440037_8_a
Yeah... That's why I figured
I'd save myself the stress.
Rain
440037_7_a
It makes sense to wait until
you can invest the time and
energy into something.
Asuna
440037_6_a
Oh, uh, I guess I do.
Rain
440037_5_a
But when you get into a new
game, you really, REALLY
get into it, right?
Asuna
440037_4_a
Aw, Asuna...
Rain
440037_3_a
Rain
440037_2_a
bg_event_festival
Of course...I'd still
love to play Ordinal Scale
with you!
Asuna
440037_1_a
Asuna...
Rain
440035_18_a
It's okay to prioritize, Rain.
Plus, you've got your dream of
being a singer to work on!
Asuna
440035_17_a
If I try to cram too much
into my head,
it pushes other stuff out!
Rain
440035_16_a
Well, I can only handle
one or two games,
what with school and all.
Rain
440035_15_a
What do you mean?
Asuna
440035_14_a
Kinda... But it's more like
I can't commit to things
like you guys.
Rain
440035_13_a
But what about you, Rain?
Still not sold on
Ordinal Scale?
Asuna
440035_12_a
Man, that girl does
not know when to quit!
She sure hates to lose.
Rain
440035_11_a
Seven went off to
help out as well.
Asuna
440035_10_a
I see...
Rain
440035_9_a
They went to find Kirito.
Sounds like he needed
help with a boss.
Asuna
440035_8_a
Hmm?
Where'd the others go?
Rain
440035_7_a
Heh heh! No problem.
Asuna
440035_6_a
Wow, thanks!
Rain
440035_5_a
Yep! They're selling
it over there.
Asuna
440035_4_a
Oh, wow!
What's this?
"Tropical Punch"?
Rain
440035_3_a
Rain
440035_2_a
bg_event_festival
Hey, Rain!
Have this.
Asuna
440035_1_a
M-Me? Well, I...
Rain
440033_40_a
Grrr!
Well, how about you, Rain?!
Seven
440033_39_a
Seven
440033_38_a
Maybe Seven's not
quite ready to fight with
you guys just yet...
Rain
440033_37_a
Asuna

Sinon
440033_35_a
Ha ha! She looks young,
but Silica's a little older
than you, Seven!
Suguha
440033_34_a
That's awesome...
Seven
440033_33_a
Rain
440033_32_a
pant
Y-Yeah, but Silica
can... 
pant
...keep up
with you guys!
Seven
440033_31_a
Suguha
440033_30_a
There's not much you can
do about that, though.
Sinon
440033_29_a
Asuna
440033_28_a
Suguha
440033_27_a
Seven's barely hanging in...
Things like age and fitness
make a difference in ARMMOs.
Sinon
440033_26_a
pant, pant
Seven
440033_25_a
Seven
440033_24_a
Yeah, I'll say!
Phew!
Rain
440033_23_a
Suguha
440033_22_a
Sinon
440033_21_a
Ha ha! Just watch out you
don't run out of stamina.
Asuna
440033_20_a
Seven
440033_19_a
Heh heh!
Thanks, guys... 
pant
Rain
440033_18_a
I guess fighting in ALO helped
you build up the same skills
you need for Ordinal Scale!
Suguha
440033_17_a
Yeah!
It's really impressive!
Suguha
440033_16_a
Asuna
440033_15_a
Suguha
440033_14_a
You sure did!
It's your first day, but you
just keep getting better!
Sinon
440033_13_a
Seven
440033_12_a
Oh! 
pant
Thanks.
I'm glad...
pant
...
I could help.
Rain
440033_11_a
Suguha
440033_9_a
Nice one, Rain!
Asuna
440033_8_a
Sinon
440033_10_a
GRAAAAAWRGH...!
Monster
440033_7_a
Taaake THIS!
Rain
440033_6_a
Seven
440033_5_a
Okay!
Rain
440033_4_a
Asuna
440033_3_a
Sinon
440033_2_a
bg_event_festival
Rain!
You take that one!
Suguha
440033_1_a
Suguha
440031_43_a
Sinon
440031_42_a
Rain...
Asuna
440031_41_a
Seven
440031_40_a
Exactly... 
sigh
Rain
440031_39_a
Suguha
440031_38_a
Moving around uses up
a lot of time and energy.
Sinon
440031_37_a
Suguha
440031_36_a
Asuna
440031_35_a
I get that. Augmented reality
is pretty different from a
full dive into a VRMMO.
Sinon
440031_34_a
And, anyway, I'm really
putting my all into ALO
for now...
Rain
440031_33_a
Seven
440031_32_a
Ha ha! I don't need my
little sister spoiling me!
Rain
440031_31_a
Suguha
440031_30_a
Sinon
440031_29_a
Ha ha! Very magnanimous
of you, Professor.
Asuna
440031_28_a
Hey, Rain! I'll buy you
one, if you want!
Seven
440031_27_a
Seven
440031_26_a
That's true.
Rain
440031_25_a
And an Augma's not exactly
the kind of thing you buy
on a whim.
Suguha
440031_24_a
It's too far away for
some kids to travel.
Asuna
440031_23_a
Suguha
440031_22_a
Sinon
440031_21_a
Not all of us go
there, after all.
Asuna
440031_20_a
Seven
440031_19_a
That's right. I don't.
Rain
440031_18_a
Asuna
440031_17_a
Suguha
440031_16_a
Oh, wait! You don't go to
the SAO Survivor's School,
do you...?
Sinon
440031_15_a
Seven
440031_14_a
Yeah...
Rain
440031_13_a
Asuna
440031_12_a
Suguha
440031_11_a
Why don't you buy your own?
Then you can play whenever
you want.
Sinon
440031_10_a
Seven
440031_9_a
I know...
I wish we could keep them,
though!
Rain
440031_8_a
Suguha
440031_7_a
But be careful with those
Augma units. You've gotta give
them back, remember?
Asuna
440031_6_a
Sinon
440031_5_a
Asuna
440031_4_a
That's great!
I'm glad you like it.
Suguha
440031_3_a
Rain
440031_2_a
bg_event_festival
I wasn't sure what it'd be
like, but now that I'm used to
it, Ordinal Scale's fun!
Seven
440031_1_a
Agreed!
Yuuki
440028_16_a
Me, too.
Let's try the other quests
if we have time.
Asuna
440028_15_a
It was fun to learn about the
Chinese tale, but I wanna
check out the others, too.
Yuuki
440028_14_a
Luckily for them,
the father accepted
their love in the end.
Kirito
440028_13_a
Ha ha! That part was more
like a soap opera
than an ancient folktale.
Kirito
440028_12_a
That sure shut him up!
Yuuki
440028_11_a
And then when the angel
came in and set the emperor
straight about their love?
Yuuki
440028_10_a
Standing up to the
Jade Emperor took
a lot of courage.
Asuna
440028_9_a
but that cowherd was
one, super-cool NPC!
Yuuki
440028_8_a
You said it!
Sure, he was a pretty
crummy fighter,
Yuuki
440028_7_a
I'm just glad those two got
to live happily ever after!
Asuna
440028_6_a
Even if the cowherd boy
DID get the glory for the
battles we won...
Kirito
440028_5_a
Yeah! Everything all worked
out in the end.
Asuna
440028_4_a
Kirito
440028_3_a
Asuna
440028_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Phew! All's well
that ends well!
Yuuki
440028_1_a
This mortal and I are united
by true love. It's time you
knew the truth...
Angel
440027_48_a
...!
Daughter...
Jade Emperor
440027_47_a
Father!
That's enough.
Angel
440027_46_a
Why, you...!
You insolent, little human!
Jade Emperor
440027_45_a
If that isn't enough for you,
then what good are your rules?
Cowherd
440027_44_a
I agreed to submit to
your trials, and I made
it through each one.
Cowherd
440027_43_a
Nnngh!
Jade Emperor
440027_42_a
...was you, Emperor!
Cowherd
440027_41_a
And the one who declared that
any mortal who succeeded
would be worthy of heaven...
Cowherd
440027_40_a
The point of these trials was
to prove a mortal's worth.
Cowherd
440027_39_a
What?!
Jade Emperor
440027_38_a
Do you expect me to accept
your ridiculous objections?
Cowherd
440027_37_a
Asuna
440027_36_a
Kirito
440027_35_a
Yuuki
440027_34_a
Jade Emperor or no,
I say you're wrong!
Cowherd
440027_33_a
It's no use. He's probably
programmed to ignore player characters.
Kirito
440027_32_a
Grrr... There's gotta
be something we can do!
Yuuki
440027_31_a
SILENCE!
I have no time for
your nonsense.
Jade Emperor
440027_30_a
Yeah! Get off your
high horse, Gramps!
Yuuki
440027_29_a
You can't do this!
These two love each other from
the bottom of their hearts!
Asuna
440027_28_a
As for my grandchildren...
To recompense your efforts,
I'll take them off your hands.
Jade Emperor
440027_27_a
to be stolen from
heaven by a boorishly
persistent mortal!
Jade Emperor
440027_26_a
To you?! Impossible!
Never would I allow
my beloved daughter
Jade Emperor
440027_25_a
But I love her!
Give her back!
Cowherd
440027_24_a
I grow weary of your
mortal stench, human.
Begone!
Jade Emperor
440027_23_a
That's her dad...
the Jade Emperor!
Asuna
440027_22_a
You dare approach my heavenly
domain to besmirch my
daughter's honor?
???
440027_21_a
Asuna
440027_20_a
Yuuki
440027_19_a
What was that?
Kirito
440027_18_a
Foolish mortals...
???
440027_17_a
I-I won't! I promise!
Cowherd
440027_16_a
Don't let that Jade Emperor
push you around!
Yuuki
440027_15_a
That's right.
So don't you give up,
either, no matter what!
Yuuki
440027_14_a
No problem!
We'll do whatever it takes
to get you two together!
Asuna
440027_13_a
To think you would fight
so hard for such complete
strangers!
Cowherd
440027_12_a
Band of mystery heroes,
I can't thank you enough.
Cowherd
440027_11_a
Just a little further to go!
Kirito
440027_10_a
Asuna
440027_9_a
Kirito
440027_8_a
Alright! That's one more
trial out of the way.
Yuuki
440027_7_a
Gyaaaaagh!
Monster
440027_6_a
Taaaaake THIS!
Yuuki
440027_5_a
Asuna
440027_4_a
Kirito
440027_3_a
Yuuki
440027_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
GRAAAAAOOOOOH!
Monster
440027_1_a
Heh heh! You two sure changed
your opinion about the cowherd
in the end, didn't you.
Kirito
440025_32_a
Yeah!
Asuna
440025_31_a
Yeah! Let's make sure he
wins and gets the girl!
Yuuki
440025_30_a
The next part must be
about the cowherd's trials.
I bet that's where we come in!
Asuna
440025_29_a
Yeah! Now I'm rooting
for the cowherd!
Yuuki
440025_28_a
That's true. A couple who'd do
anything for love, huh?
Kirito
440025_27_a
That's pretty different
from the version we
grew up hearing!
Asuna
440025_26_a
And she had to go
back to heaven alone.
Yuuki
440025_25_a
Kirito
440025_24_a
Asuna
440025_23_a
So the years passed,
the angel bore children,
the Jade Emperor found out...
Yuuki
440025_22_a
But for you...I'll do it!
Cowherd
440025_21_a
It's just too risky!
Angel
440025_20_a
But I hear those
trials are far too
perilous for any mortal...
Angel
440025_19_a
If I succeed, surely
the Jade Emperor will
find me worthy!
Cowherd
440025_18_a
A mortal must pass many
trials in order to meet
with a heavenly being.
Cowherd
440025_17_a
You will return to heaven,
and I will come to see you.
Cowherd
440025_16_a
But what shall we
do after that?
Angel
440025_15_a
the Jade Emperor will
bear no anger toward you.
Cowherd
440025_14_a
It will leave you blameless.
If he thinks you're being held
here against your will,
Cowherd
440025_13_a
But why?
Angel
440025_12_a
I'll take all the blame! While
you bathe in that spring, I'll
steal away your feather robe.
Cowherd
440025_11_a
Oh, thank goodness!
These two are really
in love after all!
Asuna
440025_10_a
Wow.
I wasn't expecting that...
Yuuki
440025_9_a
...
Kirito
440025_8_a
If the Jade Emperor were
to learn of our love, how
terrifying his rage would be!
Cowherd
440025_7_a
But, alas, you are a mortal...
and I, a daughter of heaven.
What would Father say?
Angel
440025_6_a
And I, you!
Cowherd
440025_5_a
Asuna
440025_4_a
Yuuki
440025_3_a
Kirito
440025_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
I've fallen for you, my love!
Angel
440025_1_a
L-Let's just relax and see how
the story plays out, shall we?
Kirito
440023_28_a
In fact, I'm going to
put a stop to this!
Asuna
440023_27_a
I could never support
a man like that!
Asuna
440023_26_a
I--!
No, I just mean--!
Sorry...
Kirito
440023_25_a
Kirito, he's evil!
Asuna
440023_24_a
You're taking HIS side?!
Yuuki
440023_23_a
Jeez, it's just a fairy tale.
Why take it so seriously?
Kirito
440023_22_a
Yeah. And that's a BIG
problem, if you ask me!
Asuna
440023_21_a
He's basically holding
the angel prisoner, right?!
Yuuki
440023_20_a
Ugh! The guy in that
story is a total creep!
Yuuki
440023_19_a
Yeah. He steals it
while she's bathing.
Asuna
440023_18_a
...so she can't fly
back to heaven, right?
Yuuki
440023_17_a
That's the one about
the cowherd hiding the
angel's feather robe...
Yuuki
440023_16_a
The Chinese Tanabata myth
must be like the "Angel Wife"
story in Japan, then.
Kirito
440023_15_a
So she's an angel?
Yuuki
440023_14_a
Oh, you're right!
Asuna
440023_13_a
Hey, wait a second. What's the
Orihime character wearing?
Is that a feather robe?
Kirito
440023_12_a
So this is the part of
the story where they meet.
Yuuki
440023_11_a
Yeah, for now, I think that's
all we're supposed to do.
Kirito
440023_10_a
it looks like they're here
as NPCs. Are we just supposed
to watch?
Asuna
440023_9_a
In the main quest, they were
playable roles, but in this
"World Stories" side quest
Asuna
440023_8_a
Looks like it.
Yuuki
440023_7_a
So they're the Orihime and
Hikoboshi from the original
Chinese story?
Kirito
440023_6_a
Oh, darling!
Women
440023_5_a
Asuna
440023_4_a
Yuuki
440023_3_a
Kirito
440023_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
Oh, my love,
how beautiful you are!
Man
440023_1_a
Same here!
Asuna
440021_15_a
Count me in!
Kirito
440021_14_a
Wanna go right to the source
and check out the Chinese one?
Yuuki
440021_13_a
That sounds about right.
Kirito
440021_12_a
Tanabata started in China
and spread from there,
so there are a lot.
Asuna
440021_11_a
Neat!
Hmmm, which country
should we pick?
Yuuki
440021_10_a
and then get to experience
similar festivals in other
cultures.
Kirito
440021_9_a
Hey, I get it!
You do the Japanese Tanabata
in the main quest,
Kirito
440021_8_a
Japan isn't the only country
with this tale of star-crossed
lovers, after all.
Yuuki
440021_7_a
It says "Tanabata Quest:
World Stories." Cool!
Tanabata stories from abroad!
Yuuki
440021_6_a
Maybe it's a side quest?
Let's take a look.
Asuna
440021_5_a
Hey, you're right.
Didn't we already clear
the Tanabata quest?
Kirito
440021_4_a
Asuna
440021_3_a
Kirito
440021_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
What do we have here?
A new quest?
Yuuki
440021_1_a
Here I come!
Rain
440018_25_a
Water fight challenge accepted!
Bring it, Rain!
Seven
440018_24_a
Hah hah hah! They don't call
me Rain for nothing! Fear my
precipitation powers!!!
Rain
440018_23_a
Hwa-GAAH?! What a fearsome
water attack... Just what I'd
expect from the DPS master!
Sphica
440018_22_a
Which means...TAKE THIS!
SPLAAASH BOMMMBBB!!
Rain
440018_21_a
Now you listen here, missy!
...Heh heh, you're right! Smithing
class is officially on hold!
Rain
440018_20_a
You're still just a kid too,
you know!
Seven
440018_19_a
Hmph! Duh! Because you're trying
to act like a borin' old grown-up,
that's why!
Seven
440018_18_a
Gaaah?! Seven!! Why'd you have
to go and splash me?!
Rain
440018_17_a
Splash attack!
Seven
440018_16_a
I guess you're still just a
naughty little ki-?!
Rain
440018_15_a
Well, look at this. Little Miss
Genius Scientist is splashing
around in muddy puddles.
Rain
440018_14_a
I'M OUTSIDE AND IT'S RAINING
AND I'M SO EXCITED RIGHT NOW!!
Sphica
440018_13_a
Yeah, totally. But that doesn't
mean we can't play on the way!
Seven
440018_12_a
sigh
... What happened to the
floodgates, children? Aren't we
fixing them?
Rain
440018_11_a
Mmmph?!
Oh, it is ON now!
Seven
440018_10_a
You did it now! Revenge splash!
WACHAA!!
Sphica
440018_9_a
Gack! Seven!! You splashed water
all over my face!
Sphica
440018_8_a
Whoa! Giant puddle, spotted!
It's splash time!
Seven
440018_7_a
Stop fussing, we'll be fine!
This is a virtual world!
Who cares if we get a little wet?
Seven
440018_6_a
Hey, you two, stop fooling around
and put up your umbrellas!
Rain
440018_5_a
Yay! Ha ha ha!
Sphica
440018_4_a
Rain
440018_3_a
Sphica
440018_2_a
bg_event_swamp
Ahahaha!
Seven
440018_1_a
I really didn't want to go outside
today...
Rain
440017_25_a
Then what are we waiting for?!
Let's go! Go go go!
Sphica
440017_24_a
That's the deal.
Rain
440017_23_a
Sure, why not. So our
problem's solved if we
open those floodgates?
Seven
440017_22_a
This quest pops up sometimes.
You need to open a few floodgates
to wash out the sludge.
Rain
440017_21_a
Wait a sec...
Ah! I remembered something!
Rain
440017_20_a
This gross dirty stuff is totally
worthless...
Sphica
440017_19_a
Well, that's just great...
Isn't clean water crucial
for forging items?
Seven
440017_18_a
That's not good...
Maybe this downpour has
muddied all the streams?
Rain
440017_17_a
It's nine parts mud,
one part water!
Sphica
440017_16_a
Well, a little's coming out now...
AH! Ick!
Wh-What is this?!
Seven
440017_15_a
Hey, what's going on here?
The water's not coming out...
Are the pipes clogged?
Rain
440017_14_a
Ahaha... I'm pretty sure a player
can't make epic equips like-
Huh?
Rain
440017_13_a
Then I'll make a super cool
Legendary Weapon of Ultimate
Power!
Sphica
440017_12_a
Watch this! I'm gonna whip up
an Ancient Weapon-level awesome
something or other!
Seven
440017_11_a
Oh, but what sort of weapon
should I make? I can't decide!
Sphica
440017_10_a
Yay!
I'm having so much fun!
Sphica
440017_9_a
Yeah, let's make something!
Rain
440017_8_a
Now comes the main course!
It's smithing time!
Seven
440017_7_a
...Not that I've ever forged
anything in real life. Hah. Hah.
Rain
440017_6_a
Hehe! You think that's bad,
but it's nowhere near as hot
as it is in real life.
Rain
440017_5_a
Ah! It's so hot!
Sphica
440017_4_a
Rain
440017_3_a
Sphica
440017_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo_sunset
Smelting finished!
Seven
440017_1_a
Well, I suppose it's all right.
Okay, let's get started!
Rain
440015_16_a
sigh
...
If you wanna try, just say so.
Rain
440015_15_a
Y-Yeah, it is, isn't it...?
I, uh, guess I'll try it.
Just a little.
Seven
440015_14_a
Wow, this is super fun!
It's like arts and crafts class!
Sphica
440015_13_a
And among those mods, this combo
foundry/smelter/forge is AWESOME-
and only here in Leprechaun land!
Rain
440015_12_a
Wow...
Seven
440015_11_a
They cut out lots of details. But
that's boring, so there are modules
like this that add realism.
Rain
440015_10_a
Ahaha! Surprising, isn't it? Most
VRMMO crafting systems-cooking,
smithing, etc.-are super basic.
Rain
440015_9_a
H-Hold up! This isn't your average
la-dee-da game crafting system,
it's the real deal!
Seven
440015_8_a
Next is the actual smithy. Here we
use fire and water to shape metal
ingots into tools and equipment.
Rain
440015_7_a
Whoa...
This place is so big!
Sphica
440015_6_a
Then we take the iron sand over
here-this is called a smelter-and
melt it gooood.
Rain
440015_5_a
Do what now?
Seven
440015_4_a
Sphica
440015_3_a
Seven
440015_2_a
bg_event_lisbeth_smith_alo_sunset
See this? It's raw, mined ore.
Our first task is to separate the
iron sand from the regular sand.
Rain
440015_1_a
Oh ho ho, you have much to
learn, young apprentice.
Rain
440013_18_a
Is that actually fun?
Seven
440013_17_a
Creating items and armor and so on
is just levels and numbers and
percentages...
Seven
440013_16_a
But this is a game, so isn't
smithing here just putting the
right materials together?
Seven
440013_15_a
I wanna hit stuff with hammers!
Sphica
440013_14_a
You want us to try blacksmithing?
Hmm... I guess I've never tried
it before...
Seven
440013_13_a
Brainstorm! Since we're here,
why not take a hands-on tour
of a Leprechaun smithy?
Rain
440013_12_a
sigh
... Well, what do you expect
me to do about-OH!
Rain
440013_11_a
Boooooored!! Bored bored bored!
Sphica
440013_10_a
Oh, come on!
I'm BORED!
Seven
440013_9_a
Umm... I thought we were here for
a tour of Leprechaun territory,
not to play around?
Rain
440013_8_a
Yeah! And if kids don't play
outside, the grown-ups will
yell at them!
Sphica
440013_7_a
Well, if we stay in here, what
was the point of coming in the
first place?!
Seven
440013_6_a
Come on, you two, it's pouring
out there! We can't go outside
today.
Rain
440013_5_a
Yeah! We came all the way to
Leprechaun town! Let's go out
and have some fun!
Sphica
440013_4_a
Rain
440013_3_a
Sphica
440013_2_a
bg_s2_20_restaurant
Ugh, forget this! Sitting
inside's boring, so let's go
DO something already!
Seven
440013_1_a
Ahaha...
Rain
440011_21_a
S-Sass?!
Seven
440011_20_a
Yeah! Don't try 'n' act all cool,
Seven! No one likes a kid with
sass!
Sphica
440011_19_a
Ouch, Seven, that hurt!
Don't rain on our Leprechaun
parade, okay?
Rain
440011_18_a
But this is a VRMMO
we've got
visuals, so dress it up all you
want-a swamp's still a swamp.
Seven
440011_17_a
Hmph. In other words, it's just a
cool-sounding name you came
up with for flavor.
Seven
440011_16_a
Thus, the name is a celebration of
we Leprechauns' pride in our skill
and craft!
Rain
440011_15_a
And Leprechaun bladecraft
transcends mere common smithery!
We are artistes!
Rain
440011_14_a
But weapons aren't just totally
awesome monster-slicers
they're also works of art!
Rain
440011_13_a
But people around here don't JUST
make weapons, right? Shouldn't it
be "City of Smiths" or something?
Seven
440011_12_a
As in, this is where the metal
magic happens! Everything from
smelting to weaponsmithing!
Rain
440011_11_a
The City of Bladewrights?
Sphica
440011_10_a
Yup! Leprechauns are renowned
smiths, and water is crucial for
the City of Bladewrights.
Rain
440011_9_a
Hmm... But there's a reason for
that, isn't there?
Seven
440011_8_a
Unlike Arun or the Sylph lands,
this area's definitely not a cozy
place for a picnic.
Rain
440011_7_a
Leprechaun territory is smack-dab
in the middle of a giant,
landlocked swamp.
Rain
440011_6_a
Ahaha! Nice one, Sphica!
But hey, what can you do?
Rain
440011_5_a
Yeah! It's really got the blues!
Sphica
440011_4_a
Rain
440011_3_a
Sphica
440011_2_a
bg_s2_20_restaurant
This place is wallowing in a
perpetual blue funk, huh?
Seven
440011_1_a
Same. We'll happily accept this
reward!
Asuna
350068_27_a
Ahh, now THIS is the ending I
wanted to see!
Kirito
350068_26_a
Thank you for helping me see the
light. Here, take this as a token
of my gratitude.
King
350068_25_a
Strange travelers, you have my
deepest apologies. I loved my
queen so much that I grew mad...
King
350068_24_a
Yeah. That would have been
regrettable. Probably.
Sinon
350068_23_a
Honestly, I don't follow, but at
least we don't have to lead a
coup.
Kirito
350068_22_a
Hehe, I'm glad it all worked out.
I guess love conquers everything?
Even though it was the problem?
Asuna
350068_21_a
Wow, that was cheesy. It was like
watching the worst Renaissance-era
romantic fluff.
Sinon
350068_20_a
I... I love you too! I'm so sorry!
King
350068_19_a
And the reason is simple. Because
I love you, and no other.
Queen
350068_18_a
With my own will and my own heart,
I will always return to your side.
Queen
350068_17_a
Even if the heavens themselves try
to separate us... Yes, even if you
try to separate us...
Queen
350068_16_a
...
King
350068_15_a
Your fear is unnecessary.
You locked me deep underground,
and still I return to you.
Queen
350068_14_a
Thus, I cannot allow anyone, even
our retainers, to see you! And
ESPECIALLY not filthy invaders!
King
350068_13_a
If I let the unwashed masses gaze
upon your celestial beauty... Why,
I cannot even bear to imagine it!
King
350068_12_a
Urk... I cannot do that!
You're just too beautiful!
King
350068_11_a
So please, go back to the kind
and gentle man I used to know.
Queen
350068_10_a
My love... I never want to leave
your side.
Queen
350068_9_a
You should've seen it, it was
frightening. Anyway, we'll just be
back here. Take it away, Queen.
Kirito
350068_8_a
Asuna
350068_7_a
Kirito
350068_6_a
That moldy cell was practically
falling apart. I just kicked the
wall down, and voila.
Sinon
350068_5_a
What?! You again?!
How did you escape?!
King
350068_4_a
Those you just locked in the
dungeon brought me to see you.
Queen
350068_3_a
Wh-What are you doing here?!
King
350068_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
My love...
???
350068_1_a
Easy. We just convince the king to
repent from his creepy ways. And I
know just how to do it, too...
Kirito
350067_28_a
You do? How?
Sinon
350067_27_a
Riiight. Okay, I see what we've
got to do here.
Kirito
350067_26_a
That's when he imprisoned me
in this dank dungeon...
Queen
350067_25_a
When he forbid me from even seeing
my parents, I spoke harsh words
to him.
Queen
350067_24_a
So, long story short, he's an
obsessed stalker-slash-sociopath?
Sinon
350067_23_a
Uh... What?
Asuna
350067_22_a
Eventually, he locked me in here
and did everything in his power
to keep others away...
Queen
350067_21_a
But that love became his downfall.
It drove him mad.
Queen
350067_20_a
The king was rather old to marry,
but he loved me like no other.
Queen
350067_19_a
After the king and I were wed,
we had many a happy day
together...
Queen
350067_18_a
What's the queen doing in a dirty
old dungeon like this?
Asuna
350067_17_a
Though I may not look it in here,
I'm the queen.
???
350067_16_a
Try turning around. There's a
beautiful lady in that cell
across the way.
Sinon
350067_15_a
Er, am I going crazy, or did I
just hear a woman's voice?
Kirito
350067_14_a
It's all my fault...
???
350067_13_a
Yeah, I got that feeling too...
Kirito
350067_12_a
Besides, that king... I think he
was afraid of something.
Sinon
350067_11_a
Yeah. If the king was a monster,
he wouldn't have captured us.
He'd have us killed on the spot.
Sinon
350067_10_a
That does happen a lot, but I
don't think that's the case this
time.
Asuna
350067_9_a
So, I was thinking. In a lot of
games, the king gets replaced by
a demon or something, right?
Kirito
350067_8_a
Yeah... I just hope we can find
a better way to end this than
regicide.
Asuna
350067_7_a
Eh. I've seen worse. Besides,
it looks like you were right.
This is part of the story.
Sinon
350067_6_a
So this is prison. Neat.
Kirito
350067_5_a
Asuna
350067_4_a
Sinon
350067_3_a
Kirito
350067_2_a
bg_04_inn_bed
Come with us! You're going to rot
in the dungeon until the day of
your execution.
Card Soldier
350067_1_a
Yeah, let's do it.
Asuna
350065_23_a
Sure, fine. I'd feel slightly bad
about mowing down all these
poor saps.
Sinon
350065_22_a
Hmm... Should we let ourselves
get caught? It might move the
story forward.
Kirito
350065_21_a
Capture them! We'll execute
them later, as an example
to our enemies!
King
350065_20_a
The queen, huh? This is the throne
room, but I don't see her.
Kirito
350065_19_a
And they also mentioned that he
changed right after he married the
young queen...
Asuna
350065_18_a
They said this king was a really
kind person until just recently.
Asuna
350065_17_a
Wait, guys!
I just remembered something!
Asuna
350065_16_a
...
Asuna
350065_15_a
Okay, I know you're having a moral
dilemma here, but they're coming
this way. Fight, or no fight?
Sinon
350065_14_a
Well, he finally noticed us.
Do we really have to fight?
Kirito
350065_13_a
You there! Who are you?!
Intruders?! Seize them!
Seize theeem!!
King
350065_12_a
Well, we gathered all the info we
could here, and it seems like
that's what we're supposed to do.
Kirito
350065_11_a
But isn't that a rather...violent
solution?
Asuna
350065_10_a
Why not? The people want to pull
this king down. And from what I
can see, I don't blame them.
Sinon
350065_9_a
Hey... I know that captain asked
us to beat up the king for him,
but is that the right thing to do?
Kirito
350065_8_a
He does seem pretty tyrannical.
His soldiers don't look very
happy either...
Asuna
350065_7_a
Kirito
350065_6_a
Asuna
350065_5_a
So that's the king.
Sinon
350065_4_a
Y-Yes, milord... But, you see...
Card Soldier
350065_3_a
Curse you, you useless fools!
Can't you do anything right?
Destroy the intruders, already!
King
350065_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
This kingdom is mine, you hear me!
MINE! I will not tolerate this
foreign blight upon my land!
King
350065_1_a
Captain, would you mind filling us
in on the whole story?
Kirito
350063_24_a
This country is closed to the rest
of the world?
Asuna
350063_23_a
The king put an end to all of
that when he closed the borders
of our kingdom...
Card Captain
350063_22_a
But don't feel bad. This country
once welcomed people like you
as friends, not enemies.
Card Captain
350063_21_a
...
Asuna
350063_20_a
Because I failed in my duty
and allowed you intruders
to infiltrate our kingdom!
Card Captain
350063_19_a
Why?
Kirito
350063_18_a
Not anymore, at least. The king
just dishonorably discharged me.
Oh, woe is me...
Card Captain
350063_17_a
So...the captain of the Card
Soldiers?
Kirito
350063_16_a
I am in charge of these brave
soldiers.
???
350063_15_a
He's dressed funny.
Sinon
350063_14_a
We are? Oh, I guess we are!
Who is this guy?
Another Card Soldier?
Asuna
350063_13_a
So, you're the intruders I've
heard so much about.
???
350063_12_a
I guess you're right. The devs
wouldn't just make players the
bad guys like that for no reason.
Kirito
350063_11_a
They added in this new dungeon for
us players. There's no way we're
not going to play it.
Sinon
350063_10_a
Okay, no. That doesn't make sense.
Sinon
350063_9_a
Maybe... We did beat up a whole
bunch of his troops on the way
in here...
Asuna
350063_8_a
Hey... You don't think we're to
blame for all this, are you?
Kirito
350063_7_a
Yeah, and all the Card Soldiers
figure that if they're going to
get the axe, why bother working?
Sinon
350063_6_a
The king, who's apparently a total
jerk, said he's going to execute
all his worthless retainers.
Asuna
350063_5_a
I talked to most of the Card
Soldiers, and they all say the
same thing.
Asuna
350063_4_a
Sinon
350063_3_a
Asuna
350063_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Okay, let's go over what we've
all learned from our initial
recon of this place...
Kirito
350063_1_a
Uh... That's depressing.
What's going on here?
Kirito
350061_18_a
We're all going to die soon,
anyway...
Card Soldier
350061_17_a
Actually, you know what?
Who cares anymore?
Card Soldier
350061_16_a
But I guess we're invaders here,
so I'm not surprised it's all
fight, fight, fight...
Asuna
350061_15_a
Hopefully not... We must have
done it a thousand times back
in the labyrinth...
Asuna
350061_14_a
Do we have to do this whole poker
battle song and dance again?
Sinon
350061_13_a
More Card Soldiers?
Kirito
350061_12_a
Who are you?!
Identify yourselves!
Card Soldier
350061_11_a
You don't have to tell me twice!
Asuna
350061_10_a
So, let's go check it out already!
Kirito
350061_9_a
Well, all we know is that only
people who finished the main
maze can get there.
Kirito
350061_8_a
Perhaps it's the Card Soldiers'
home base?
Sinon
350061_7_a
And did you see that swanky
castle at the center, just
past the final room?
Kirito
350061_6_a
Yeah. We made it to the end of the
dungeon, but there's still a lot
of places we haven't gone.
Asuna
350061_5_a
But from what I hear, there's
still a whole lot more fun to be
had in here!
Kirito
350061_4_a
Sinon
350061_3_a
Asuna
350061_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
So, we managed to finish the 3D
Labyrinth...
Kirito
350061_1_a
Yui
350048_39_a
That means a lot to me.
Thanks, everyone!
Feliz
350048_38_a
I'm sure they'll all happily risk
their lives for you.
Kirito
350048_37_a
But if you ever get scared or
overwhelmed, you can always
rely on your friends.
Kirito
350048_36_a
You've decided to choose the life
of a warrior, Feliz. It can be a
rough path...
Kirito
350048_35_a
Sphica
350048_34_a
Seven
350048_33_a
Yeah, I saw! You did pretty good
out there.
Kirito
350048_32_a
Yui
350048_31_a
Thank you, Kirito... But I want
you to know I'm fine now.
I can fight.
Feliz
350048_30_a
Kirito
350048_29_a
So you came to check on Feliz?
That's nice of you!
Sphica
350048_28_a
Sphica
350048_27_a
Seven
350048_26_a
Well... yeah. But it looks like
I didn't need to worry.
Kirito
350048_25_a
Feliz
350048_24_a
You were watching this whole time,
Daddy?
Yui
350048_23_a
So you noticed, huh?
Kirito
350048_22_a
...
???
350048_21_a
Wouldn't you agree... Kirito?
Seven
350048_20_a
Sphica
350048_19_a
Hehe, that's for sure!
Seven
350048_18_a
Yui
350048_17_a
It's still pretty frightening,
but with all of you at my side,
I think I'm fine!
Feliz
350048_16_a
Seven
350048_15_a
You're not scared anymore?
Sphica
350048_14_a
You sure did, Feliz!
You were very brave.
Yui
350048_13_a
Yui
350048_12_a
I... I did it! I beat a monster,
guys!
Feliz
350048_11_a
Graaaark!!
Monster
350048_10_a
Yah!
Seven
350048_9_a
Heh, not bad! Now, let me just
slip in there and finish it off!
Seven
350048_8_a
Seven
350048_7_a
It really was!
That was a critical hit!
Sphica
350048_6_a
Nice one, Feliz!
Yui
350048_5_a
Grawr?!
Monster
350048_4_a
Feliz
350048_3_a
Yui
350048_2_a
bg_04_field_flower_snow
Hiyah!
Feliz
350048_1_a
Besides, I think they've got
something good, and I don't
want to ruin that.
Kirito
350047_20_a
I don't want to leap into their
social circle and mess things up
either. I'll back off.
Kirito
350047_19_a
...Yeah.
Kirito
350047_18_a
We need to let them live their own
lives. We can keep an eye on them,
but we can't smother them.
Asuna
350047_17_a
Feliz has friends her own age to
be with now.
Asuna
350047_16_a
And you're right. You didn't say
it, but you thought it, and you're
right.
Asuna
350047_15_a
Asuna...
Kirito
350047_14_a
It makes me glad to know that you
feel like you can trust me enough
to tell me what's bothering you.
Asuna
350047_13_a
Well, you never complain to anyone
about anything, usually... except
me.
Asuna
350047_12_a
Huh? "Thank you"?
Where did that come from?
Kirito
350047_11_a
Hehehe. Thank you.
Asuna
350047_10_a
I know I'm just projecting my
feelings of insecurity onto her,
but I can't help it...
Kirito
350047_9_a
I'm only saying that because she
reminds me so much of Sachi.
Kirito
350047_8_a
I wanted to tell her she doesn't
have to, but...
Kirito
350047_7_a
Oh... Yui told me what happened.
She got scared and couldn't fight,
right?
Asuna
350047_6_a
I...was just thinking about Feliz.
Kirito
350047_5_a
You look upset, Kirito.
What's wrong?
Asuna
350047_4_a
Asuna
350047_3_a
bg_05_danac
...
Kirito
350047_2_a
bg_black
Fighting is really...scary...
Sachi
350047_1_a
...
Kirito
350045_34_a
Kirito
350045_33_a
Yui
350045_32_a
O-Okay... Thanks for the support,
everyone...
Feliz
350045_31_a
And if you get really scared, you
can always hide behind me!
I'll protect you!
Sphica
350045_30_a
You'll be a fighter in no time
you just need practice!
Seven
350045_29_a
Sphica
350045_28_a
Yeah! Don't let it get to you!
Seven
350045_27_a
It's okay, Feliz. It happens to
everyone their first time.
Yui
350045_26_a
When that monster got close,
I just froze...
Feliz
350045_25_a
Y-Yeah... Sorry...
Feliz
350045_24_a
Feliz! Are you okay?
Kirito
350045_23_a
Yui
350045_22_a
Feliz
350045_21_a
Grk!!
Monster
350045_20_a
Kirito
350045_19_a
Sphica
350045_18_a
Seven
350045_17_a
Nngh... Hrraaagh!!
Kirito
350045_16_a
It's really scary...
Feliz
350045_15_a
Yui
350045_14_a
B-But...
Feliz
350045_13_a
Just whack it with your sword and
it'll fall over in no time flat.
Seven
350045_12_a
That thing's a total pushover.
Seven
350045_9_a
Sphica
350045_11_a
Kirito
350045_10_a
Sphica
350045_8_a
Seven
350045_7_a
...
Kirito
350045_6_a
O-Okay!
Feliz
350045_5_a
Feliz! We found a monster!
Yui
350045_4_a
Yui
350045_3_a
Feliz
350045_2_a
bg_04_field_flower_snow
Graaawr!
Monster
350045_1_a
Ugh, what were we JUST
talking about?
Asuna
350043_19_a
Oh, but can I tag along on her
first fight?! Please?!
Kirito
350043_18_a
Great! Glad to hear you say that.
Yui
350043_17_a
I'm not exactly sure why you're
asking me. In the end, it's all
her decision.
Kirito
350043_16_a
So Daddy, is it all right for
Feliz to go fight?
Yui
350043_15_a
Yeah, I know...
Sorry, I'll stop...
Kirito
350043_14_a
Think about it! Yui's in the same
boat as Feliz, right? You're not
making a fuss over her!
Asuna
350043_13_a
You're being WAY too
overprotective.
Asuna
350043_12_a
Ugh, this again?
I thought we talked this over.
Asuna
350043_11_a
I know that, but...
I'm still worried about her.
Kirito
350043_10_a
In other words, we don't have to
worry about her dying for good,
or getting deleted.
Yui
350043_9_a
As I mentioned before, NPCs killed
in ALO can be resurrected.
Yui
350043_8_a
I agree.
Yui
350043_7_a
And I think that's great. She's
her own person now
she can
do what she likes.
Asuna
350043_6_a
I guess that shiny new AI she got
is already having an effect on her
personality.
Asuna
350043_5_a
Yes, that's correct.
Yui
350043_4_a
Asuna
350043_3_a
Yui
350043_2_a
bg_05_danac
Feliz wants to fight?!
Kirito
350043_1_a
Sphica
350041_28_a
Ahaha...
Yui
350041_27_a
Feliz
350041_26_a
Oh, shut up! You're not a tank
either, you know!
Seven
350041_25_a
Yui
350041_24_a
Rescue her? You're not strong
enough to rescue anyone, Seven!
Sphica
350041_23_a
Hey, let her do what she wants.
Besides, we can always swoop in
and rescue her in a pinch.
Seven
350041_22_a
Seven
350041_21_a
Well... I feel bad that I'm always
relying on everyone to protect me.
Feliz
350041_20_a
Why do you want to go and fight?
Sphica
350041_19_a
Yui
350041_18_a
But you're an Undine, right? You
guys specialize in support magic.
Sphica
350041_17_a
Feliz
350041_16_a
Ooh, that's what I like to hear!
Go get 'em, girl!
Seven
350041_15_a
Sphica
350041_14_a
Really?
Yui
350041_13_a
Seven
350041_12_a
Oh... Actually, if it's all right,
I'd... like to try fighting.
Feliz
350041_11_a
Is there anything you want to try,
Feliz? Now that your AI has been
upgraded, you should experiment!
Yui
350041_9_a
Sphica
350041_10_a
I think both of your ideas
sound fun.
Feliz
350041_8_a
Guess what?! My sister's going
to be in the next one! Cool,
right?
Seven
350041_7_a
I want to head to the arena and
watch some tournaments!
Seven
350041_6_a
Feliz
350041_5_a
I'm so over hide and seek.
And you always win anyway, Sphica.
Seven
350041_4_a
Somewhere we can play hide
and seek!
Sphica
350041_3_a
Sphica
350041_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Where should we go today?
Yui
350041_1_a
Sounds good.
Eugeo
350028_28_a
Ha ha, for sure.
So, now that everything's back to
normal, want to get out of here?
Kirito
350028_27_a
That sorcerer only let his guard
down because we were so
nonthreatening.
Eugeo
350028_26_a
Hehe, that was a surprise.
Still, it worked to our advantage.
Eugeo
350028_25_a
Last time I used this spell,
I turned into this huge, scary
monster... It was awesome!
Kirito
350028_24_a
Yeah, but I still can't believe my
spell turned us into those tiny
little mini-monsters!
Kirito
350028_23_a
I'm just happy we put a stop
to that sorcerer's evil plot.
Eugeo
350028_22_a
Another day, another victory!
Kirito
350028_21_a
Grrrrrr...
Sorcerer
350028_20_a
Choose wisely!
Eugeo
350028_19_a
So, you have two choices. You can
leave quietly, or you and this
sword can get better acquainted.
Eugeo
350028_18_a
Nope! We're intruders!
And we're here to stop
your devious little plan.
Kirito
350028_17_a
Wha-?!
H-Hey! You're not monsters!
Sorcerer
350028_16_a
Also, checkmate.
Kirito
350028_15_a
Kirito
350028_14_a
Surprise?
Eugeo
350028_13_a
Now, I shall release the bestial
rage sleeping within you!
Arise, fury! Muhahaha...ha?
Sorcerer
350028_12_a
Rawr! Rawwwr!
???
350028_11_a
Very well. You may approach.
Sorcerer
350028_10_a
But I suppose I have enough brutes
to command. I need eyes more than
strength to find those fairies.
Sorcerer
350028_9_a
I've seen pies bigger than you.
Sorcerer
350028_8_a
Your enthusiasm is appreciated,
but aren't you rather...small?
Sorcerer
350028_7_a
Rawr!
???
350028_6_a
Hrm? What do you two want?
Are you volunteering?
Sorcerer
350028_5_a
Raaawr!
???
350028_4_a
Rawr! Rawr!
???
350028_3_a
Bah! I need more slaves!
Sorcerer
350028_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
The intruders STILL haven't
been found?! Useless!!
Useless useless useless!
Sorcerer
350028_1_a
N-No way...
Kirito
350027_23_a
Seiya rauza nokt dept,
auger brott svart!
Kirito
350027_22_a
Right, here we go...
Kirito
350027_21_a
Okay, got it.
Eugeo
350027_20_a
It won't change your abilities or
anything. It's just an illusion.
Kirito
350027_19_a
Great! I'll cast it and see what
happens! So you know, this spell
only changes the way you look.
Kirito
350027_18_a
Anything's fine. I just want to
hurry up and stop that sorcerer.
Eugeo
350027_17_a
I can't really control
what happens, haha...
Kirito
350027_16_a
Oh, totally. I've done it
once before. I wonder how 
it'll turn out this time?
Kirito
350027_15_a
Is that even possible?!
Eugeo
350027_14_a
Then we just have to change
the way we look.
Kirito
350027_13_a
But how? I don't think either of
us looks very monstrous.
Eugeo
350027_12_a
Eugeo, you're a genius!
That's exactly what we'll do!
Kirito
350027_11_a
I ain't sayin' nothin'!
Kirito
350027_10_a
If only we could disguise
ourselves as monsters, we'd
be able to get close...
Eugeo
350027_9_a
A cowardly tactic. But looking at
that twisted grin on his face,
he'd do it. We need a plan.
Eugeo
350027_8_a
If we charge him, he'll just use
his unwilling servants as shields.
Kirito
350027_7_a
I think so, but it's not going to
be easy.
Kirito
350027_6_a
How horrible. But if we defeat
him, the creatures under his
control will be set free, right?
Eugeo
350027_5_a
From the looks of it, he's using
some kind of magic to turn them
into puppets.
Kirito
350027_4_a
A mad sorcerer is brainwashing
demons. "Bad" is an
understatement.
Kirito
350027_3_a
Kirito
350027_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Th-This is bad!
Eugeo
350027_1_a
Now go, my pathetic puppet!
Rampage! Kill! Destroy!
???
350025_28_a
Guhahaha! Good, good!
A monster needs no mind!
???
350025_27_a
RRRRRRAAAGGGH!!
Demon
350025_26_a
GnRk?!
GGGGrrraaAAGHN!!
Demon
350025_25_a
Krakirzyrk arxyrgron!
???
350025_24_a
Hmph. Foolish beast.
It is futile to resist.
???
350025_23_a
Hmm? You dare resist ME?!
???
350025_22_a
Grrnk... GrrrNK!!
Demon
350025_21_a
You there, fiend. Kneel before
your master! Find the intruders,
and tear them limb from limb!
???
350025_20_a
Grnnngk...
Demon
350025_19_a
Let them come. We shall show
them the meaning of pain...
???
350025_18_a
Kirito
350025_17_a
Eugeo
350025_16_a
Heh heh heh...
I smell the blood of the fey folk.
???
350025_15_a
Kirito
350025_14_a
Yeah, you're right. And there are
a bunch of demons gathering
around it...
Eugeo
350025_13_a
Hey, check that out.
It looks like an...altar?
Kirito
350025_12_a
R-Right... Now you tell me...
Eugeo
350025_11_a
In other words, keep your voice
down.
Kirito
350025_10_a
If we make too much noise,
they'll find us, spell or no.
Kirito
350025_9_a
Ha ha, I feel you there.
Also, not to scare you, but my
stealth spell isn't foolproof.
Kirito
350025_8_a
Yeah, but it's kind of completely
terrifying to just stroll through
the enemy's lair like this...
Eugeo
350025_7_a
Those monsters shouldn't be able
to see us at all.
Kirito
350025_6_a
Totally.
I cast stealth magic on us.
Kirito
350025_5_a
H-Hey Kirito, are you sure this
is a good idea?
Eugeo
350025_4_a
Wait...
Kirito
350025_3_a
Kirito
350025_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Wait...
Eugeo
350025_1_a
I was just about to suggest the
same thing.
Kirito
350023_27_a
I have the sinking suspicion that
there's more to this than meets
the eye...
Eugeo
350023_26_a
Hey Kirito...
Want to gather some more intel?
Eugeo
350023_25_a
So maybe something in that cave is
driving them to violence again?
Kirito
350023_24_a
Hmm... Maybe. When we conquered
the castle, most of the monsters
stopped attacking people.
Kirito
350023_23_a
Are you saying some outside force
was manipulating them?
Eugeo
350023_22_a
Yeah... It was almost like they
weren't in control of themselves.
Kirito
350023_21_a
You know, I got the impression
they weren't even after us. They
were just charging around blindly.
Eugeo
350023_20_a
It's hard to fight a rampaging
horde of fearless enemies, but
individually they aren't tough.
Kirito
350023_19_a
Oh, right. Well, these monsters
are a serious pain to deal with.
Kirito
350023_18_a
So, what were you trying to tell
me earlier?
Eugeo
350023_17_a
Yeah... Phew...
Kirito
350023_16_a
pant
... 
pant
...
I think we finally lost them...
Eugeo
350023_15_a
Got it!
Eugeo
350023_14_a
O-Okay, fight now, talk later!
Let's get outta here!
Kirito
350023_13_a
GRAAARGH!!
Demon
350023_12_a
Well, they-
Kirito
350023_11_a
Huh? What do you mean?
Eugeo
350023_10_a
Yeah... But their ferocity doesn't
translate to strength.
Kirito
350023_9_a
No matter how many of them we take
out, they just keep coming.
It's like they know no fear!
Eugeo
350023_8_a
You can say that again!
They're berserk!
Eugeo
350023_7_a
Y-Yeah, but these guys are
crazy...
Kirito
350023_6_a
Kirito, are you all right?!
Eugeo
350023_5_a
Nngh!
Kirito
350023_4_a
Eugeo
350023_3_a
Kirito
350023_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Grrrrraawr!!
Demon
350023_1_a
Count me in. But can we please
be careful for once?
Eugeo
350021_17_a
So how about you and I head in and
do some reconnaissance? Know thy
enemy, right?
Kirito
350021_16_a
Yeah. Everyone else is busy
right now, though.
Kirito
350021_15_a
A cave? That's news to me.
Well, I guess we have to head
back and deal with them.
Eugeo
350021_14_a
They were hiding in a big cave
underneath the castle.
Kirito
350021_13_a
Really? Where?
Eugeo
350021_12_a
But apparently, a swarm of vicious
beasts is still lurking in the
castle.
Kirito
350021_11_a
There sure is. We thought that
all the remaining monsters were
mostly harmless...
Kirito
350021_10_a
Thanks for that, by the way.
So... Why do you mention it?
Is there a problem?
Eugeo
350021_9_a
Well, we thought we'd pretty
much pacified the place.
Kirito
350021_8_a
Remember how we finally beat
the Dread Bastion?
Kirito
350021_7_a
Oh, hey Eugeo.
Kirito
350021_6_a
Yui
350021_5_a
Hey Kirito, what's wrong?
Eugeo
350021_4_a
Sure thing...
Yui
350021_3_a
Yui
350021_2_a
bg_17_forest
That's worrisome...
Kirito
350021_1_a
Hehe, good idea!
Asuna
350018_14_a
We'll let her spread the official
name while she's making her
fortune from selling the info.
Kirito
350018_13_a
Ha ha, sure! Just make sure to
tell Argo once we've got it.
Kirito
350018_12_a
Well, don't just stand there!
Help me think of something!
Asuna
350018_11_a
That's a good idea. Hmm...
Something cool like your
"Skill Connect" would be nice...
Asuna
350018_10_a
But something's been bugging me...
Don't you think it's about time
you named your technique?
Kirito
350018_9_a
Hehehe. Well, I'm glad to hear
my training helped.
Asuna
350018_8_a
Without that experience,
I'm sure I wouldn't have
been able to do it.
Kirito
350018_7_a
It taught me how to read players'
movements, rhythm, and attack
motions a whole lot better.
Kirito
350018_6_a
No, really. You forcing me to join
all those big raid battles made
a huge difference.
Kirito
350018_5_a
Nah, you would've figured it out.
That "weaving your attack into
mine" idea was all yours.
Asuna
350018_4_a
I'd never have gotten this far
without you holding my hand
every step of the way.
Kirito
350018_3_a
Kirito
350018_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
The day has finally come, Kirito.
You've mastered my technique!
Asuna
350018_1_a
Yes, ma'am...
Kirito
350017_23_a
Too bad! Now get up and get a
move on! It's training time!
Asuna
350017_22_a
I'm mentally exhausted from trying
to keep track of everything back
there...
Kirito
350017_21_a
Besides, you can't get tired in a
VRMMO, right?
Asuna
350017_20_a
Nope, and no whining! You just got
back into your groove. It'd be a
waste to call it here.
Asuna
350017_19_a
What?! Now?! I'm exhausted!
Can we save it for tomorrow?
Kirito
350017_18_a
Hehe, I'm happy to hear it.
So let's head back for some
more technique training!
Asuna
350017_17_a
it was really good practice for
me. I'm glad I got the feel for
big group battles back.
Kirito
350017_16_a
Well, regardless of whether or not
this training's going to help me
with your technique,
Kirito
350017_15_a
Hehe, you're still no general.
Maybe one day you'll be able to
match my situational awareness.
Asuna
350017_14_a
I was struggling just to keep
an eye on my corner of the
battlefield...
Kirito
350017_13_a
You had time to keep an eye on me
while you were way up front taking
on that boss?
Kirito
350017_12_a
I think you've gotten back into
the hang of it. Those were some
good orders you gave back there.
Asuna
350017_11_a
Oh man, am I beat.
But hey, we did it.
Kirito
350017_10_a
Kirito
350017_9_a
Nice work, Kirito!
Asuna
350017_8_a
Hraaagh!!
Kirito
350017_7_a
Roger!
Player
350017_6_a
We can't let those enemy
reinforcements surround us!
Kirito
350017_5_a
Hey, you! Tank! Follow me!
Kirito
350017_4_a
Looks like a group of enemies are
trying to flank us...
Kirito
350017_3_a
Oh, I did? Sorry!
Player
350017_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
Hey! You let an enemy slip past
you!
Kirito
350017_1_a
Ha ha, I'll try to remember that.
Kirito
350015_23_a
but the most important part of my
technique is letting yourself fit
into a greater whole.
Asuna
350015_22_a
Now, I know you usually hate
having to match other players'
playstyles,
Asuna
350015_21_a
Exactly!
Asuna
350015_20_a
It's probably a good idea for me
to relearn how to work as part
of a larger team again.
Kirito
350015_19_a
Ouch... Well, I suppose it's good
for me. I haven't taken part in
many big battles since SAO.
Kirito
350015_18_a
Hehe, remember that old adage
about how we hurt the ones we
love? Well, sweetie, this'll hurt.
Asuna
350015_17_a
Whoa... Asuna, you're one
seriously strict teacher...
Kirito
350015_16_a
So if I can teach you how to work
with this chaotic gaggle, you'll
be able to work with anyone.
Asuna
350015_15_a
Yup! You were going on about how
you weren't much of a team player,
right?
Asuna
350015_14_a
We are? Waaait a sec, is that why
you called me out here today?
Kirito
350015_13_a
Hehe, does it matter? Today,
we're training you to work with
other people!
Asuna
350015_12_a
Can we really do this?
Kirito
350015_11_a
You gotta be kidding me.
We're not a raid party, we're
a mob.
Kirito
350015_10_a
Actually, no one. Apparently,
pretty much no one here knows
anyone else.
Asuna
350015_9_a
So, who's our fearsome leader
today?
Kirito
350015_8_a
Thirty, huh? Sounds like things
are going to get really messy
out there.
Kirito
350015_7_a
About thirty. Enough for a raid
party.
Asuna
350015_6_a
How many we got?
Kirito
350015_5_a
Whoa, that's a lot of players...
Kirito
350015_4_a
Asuna
350015_3_a
Kirito

murmur
murmur
Players
350015_1_a
N-No, I'm sure you can do it
if you try...
Asuna
350013_17_a
Maybe I'm just too much of a
solo player to master a co-op
attack...
Kirito
350013_16_a
I'm not holding out much hope that
I'll have an epiphany and master it.
Kirito
350013_15_a
You say that, but I've already
spent a lot of time practicing
with nothing to show for it.
Kirito
350013_14_a
Great! I'm sure you'll be able to
grasp the basics in no time!
Asuna
350013_13_a
Yeah, you're completely right.
So I'm going to get serious about
learning it.
Kirito
350013_12_a
That's why my technique is perfect
for those situations. No getting
in the way.
Asuna
350013_11_a
it's really easy to get in each
other's way. That means your
attack options are limited...
Asuna
350013_10_a
When you have a bunch of players
facing off against a single giant
boss monster,
Asuna
350013_9_a
Umm, don't take this the wrong
way, but duh? I've been saying
that for days now.
Asuna
350013_8_a
I realized your technique is an
invaluable weapon during chaotic
battles like that boss fight.
Kirito
350013_7_a
Okay, I didn't pout, but yes.
I did say that. Let's move on.
Kirito
350013_6_a
Didn't you give up on it?
Asuna
350013_5_a
I distinctly remember you pouting
and saying "this technique just
isn't my style."
Asuna
350013_4_a
Huh? What caused this sudden
change of heart?
Asuna
350013_3_a
Asuna
350013_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
I guess... Anyway, I think that
I'd like to master your technique
after all...
Kirito
350013_1_a
Hehe, you've changed, Kirito.
A little, anyway.
Asuna
350011_25_a
Y-Yeah... Sorry we messed up
the plan...
Player
350011_24_a
Hey guys! Sorry about that!
But there's always next time,
right?
Kirito
350011_23_a
Buuut I guess we should go offer
them a word or two of consolation.
Kirito
350011_22_a
The old solo me would've said
it was their own fault for not
following the plan...
Kirito
350011_21_a
Yeah, but I kinda feel bad that
we robbed those guys of the
last attack bonus...
Asuna
350011_20_a
Phew... We did it.
Kirito
350011_19_a
Asuna
350011_18_a
Kirito
350011_17_a
Graaawwwrrr!!
Monster
350011_16_a
Great, let's do this!
Kirito
350011_15_a
You got it!
Asuna
350011_14_a
Asuna! Let's try out your new
technique!
Kirito
350011_13_a
I knew it'd start changing up its
attacks once it got into the
red...
Kirito
350011_12_a
Come on! Why'd it change attack
patterns at the last second!
That's so cheap!
Player
350011_11_a
Grrrrrr!!
Monster
350011_10_a
See? I told you so!
Kirito
350011_9_a
Gaaaaaah!!
Player
350011_8_a
GrrrAAARGH!!
Monster
350011_7_a
We don't have much HP left,
but neither does it! If we can
just-
Player
350011_6_a
N-Not gonna happen! We'll lose
our shot at the last attack bonus!
Player
350011_5_a
Hey! You guys in front, pull back!
Kirito
350011_4_a
Asuna
350011_3_a
Kirito
350011_2_a
bg_event_fire_cave
Graaawrk!!
Monster
350011_1_a
Ha ha! You got it.
Kirito
340098_31_a
Just promise you won't speed
around like that every time, okay?
Leafa
340098_30_a
Yeah. I hope I don't disappoint!
Kirito
340098_29_a
Haha! The captain's sure taken a
shine to you.
Asuna
340098_28_a
Leafa
340098_27_a
Asuna
340098_26_a
I will!
Kirito
340098_25_a
Keep up the good work, sharkbait!
Captain
340098_24_a
Leafa
340098_23_a
Asuna
340098_22_a
Whoa! I don't know what to say...
Thank you, captain!
Kirito
340098_21_a
You got a knack for steering.
I'm promoting you to official
helmsman!
Captain
340098_20_a
Nice work there, kiddo!
Captain
340098_19_a
Sinon
340098_18_a
Ha ha! Any time!
Yuuki
340098_17_a
Asuna
340098_16_a
Thank you, Yuuki.
Kirito
340098_15_a
Leafa
340098_14_a
Asuna
340098_13_a
And I owe you big time, Yuuki.
You brought me back to my senses.
Kirito
340098_12_a
Yeah! We all owe you big time,
Kirito!
Yuuki
340098_11_a
An armada that size would have
made chum of us in no time.
Sinon
340098_9_a
Yuuki
340098_10_a
Asuna
340098_8_a
Phew! That's a huge relief!
Leafa
340098_7_a
Woohoo!
Asuna
340098_6_a
Those dogs in the noble armada
gave up the chase!
Crew
340098_5_a
Leafa
340098_4_a
Asuna
340098_3_a
Kirito
340098_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
Cap'n!
We're in the clear!
Crew
340098_1_a
All right! Let's do this!
Hang on tight, because we're
going for a ride!
Kirito
340097_63_a
the technical aspects of sailing,
and forgot to let myself enjoy it!
Kirito
340097_62_a
Leafa
340097_61_a
Asuna
340097_60_a
Just have fun with it, huh?
You know, I think you're right.
I was getting too caught up in
Kirito
340097_59_a
Just let yourself feel the moment,
like you do when you're fighting!
And have fun with it!
Yuuki
340097_58_a
Sinon
340097_57_a
Well, you've already got the
sailing technique down. Now you
just need to let yourself use it.
Yuuki
340097_56_a
Leafa
340097_55_a
Asuna
340097_54_a
That's...an interesting idea...
Kirito
340097_53_a
Don't try to control the ship
let it become part of you!
Yuuki
340097_52_a
Maybe that'd help you too, Kirito.
Don't think, feel!
Yuuki
340097_51_a
I'm not fighting the wind. I'm a
bird, soaring through the sky
like my wings are a part of me.
Yuuki
340097_50_a
Sinon
340097_49_a
Well, whenever I'm flying,
I start thinking...
Yuuki
340097_48_a
Leafa
340097_47_a
Asuna
340097_46_a
Sure! I'm all ears!
Kirito
340097_45_a
Wanna hear me out?
Yuuki
340097_44_a
Kirito, I don't know how much help
this'll be, but I have an idea...
Yuuki
340097_43_a
...
Yuuki
340097_42_a
Yuuki
340097_41_a
I wish we could do more than
offer moral support.
Sinon
340097_40_a
You can do it, Kirito!
Asuna
340097_39_a
but this is ridiculous!
Kirito
340097_38_a
Don't get me wrong! I love a
good racing game as much as the
next guy,
Kirito
340097_37_a
Reading the wind and waves is the
easy part. Actually steering is
way harder!
Kirito
340097_36_a
Leafa
340097_35_a
Asuna
340097_34_a
Ha ha, that's the plan.
But controlling this thing's
harder than I thought.
Kirito
340097_33_a
Yuuki
340097_32_a
Are we going to get away?
Sinon
340097_31_a
Asuna
340097_30_a
So you are still at the helm!
Leafa
340097_29_a
Asuna! Guys!
Kirito
340097_28_a
Kirito
340097_27_a
Leafa
340097_26_a
Kirito!
Asuna
340097_25_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
Nngh!
Kirito
340097_24_a
Captain
340097_23_a
Leafa
340097_22_a
Right!
Asuna
340097_21_a
Yuuki
340097_20_a
To the tiller!
Sinon
340097_19_a
Asuna
340097_18_a
...Is gonna be in charge of
the escape!
Leafa
340097_17_a
We're laying on sail?
Then that means Kirito...
Asuna
340097_16_a
Aye-aye, cap'n!!
Crew
340097_15_a
Right men!
Raise the sails and hold on tight!
We're outrunning those swine!
Captain
340097_14_a
Challenging a fleet that size
would be suicide!
Captain
340097_13_a
That's right, captain!
Leafa
340097_12_a
A noble armada?!
Captain
340097_9_a
Leafa
340097_11_a
Asuna
340097_10_a
Leafa
340097_8_a
What'll the captain do?
I wonder if we'll fight?
Asuna
340097_7_a
Sinon
340097_6_a
There's so many of them...
There's no way we can win!
Yuuki
340097_5_a
Asuna
340097_4_a
I see them! Those masts...
It's those evil nobles!
Leafa
340097_3_a
Yuuki
340097_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
Look alive!
Enemy fleet off the starboard bow!
Sinon
340097_1_a
Yeah... I bet that'll make
him a great helmsman!
Yuuki
340095_34_a
That's just because he's
interested in it. He likes putting
theoretical stuff into practice.
Asuna
340095_33_a
But Kirito's still way better
at that technical stuff me.
Yuuki
340095_32_a
That's not true, Yuuki!
You're really good at picking up
new things!
Asuna
340095_31_a
Haha! That or I'm not that great
at learning new stuff in general!
Yuuki
340095_30_a
Maybe you're more of the
learn-by-doing type?
Asuna
340095_29_a
I couldn't get my head around
that theoretical stuff about
wings and sails, like you guys.
Yuuki
340095_28_a
Hehe, so you gave up?
Asuna
340095_27_a
O-Oh yeah, that.
It was hard, so...
Yuuki
340095_26_a
I thought you wanted to learn
about sailing with Kirito?
Asuna
340095_25_a
Hey, Asuna, what's up?
Yuuki
340095_24_a
Yuuki
340095_23_a
Hey, Yuuki?
Asuna
340095_22_a
Asuna
340095_21_a
Leafa
340095_20_a
Aye-aye, cap'n!!
Kirito
340095_19_a
So look alive and pay attention!
Captain
340095_18_a
Ships aren't just all wind and
sails. You gotta know how to
read the waves, too.
Captain
340095_17_a
Asuna
340095_16_a
Leafa
340095_15_a
Right!
Kirito
340095_14_a
Don't worry! The theory isn't
gonna be on the test. Next up,
you're learning the rudder.
Captain
340095_13_a
Yuuki
340095_12_a
Oh... Interesting. Actually doing
it makes it much easier to
understand.
Sinon
340095_11_a
Oh yeah! And we can fly even
faster that way than with the
wind at our backs!
Asuna
340095_10_a
Not flying straight against the
wind, but sort of zig-zagging
into it.
Leafa
340095_9_a
Asuna
340095_8_a
Kirito
340095_7_a
Ahh, I know this. It's the same
principle for wings.
Leafa
340095_6_a
Sinon
340095_5_a
Umm... Say that again, please?
When did I get off a pirate ship
and go to physics class?
Yuuki
340095_4_a
We use that lift to push forward,
and that's how we sail if the
wind's going the wrong way!
Captain
340095_3_a
That way, a layer of air comes in
underneath. That air builds up
and lifts the ship up a little.
Captain
340095_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
To sail against the wind,
you need to tack the sails at
just the right angle.
Captain
340095_1_a
Sinon
340093_32_a
Yay!
Yuuki
340093_31_a
Leafa
340093_30_a
Asuna
340093_29_a
Heh! Right on cue.
Kirito
340093_28_a
Next up I'll teach you how
to go the other way.
Captain
340093_27_a
So you caught the breeze?
Good job! That's all there is to
sailing with the wind.
Captain
340093_26_a
Leafa
340093_25_a
Asuna
340093_24_a
You know, I have no idea...
Kirito
340093_23_a
How does that work?
Yuuki
340093_22_a
Sinon
340093_21_a
But...ships can sail into the wind
too, right?
Yuuki
340093_20_a
Leafa
340093_19_a
Kirito
340093_18_a
Yeah... Before modern technology,
it was that or man the oars.
Asuna
340093_17_a
Yuuki
340093_16_a
So basically, the ship uses the
wind and the sails to get around.
Sinon
340093_15_a
Leafa
340093_14_a
Asuna
340093_13_a
Got it!
Kirito
340093_12_a
First lesson! Sail with the wind!
The first mate'll tell ya which
way it's blowing, so adjust right!
Captain
340093_11_a
Asuna
340093_9_a
Um... Sir! Aye-aye, sir!
Kirito
340093_8_a
Leafa
340093_10_a
Sinon
340093_7_a
Psst, Kirito!
You have to say "aye-aye."
Yuuki
340093_6_a
Leafa
340093_5_a
Asuna
340093_4_a
S-Sir! Yes, sir!
Kirito
340093_3_a
So I'm only gonna say this once!
Ya got that?!
Captain
340093_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
Sailing is an ancient, sacred,
and above all complicated art...
Captain
340093_1_a
Sinon
340091_37_a
Woohoo!
Yuuki
340091_36_a
Leafa
340091_35_a
Asuna
340091_34_a
Well, you heard the guy!
Kirito
340091_33_a
Time's a-wasting, sharkbait!
I don't care if you bring the
girls, just hurry up!
Captain
340091_32_a
Sinon
340091_31_a
Can I tag along too?
C'mon, pleeeaase?
Yuuki
340091_30_a
Sinon
340091_29_a
I want to steer the ship, too!
Yuuki
340091_28_a
Leafa
340091_27_a
Asuna
340091_26_a
I think Cap'n Misogyny here likely
has other speech options that
trigger in that case.
Kirito
340091_25_a
Yuuki
340091_24_a
What if an all-female party
came on this quest?
Sinon
340091_23_a
Leafa
340091_22_a
Asuna
340091_21_a
...I think we found our answer.
Kirito
340091_20_a
I knew I'd regret letting all you
dames aboard! Only a true man
can handle this here tiller!
Captain
340091_19_a
Ugh! There you go again,
nattering like harpies!
Captain
340091_18_a
Yuuki
340091_17_a
Hmmm...
I guess it was random?
Sinon
340091_16_a
Leafa
340091_15_a
Asuna
340091_14_a
No, I don't think so.
Kirito
340091_13_a
How come he picked you, Kirito?
Nothing about being a Spriggan
gives you an edge, does it?
Sinon
340091_12_a
Sinon
340091_11_a
Lucky!
Man, I wanted to do that...
Yuuki
340091_10_a
Asuna
340091_9_a
Wow! Go you, Kirito!
You must have impressed the cap'n!
Leafa
340091_8_a
Take the tiller? That means you're
steering the ship, right?
Asuna
340091_7_a
Huh?!
Me?
Kirito
340091_6_a
Leafa
340091_5_a
Asuna
340091_4_a
Kirito
340091_3_a
Sharkbait! How'd ye like to take
the tiller?!
Captain
340091_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
(Kirito and his friends found many
adventures waiting for them on
the high seas...)
340091_1_a
Yay!
Asuna
340088_28_a
How about we head back, then?
Yuuki
340088_27_a
Ah, I get it!
Ha ha, yeah. I guess so.
Yuuki
340088_26_a
And Kirito needs time
with his guy friends too.
Asuna
340088_25_a
Let's leave them be.
Two's a party, right?
Asuna
340088_24_a
Asuna...
Yuuki
340088_23_a
...
Asuna
340088_22_a
Maybe it's because he's finally
got a guy friend his age...?
Asuna
340088_21_a
Huh?
Yuuki
340088_20_a
It's been a long time since I saw
Kirito looking so carefree...
Asuna
340088_19_a
What's wrong, Asuna?
Yuuki
340088_18_a
W-Wait, Yuuki!
Asuna
340088_17_a
I know, right? That's why
I wanna join in.
Yuuki
340088_16_a
Yuuki
340088_15_a
They look like they're
having a nice time.
Asuna
340088_14_a
It's okay, Kirito! I can
take your word for it.
Eugeo
340088_13_a
Ah, sorry!
I forgot...
Kirito
340088_12_a
I wouldn't know. I don't have
any memories like that.
Eugeo
340088_11_a
Yeah... It's kinda like
catching bugs in the
forest as a kid, right?
Kirito
340088_10_a
Hehe... I thought I'd just
relax by the ocean, but
there's a lot to do here.
Eugeo
340088_9_a
Ha ha! And he got his revenge
by splashing you!
Kirito
340088_8_a
Aack!
He got away!
Eugeo
340088_7_a
Maybe if I'm quick
I can catch one...!
Eugeo
340088_6_a
With all the seaweed and
little fish, it's like a miniature
ecosystem.
Kirito
340088_5_a
Yeah! The environment around
here is so lifelike...
Kirito
340088_4_a
Wow... There are so many
different creatures here.
Eugeo
340088_3_a
Eugeo
340088_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Hey, cool! A crab!
Kirito
340088_1_a
Uh... Sure.
Asuna
340087_21_a
Asuna, let's go catch up with 'em!
Yuuki
340087_20_a
Grrr, no fair! Those guys went
off and ditched us!
Yuuki
340087_19_a
So much for not running around
outdoors in the sun...
Asuna
340087_18_a
So he didn't go back to
the guest house after all!
Yuuki
340087_17_a
I have, in fact. He was just
walking toward the ocean with
Eugeo.
Alice
340087_16_a
Hi, Alice! You haven't seen
Kirito, have you?
Asuna
340087_15_a
What's the matter, you two?
Alice
340087_14_a
I...really can't say...
Asuna
340087_13_a
Don't tell me he got sick of the
tent and went home!
Yuuki
340087_12_a
Where did he get off to?
Asuna
340087_11_a
Kirito's gone?!
Yuuki
340087_10_a
Yuuki
340087_9_a
What the...?
Asuna
340087_8_a
Sure...
Eugeo
340087_7_a
Huh? Uh, sure, I guess...
We can get lunch after that.
Kirito
340087_6_a
Want to check it out?
Eugeo
340087_5_a
It's much quieter over there.
It looks so peaceful...
Eugeo
340087_4_a
Yeah... This beach is
pretty famous.
Kirito
340087_3_a
Kirito
340087_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Looks like everyone's out
enjoying the beach today.
Eugeo
340087_1_a
I don't see why not.
Eugeo
340085_19_a
Ha ha, fair enough. Want to check
out the food stalls by the beach?
Kirito
340085_18_a
Thanks to your hospitality, I'm
feeling much better! Albeit
hungry.
Eugeo
340085_17_a
Oh, Eugeo! Are you feeling
rested up?
Kirito
340085_16_a
Yui
340085_15_a
Looks like you've got your
hands full, Kirito.
Eugeo
340085_14_a
Thanks, Yui...
Kirito
340085_13_a
That's my daddy!
Always working hard.
Yui
340085_12_a
s just I'm just never satisfied
until I really get my head around
something...
Kirito
340085_11_a
Ha ha, don't worry. I've already
finished the most important parts.
Kirito
340085_10_a
Even at the beach you have
to do real-world work...?
Poor Daddy!
Yui
340085_9_a
and do some homework...
Kirito
340085_8_a
Maybe I should give it
a rest for now
Kirito
340085_7_a
No hits so far.
Kirito
340085_6_a
I configured it to auto-search
and notify me whenever
there's new information, but...
Kirito
340085_5_a
I can't find any results for
Divine Objects, or even anything
similar...
Kirito
340085_4_a
What is it, Daddy?
Yui
340085_3_a
Yui
340085_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Mmmm...
Kirito
340085_1_a
Heh, that's the plan!
Kirito
340083_27_a
So you'll stay in this sun-shelter
and continue to investigate,
yes?
Alice
340083_26_a
Yes, that is indeed so...
Alice
340083_25_a
We've found two so far, but that
still leaves five, right?
Kirito
340083_24_a
...!
Alice
340083_23_a
I was looking to see if I could
find any information on where to
find the Divine Objects.
Kirito
340083_22_a
Erm... This helps me find
information about this world.
Kirito
340083_21_a
Why are you so taken
by that Stacia Window?
Alice
340083_20_a
Hehe, sorry...
Kirito
340083_19_a
It's surprising to think you're
the same man I fight alongside.
Alice
340083_18_a
At any rate, you seemed terribly
languorous when you were speaking
with Asuna just now.
Alice
340083_17_a
Blood Orange and Blue Hawaii...
Nice choices.
Kirito
340083_16_a
I was simply curious about the
range of different flavors. They
were both so colorful...
Alice
340083_15_a
N-No! Of course not!
Don't be ridiculous.
Alice
340083_14_a
But you got two of them.
Did you get this one to
share with me...?
Kirito
340083_13_a
They just happened to be selling
them over there.
Alice
340083_12_a
Uh, okay... Thanks for
the drink, though!
Kirito
340083_11_a
There's nothing more
to it than that.
Alice
340083_10_a
I felt sufficiently refreshed
and decided to head out.
Alice
340083_9_a
What are you doing here?
I thought you were at the house.
Kirito
340083_8_a
Alice
340083_7_a
Whaaa!!
A-Alice?!
Kirito
340083_6_a
Ah, thanks...
Kirito
340083_5_a
If you don't have any particular
preference, why not try one of
mine?
???
340083_4_a
I think I'll go buy some more.
Kirito
340083_3_a
Hm, looks like I finished
off my drink...
Kirito
340083_2_a
bg_event_seashore
sip sip
...
Kirito
340083_1_a
...
Kirito
340081_20_a
Will do.
Kirito
340081_19_a
Hehe, sure... Kirito, come find us
if you change your mind!
Asuna
340081_18_a
C'mon, Asuna! Let's go
have some actual fun!
Yuuki
340081_17_a
Oh, for cryin' out loud...
Have it your way, Kirito.
Yuuki
340081_16_a
I used to practice kendo, but even
that I consider to be an indoor
sport.
Kirito
340081_15_a
Eh, I'm more of a great indoors
kinda guy.
Kirito
340081_14_a
What's a summer vacation
without properly enjoying
the great outdoors?
Asuna
340081_13_a
It's not a good idea to be running
around outside in the hot sun.
Kirito
340081_12_a
Quit your vegetating! Let's go
stretch our legs already!
Yuuki
340081_11_a
but you've been gawking at
that HoloWindow since we
got here.
Yuuki
340081_10_a
Yeah! We're supposed to
be having a beach day,
Yuuki
340081_9_a
C'mon, Kirito, you've been
saying that all day!
Asuna
340081_8_a
Yuuki
340081_7_a
Asuna
340081_6_a
Just give me a minute...
Kirito
340081_5_a
Asuna
340081_4_a
Kirito!!
Yuuki
340081_3_a
Yuuki
340081_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Kiritoooo!
Asuna
340081_1_a
はい!
プレミア
340078_49_a
プレミアも付き合ってくれるか?
キリト
340078_48_a
このアイングラウンド製の
装備を試したいからな
キリト
340078_47_a
なるほどな
よし、早速なにか別のクエストに
行ってみようぜ
キリト
340078_46_a
村人を守り盗賊を倒すという
当初の目的に一番貢献したプレイヤー
に報酬が贈られるようですね
340078_45_a
このクエはユニーククエ、
受注者したパーティではなく、
340078_44_a
えーと……
そう言えば、結局どうして俺が
報酬をもらえたんだろう?
キリト
340078_43_a
あっ、そうだ!
キリト
340078_42_a
おいおい……勘弁してくれよ
キリト
340078_41_a
余計なコト……とはなんでしょう?
わたしには理解デキマセン
340078_40_a
わわっ!
ユ、ユイ……ママには
余計なこと言うなよ!?
キリト
340078_39_a
えーと、パパ……コホン
340078_38_a
ああ、もちろんだよ
プレミア
キリト
340078_37_a
あなたは同じように悲しみ……
そしてどうにか助けたいと
思ってくれますか?
プレミア
340078_36_a
キリト、もしわたしがまた
今の子のように窮地に立たされたとき
プレミア
340078_35_a
プレミア……
キリト
340078_34_a
わたしもできることをしたいと
思っただけです
プレミア
340078_33_a
いえ、キリトが人々を大切に
想う気持ちがよくわかったから……
プレミア
340078_32_a
いやプレミアが冷静に
アドバイスしてくれたおかげだよ
キリト
340078_31_a
キリト、おめでとうございます
プレミア
340078_30_a
おおっ……
これでクエスト完了だ!
新装備も手に入ったみたいだぞ!
キリト
340078_29_a
おっ……
なにか表示されて……
キリト
340078_28_a
キリト
340078_27_a
はい、やりましたね!
340078_26_a
よし、全員倒した!
キリト
340078_25_a
ぐぎゃああっ!!
盗賊Mob
340078_24_a
はい!
プレミア
340078_23_a
ああ、だが残り数人だ
俺たちでもなんとかなる
プレミアも頼んだぞ!
キリト
340078_22_a
オラオラ、死ねぇ!
盗賊Mob
340078_21_a
あ、ああ……
キリト
340078_20_a
無事に生き返ったみたいですね
プレミア
340078_19_a
わ、わたしは……どうして……?
村人NPC
340078_18_a
………………
村人NPC
340078_17_a
よし、じゃあこれを使って……!
キリト
340078_16_a
ああ、蘇生魔法は俺は
使えないけど……世界樹の雫のほうは
確か一つ持ってたはず!
キリト
340078_15_a
そ、そうです!
世界樹の雫です!
340078_14_a
蘇生アイテムに
蘇生魔法もありますよね?
プレミア
340078_13_a
えっ……あっ!
キリト
340078_12_a
この世界では死んでしまっても
時間が経過していなければ
命を復活させられますよね?
プレミア
340078_11_a
キリト、冷静になってください
わたしはこの世界に来て
色々なことを勉強したと言いました
プレミア
340078_10_a
ああ、それはもちろんだ……
けど俺は今……
キリト
340078_9_a
ですがキリトがこの世界の人たちを
大事に想っていること……
それはよくわかりました
プレミア
340078_8_a
プレミア……
キリト
340078_7_a
様々なことを知りました
でもキリトたちの言っていることは
まだ少しわからないことがあります
プレミア
340078_6_a
キリト……
わたしはアイングラウンドで生まれ
そしてALOにやってきて……
プレミア
340078_5_a
くそっ……くそっ……
キリト
340078_4_a
プレミア
340078_3_a
キリト
340078_2_a
bg_event_field
パパ……
340078_1_a
くそっ……!
俺は守れなかった……のか……?
キリト
340077_28_a
つまんねーの……
もう行こうぜ……
プレイヤーC
340077_27_a
なんだ……これで失敗か……
プレイヤーB
340077_26_a
村人が……殺された……
プレイヤーA
340077_25_a
あっ!!
キリト
340077_24_a
いやぁぁっ……!
村人NPC
340077_23_a
オラオラ、死ねぇ!!
盗賊NPC
340077_22_a
きゃああっ!
村人NPC
340077_21_a
キリト……
プレミア
340077_20_a
くっ……!
キリト
340077_19_a
失敗して報酬取れなくてもどうせ
また別のクエの報酬になるから、
そんなの気にする必要はねーよ!
プレイヤーC
340077_18_a
仮にそうだとしてもNPCを
守りながら戦うなんて
メンドくせーよ!
プレイヤーC
340077_17_a
あっ、そうか!
プレイヤーB
340077_16_a
これはユニーククエだ!
一時的マップ化しない以上、
一度失敗したらもう終わりなんだ!
キリト
340077_15_a
俺たち部外者も参加できることで
わかるだろう!?
キリト
340077_14_a
それよりも敵倒すほうを
優先すべきじゃねーのかよ!?
プレイヤーC
340077_13_a
どうせ失敗しても
また生き返るだろ!?
プレイヤーC
340077_12_a
村人を優先って言われても……
プレイヤーB
340077_11_a
あ、ああ……
プレイヤーA
340077_10_a
理由は後から説明する!
今は村人たちを守ることに
集中してくれ!
キリト
340077_9_a
あんたら……別パーティなのに
どうして手助けを……?
プレイヤーA
340077_8_a
た、助かりました
村人NPC
340077_7_a
ふぅ、間に合ったか……
キリト
340077_6_a
ぐぎゃっ!?
盗賊Mob
340077_5_a
ぜあああっ!!
キリト
340077_4_a
おらおら、死ねぇ!
盗賊Mob
340077_3_a
キリト
340077_2_a
bg_event_field
きゃああっ!
村人NPC
340077_1_a
はい!
プレミア
340075_42_a
二人とも行くぞ!!
キリト
340075_41_a
あ、ああ、そうだな!
今はまず村人たちを
助けることが先決だ!
キリト
340075_40_a
キリト、ユイ
なにをモタモタしてるんですか?
プレミア
340075_39_a
それなのに一時的マップ化しない
ってことはこれはユニーククエ
なのか!?
キリト
340075_38_a
あのプレイヤーさんたちが
クエストを受注したから
盗賊が出現したのでしょうか?
340075_37_a
おうよ!
プレイヤーC
340075_36_a
倒すわよ!
プレイヤーB
340075_35_a
よし!
村長の話を聞いたら
盗賊たちが出てきぜ!
プレイヤーA
340075_34_a
ほら、やっぱり
出てきたじゃないですか!
プレミア
340075_33_a
ど、どうして……?
俺たちはまだ受注してないのに!?
キリト
340075_32_a
えっ!?
キリト
340075_31_a
ハハッ!
襲え! 燃やせ!
そして奪え!!
???
340075_30_a
そ、それは……
キリト
340075_29_a
パパ、プレミアさんには
どう説明しましょうか?
340075_28_a
盗賊にこの村が襲われるという
情報が入っているのなら、
それは絶対に起こるんですよね?
プレミア
340075_27_a
わたしにはキリトの言っている
意味がわかりません……
プレミア
340075_26_a
受けなければ盗賊に襲われない……
戦いも起こらなければ村人たちが
殺されることもないってことだ
キリト
340075_25_a
だってそうだろう……?
このクエを受けてしまうことで
村が盗賊に襲われるなら……
キリト
340075_24_a
どういう意味ですか?
プレミア
340075_23_a
くっ……二人ともすまない
このクエストを受注していいのか……
確証が得られない
キリト
340075_22_a
あっ……!
キリト
340075_21_a
ああ、そうだな
じゃあお先に～
プレイヤーA
340075_20_a
先にやっちまおうぜ
プレイヤーC
340075_19_a
わたしたちのことのようです……
340075_18_a
ん、でもなんか
モタモタしてるぜ
プレイヤーC
340075_17_a
あそこに別のパーティがいるわよ
プレイヤーB
340075_16_a
おおっ、一番乗りみたいだな
プレイヤーA
340075_15_a
えっ?
キリト
340075_14_a
キリト、ユイ
あそこに別の集団が……
プレミア
340075_13_a
実装されたばかりのクエストで
情報も少ないですし……
340075_12_a
それは……わたしにも
なんとも言えません
340075_11_a
だが……このクエは……
どうなるんだ……?
キリト
340075_10_a
まぁ、気持ちの良いもんじゃ
ないけどな……
キリト
340075_9_a
すぐにリポップすることが
わかってるから、不安はない……
キリト
340075_8_a
俺は……妙な胸騒ぎがするんだ
仮に普通のクエなら
たとえNPCが殺されても……
キリト
340075_7_a
パパ……
340075_6_a
……なあ、ユイ
このクエストは本当に
やるべきなのか……?
キリト
340075_5_a
パパ、この先にある村長の家で
クエストが発生するみたいですね
340075_4_a
プレミア
340075_3_a
340075_2_a
bg_event_field
………………
キリト
340075_1_a
………………
プレミア
340073_25_a
そ、それは……!
340073_24_a
このクエストでNPCが
殺された場合は……どうなるんだ?
キリト
340073_23_a
仮にそのキャラに店主といった
役割が与えられている場合は、
別のキャラに擦り変わってしまう……
340073_22_a
ユニークキャラクターであるNPCが
死んでしまうと二度とそのキャラは
蘇らない……
340073_21_a
そ、そうでしたね
340073_20_a
それはNPCが全てユニークの
存在ということだ
キリト
340073_19_a
SA:Oは俺たちの知るこれまでの
VRMMOと大きく違うことが
あった……
キリト
340073_18_a
は、はい
340073_17_a
これはSA:O装備が手に入る
新クエストなんだよな?
キリト
340073_16_a
ユイ、ちょっと待ってくれ
キリト
340073_15_a
全員……
キリト
340073_14_a
説明文には
ただ全員守り切れと……
340073_13_a
それは……
失敗になるのではないでしょうか?
340073_12_a
えっ……!
キリト
340073_11_a
仮にその村人たちを……
守り切れなかった場合は
どうなるんですか?
プレミア
340073_10_a
ん、プレミアどうしたんだ?
キリト
340073_9_a
村人たちを……守る……
プレミア
340073_8_a
了解だ
キリト
340073_7_a
盗賊たちから村人たちを
守ることが目的ということです
340073_6_a
はい……その村が盗賊たちに
襲われることになるので、
340073_5_a
行ったことのない場所だな
キリト
340073_4_a
プレミア
340073_3_a
キリト
340073_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
新クエストは
この先の村で発生するようです
340073_1_a
じゃあ頼んだぜ
キリト
340071_18_a
はい、もちろんです
がんばりますね
プレミア
340071_17_a
ああ、どうかな?
協力してくれないか?
キリト
340071_16_a
キリト
340071_15_a

bg_18_tower_road
新クエストですか……
プレミア
340071_13_a
そうですね
340071_12_a
ああ、せっかくSA:Oの
クエなんだからプレミアを
連れていこうかな
キリト
340071_11_a
誰かに協力してもらいますか?
340071_10_a
なるほど、面白そうじゃないか
ちょっと受注してみようぜ
キリト
340071_9_a
はい、そのようですね
装備を手に入れるための
新しいクエストも実装されていますよ
340071_8_a
カーディナルが関連付けて
自動生成したってことか?
キリト
340071_7_a
あっ、もしかしてあの世界の
住人であるプレミアが
コンバートしてきたことで、
キリト
340071_6_a
SA:Oの……なんで?
キリト
340071_5_a
この間までパパたちがプレイしていた
SA:Oの特別装備が
実装されたみたいですね
340071_4_a
今度はどんなやつだ?
キリト
340071_3_a
キリト
340071_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
パパ、今日のオンメンテで
新しい要素が実装されたようです
340071_1_a
うん、きっと可愛いと思うよ
キリトくんのサンタ姿～!
アスナ
340058_16_a
ええっ!?
そ、それは困るぞ……
いやむしろそんなものでいいのかよ!
キリト
340058_15_a
ふふっ、じゃあサンタ姿の
SAOキリトくんが今年の
クリスマスプレゼントってことで
アスナ
340058_14_a
うーん、
とても似合うとは思えないけど、
せっかく手に入れたし着てみるか……
キリト
340058_13_a
男物だね
どうしよう……
キリトくん、着てみる?
アスナ
340058_12_a
はは、そうみたいだな
なんだかコスプレ衣装って感じだな
キリト
340058_11_a
item_event_santa_kirito
わっ……ええと、これって、
サンタクロースの衣装?
アスナ
340058_10_a
盗賊たちの置いていった宝って
感じだな
どれどれ……開けてみるか
キリト
340058_9_a
ああ、俺もだよ
キリト
340058_8_a
でもわたし達の思い出の場所……
初めてのクリスマスを過ごした場所を
守れてわたしは嬉しかったよ
アスナ
340058_7_a
まあ小規模クエの敵のセリフなんて、
あんなもんだろうな
キリト
340058_6_a
あはは……
最後の捨て台詞まで
お決まりのって感じだったね
アスナ
340058_5_a
………………
キリト

く、くそ!
覚えてやがれぇ!
340058_1_a
うん!
アスナ
340057_18_a
よし、俺たちも行くぞ!
キリト
340057_17_a
おいお前ら、やっちまえ!!
340057_16_a
ゴチャゴチャうるせーな!
340057_15_a
そうだね!
アスナ
340057_14_a
せっかくのクリスマスの雪景色なんだ
外観だけじゃなく中だって、
綺麗なままでいてほしいもんな
キリト
340057_13_a
アスナ……
ああ、そうだな
キリト
340057_12_a
こんな悪党たちに汚されるのを
見過ごすことはできないよ……!
アスナ
340057_11_a
だってここは……
わたし達やキズメルたちとの
大切な思い出の場所
アスナ
340057_10_a
でも手を抜くつもりはないよ
アスナ
340057_9_a
お決まりの台詞だな……
まあ予想どおりのミニクエスト
なんだろうけど
キリト
340057_8_a
さもねーと
痛い目に遭ってもらうぜぇ!
340057_7_a
ここは俺らのアジトだ!
出ていけ!
340057_6_a
そうみたいだね
アスナ
340057_5_a
あいつらがここを根城にしてる
盗賊たちか?
キリト
340057_4_a
アスナ
340057_3_a
キリト
340057_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
なんだテメーッ!
340057_1_a
うん!
アスナ
340055_30_a
そうだよな
よし、じゃあ早速行くか
キリト
340055_29_a
あんまり変なこと思い出すつもりは
ないよ
アスナ
340055_28_a
だって今はあくまでSAOの追体験を
するために、アバターアレンジ
したわけで、
アスナ
340055_27_a
そ、そうか……ならいいんだけど
キリト
340055_26_a
う、ううん
大丈夫だよ
アスナ
340055_25_a
ああっ!　ご、ごめん!
なんかイヤなこと思い出させたか?
キリト
340055_24_a
わたしのSAOアバターを元に
作ったんだろうし……
アスナ
340055_23_a
うん、そうだね
ティターニアのアバター自体も
アスナ
340055_22_a
むしろあれだ
妖精の姫君ティターニアに
近くなるんだよな
キリト
340055_21_a
そうかな?
アスナ
340055_20_a
だが否定できないのが痛いところだ
アスナは髪の色が変わるから、
印象だいぶ変わるよな
キリト
340055_19_a
ムッ……
キリト
340055_18_a
だってキリトくんのSAOアバター、
ALOのとそんなに
変わらないんだもん
アスナ
340055_17_a
な、なんだよ
いきなりこっち見て笑うなよ
キリト
340055_16_a
キリト
340055_15_a
あはは
アスナ
340055_14_a
キリト
340055_13_a
SAOのときの見た目に近く
設定変更できるし……
ちょっとやってみようか
アスナ
340055_12_a
そうだね
今のALOは二人とも
アバターアレンジで
アスナ
340055_11_a
飛べないんだし、ちょうどいいだろ
なんかほら……SAOの頃を
追体験できるって感じがしないか?
キリト
340055_10_a
えっ?
アスナ
340055_9_a
せっかくヨフェル城に来たんだから、
俺たちもSAOアバターに
してみないか?
キリト
340055_8_a
そうみたいだな……
キリト
340055_7_a
ふふっ、そうそう
あっ……暗いせいで飛行禁止エリアにも
なっちゃってるみたいだね
アスナ
340055_6_a
そうだな……
前のこの城ってすげーゴージャス
だったよな
キリト
340055_5_a
前のヨフェル城とはだいぶ
雰囲気が違うね
アスナ
340055_4_a
そ、そうだね
静かだし薄暗いし……
アスナ
340055_3_a
アスナ
340055_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
なんだか……
外観とは打って変わって、
城の中は随分不気味な感じだな
キリト
340055_1_a
アスナ
340053_18_a
よし、
じゃあせっかくだからやってみるか
ヨフェル城に行ってみよう
キリト
340053_17_a
そうかもね
アスナ
340053_16_a
それだけか?
エリアに入ったら発生する
ミニクエストみたいなもんかな……?
キリト
340053_15_a
《湖上の城を根城にする
悪党を排除してください》
だって
アスナ
340053_14_a
ちょっと内容を確認するね……
アスナ
340053_13_a
ホントだ……
なんか変なタイミングだな……
俺たちここに来ただけなのに……
キリト
340053_12_a
えっ?
これって……クエスト受注の音?
アスナ
340053_11_a
……!
キリト
340053_10_a
キリトくん……
アスナ
340053_9_a
ああ、俺も同じだよ、アスナ……
キリト
340053_8_a
わたしすごく幸せだよ
アスナ
340053_7_a
キリトくん……
前とは違うヨフェル城だけど、
またきみとここに来られて……
アスナ
340053_6_a
うん、前も感動したけど、
この景色も……すごいね……
アスナ
340053_5_a
湖畔に浮かぶ
白無垢の中世の古城か……
なんだか幻想的だな……
キリト
340053_4_a
うわぁ……
雪景色だ……
アスナ
340053_3_a
アスナ
340053_2_a
bg_event_yofel_castle
おおっ……
キリト
340053_1_a
ふふっ、うん!
いいね、それ!
早速行ってみよう!
アスナ
340051_13_a
ああ!
あのヨフェル城がこっちの4層にも
ないか探索してみたくなったんだ
キリト
340051_12_a
4層って新生アインクラッドの?
アスナ
340051_11_a
あっ、そうだ
アスナ、せっかくだから
4層に行ってみないか?
キリト
340051_10_a
うん……
アスナ
340051_9_a
そうだったな
なんだか懐かしいな……
もう遠い昔のことみたいだ
キリト
340051_8_a
あとはキズメルとも
再会させてくれた……
アスナ
340051_7_a
あのときキリトくんは、
クリスマスプレゼントとして霧に浮かぶ
ヨフェル城の景色を見せてくれたね
アスナ
340051_6_a
うん、忘れもしない
アインクラッドの4層で
二人で旅をしてたときだよ
アスナ
340051_5_a
クリスマス……か
俺たちの最初のクリスマスって……
キリト
340051_4_a
そうだね～
こうして街並みまで変わると、
ワクワクしちゃうよね
アスナ
340051_3_a
アスナ
340051_2_a
bg_event_alne_christmas
ALOもすっかり
クリスマス一色だな
キリト
340051_1_a
Yeah. I'll be right back.
Kirito
340038_27_a
Who knows? Maybe it's
something he needs to talk
to another guy about.
Asuna
340038_26_a
Hehehe, that might not be a bad
idea.
Asuna
340038_25_a
Haha, yeah...
But maybe I should go
talk to him just in case...
Kirito
340038_24_a
I think we better just leave him
be. He'll snap out of it and come
back like nothing happened.
Liz
340038_23_a
Should we do something?!
Go after him, maybe?
Silica
340038_22_a
I think he was crying.
Liz
340038_21_a
What's with him?
Barging in and then barging
right back out again...
Kirito
340038_20_a
Huh?
Klein?
Asuna
340038_19_a
D-Dammit all!
Klein
340038_18_a
Am I just not destined
for greatness?!
Klein
340038_17_a
You don't need anything like
Bloodbond when you were born
with natural allure...
Klein
340038_16_a
Tch...! I knew it...
That's the real deal...
Klein
340038_15_a
Over here, Klein.
Kirito
340038_14_a
...!
Klein
340038_13_a
Hey! Sorry to keep you waiting,
K-dawg!
Klein
340038_12_a
Hehehe, sounds like it.
Asuna
340038_11_a
It's weird, but definitely
fit for a vampire.
Kirito
340038_10_a
Ahahaha, seriously?!
Liz
340038_9_a
Just a general stat buff. Oh, and
it weakens you to crosses
and garlic...
Kirito
340038_8_a
So now what's its ability?
Leafa
340038_7_a
He said it was my payment for
helping him out and gave it
to me.
Kirito
340038_6_a
Klein said he didn't need it?
Silica
340038_5_a
Yep...
Kirito
340038_4_a
Silica
340038_3_a
Kirito
340038_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
What? So, YOU ended up getting
the vampire equipment after all
that?!
Asuna
340038_1_a
Hell yeah! I knew you had my back!
Klein
340037_17_a
Alright.
Then I'm still in this too.
Kirito
340037_16_a
I can't call myself a gamer if I
can't even finish a simple quest!
Klein
340037_15_a
No, I wanna see it through to the
end. Bailing in the middle would
just suck.
Klein
340037_14_a
Knowing that you won't get the
ability you want after all this
has to be pretty discouraging...
Kirito
340037_13_a
So, um... What do you want to do?
This quest is pretty tough, so
maybe we should call it quits.
Kirito
340037_12_a
S-Sorry...
Kirito
340037_11_a
Hey, who're you calling a fool?!
Klein
340037_10_a
But are you telling me you knew
this was a fool's errand
from the very beginning?
Kirito
340037_9_a
Oh, uh... I don't know. I've
never given it much thought...
Kirito
340037_8_a
Haven't you ever wanted to be
Mr. Tall Dark and Handsome,
surrounded by beautiful women?
Klein
340037_7_a
But still, you get why I had to
try, right? Chicks totally dig
that air of mystery and danger!
Klein
340037_6_a
Oh...yeah. I mean,
I knew that already.
Klein
340037_5_a
It'll probably change into
something else the minute that
item lands in your inventory.
Kirito
340037_4_a
on getting that vampire's
Bloodbond ability.
Kirito
340037_3_a
Klein
340037_2_a
bg_event_halloween_castle
...So that's basically it.
You should probably give up
Kirito
340037_1_a
I need to go talk to him...
Kirito
340035_23_a
gulp
I hate to admit it,
but you're right...
Asuna
340035_22_a
Yeah, SHOULD. But he's kind of...
a creeper when it comes to NPCs
he crushes on...
Kirito
340035_21_a
Both? I mean, that ability carries
pretty deep ethical implications
that even Klein should understand.
Asuna
340035_20_a
Or because you think it could
be possible for players to use it?
Kirito
340035_19_a
Why did you say that?
Because you think Klein wants
to use it himself?
Kirito
340035_18_a
Huh?
I...
I hope not...
Asuna
340035_17_a
Klein can't be thinking that
players would be able to use
that ability... Can he?
Kirito
340035_16_a
What is it, Kirito?
Asuna
340035_15_a
Wait...
Kirito
340035_14_a
Some of the vampire's minions in
this quest are people who've had
their blood sucked like that.
Kirito
340035_13_a
It's called Bloodbond. It lets you
control people if you bite them
and drink their blood.
Kirito
340035_12_a
What kind of ability does it have
when it's equipped to the vampire?
Asuna
340035_11_a
So I'd understand if he wanted
the current ability, but...
Kirito
340035_10_a
its ability is changed a little
bit, right?
Kirito
340035_9_a
When a player gets an item that
an enemy had equipped before,
Kirito
340035_8_a
Maybe...
Kirito
340035_7_a
Klein doesn't seem like the kind
of guy to fixate on items...
Could it be he wants its ability?
Asuna
340035_6_a
Every time I ask him, he just
dodges the question.
Kirito
340035_5_a
He says it's because he wants
the Dracula item, but he won't say
why that item's so important.
Kirito
340035_4_a
Well, he's been working on this
Halloween quest to take down
a vampire for a while...
Kirito
340035_3_a
Kirito
340035_2_a
bg_21_alne
What do you mean,
"Klein's acting weird"?
Asuna
340035_1_a
I wish it wasn't like this, but
I guess we don't have a choice...
Kirito
340033_16_a
Right...
So we're fighting a young girl
being controlled by the vampire...
Kirito
340033_15_a
Look, we got another fight on
our hands! Come on!
Klein
340033_14_a
B-Because... Because who cares!
Just help me out, man!
Klein
340033_13_a
you'd never be able to get
everything. So why is this item
in particular a must-have?
Kirito
340033_12_a
We do? I guess... But there's
so much in ALO to collect,
Kirito
340033_11_a
Look, serious gamers collect rare
items! It's what we do!
Klein
340033_10_a
W-Well, you know!
Klein
340033_9_a
What's with you? You're never
this tongue-tied.
Kirito
340033_8_a
Um, well, no, not...
I mean, y'see...
Klein
340033_7_a
But why do you want it, anyway?
Cosplay or something?
Kirito
340033_6_a
Yep!
Klein
340033_5_a
That's what you're after, right?
Kirito
340033_4_a
Dude, if we beat that, we'll get
the Dracula outfit!
Klein
340033_3_a
Klein
340033_2_a
bg_event_halloween_castle
The Halloween vampire mob is
around here somewhere...
Kirito
340033_1_a
Sounds good.
Kirito
340031_15_a
I knew my best bud wouldn't let me
down! Okay, I'll get more info
on the quest and get back to you.
Klein
340031_14_a
Sure, why not.
Kirito
340031_13_a
So there's this quest that gives
out the item I want as a reward.
You in?
Klein
340031_12_a
That's not really part of it-
Kirito
340031_11_a
Yeah, otherwise it'd mess up your
Black Swordsman look.
Klein
340031_10_a
And nothing too...out there.
You know?
Kirito
340031_9_a
Well, yeah, as long as it's
something with really
awesome stats.
Kirito
340031_8_a
Makes you wanna get one of
your own, am I right?
Klein
340031_7_a
It being Halloween and all, there
are lots of costumes-uh,
equipment coming out too!
Kirito
340031_6_a
Sure.
Kirito
340031_5_a
So there's all these subquests
coming out for Halloween, right?
Klein
340031_4_a
Hey, what's up?
Kirito
340031_3_a
Kirito
340031_2_a
bg_19_legrue_bridge
Yo, K-dawg!
Klein
340031_1_a
You got it!
Kirito
340028_19_a
Hehehe... Well! I'll be right here
when you do, so let me know!
Asuna
340028_18_a
I...don't know. But I think that
one day, I'll figure it out...
Kirito
340028_17_a
And what would that be?
Asuna
340028_16_a
But I get the feeling he gave me
something else too...
Kirito
340028_15_a
Kayaba... He chose to entrust
the Seed to me...
Kirito
340028_14_a
Asuna...
Kirito
340028_13_a
And for once, I think Klein's
right.
Asuna
340028_12_a
But Klein said it's more than
just skill or speed...
Kirito
340028_11_a
If I remember right, he said that
only the player with the best
reactions in SAO got it...
Asuna
340028_10_a
Didn't the commander say something
about that?
Asuna
340028_9_a
He said the reason I ended up with
Dual Blades wasn't just because
I was good. There was more to it.
Kirito
340028_8_a
It's just...I was just thinking
about what Klein said.
Kirito
340028_7_a
Kirito... Earth to Kirito!
Everything all right?
Asuna
340028_6_a
Yeah...
Kirito
340028_5_a
From what he told me, it sounds
like it's no easy feat to learn.
Asuna
340028_4_a
Yeah...
Kirito
340028_3_a
Kirito
340028_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
So Klein gave up on Skill Connect?
Asuna
340028_1_a
See you around.
Kirito
340027_26_a
Thanks for making time for me.
Talk to you later.
Klein
340027_25_a
Klein... Good luck.
Kirito
340027_24_a
Besides, I'll never beat you if
all I do is copy you, right?
Klein
340027_23_a
But I'm not gonna give up.
I'll find my own path, a skill
just as good, but all my own.
Klein
340027_22_a
Anyway, I know when to throw in
the towel. This Skill Connect's
not for me.
Klein
340027_21_a
Klein...
Kirito
340027_20_a
I don't think it's just because
you're good at games.
There's more to it than that.
Klein
340027_19_a
I finally get why it was you who
ended up with the Dual Blades
skill...
Klein
340027_18_a
K-dawg... No, Lord Kiribro...
I've gotta say...
You are a gaming GOD.
Klein
340027_17_a
Not impossible...
But yeah. Really, really hard...
Kirito
340027_16_a
Miss by a fraction of an inch or
a second and it fizzles. No matter
how you shake it, it's impossible!
Klein
340027_15_a
Your off-hand has to make the
exact right motion at the exact
right time to trigger the skill...
Klein
340027_14_a
Yeah...
So to do a Skill Connect...
Klein
340027_13_a
You...have? About training, right?
Kirito
340027_12_a
So I've been thinking...
Klein
340027_11_a
...
Klein
340027_10_a
But if it's too tricky for you,
why not switch back to just
one and give that a try?
Kirito
340027_9_a
It's easier for me to teach you if
you're using two weapons...
Kirito
340027_8_a
How do you keep track of what both
your hands are doing?!
Klein
340027_7_a
Seriously though, I never realized
wielding two weapons was this
hard...
Klein
340027_6_a
Hey, it's not my fault you're
out of shape.
Kirito
340027_5_a
Hey, lay off! I didn't expect to
be training for the Olympics here!
Your training's ridiculous!
Klein
340027_4_a
Klein... I've never seen someone
that out of breath in a VRMMO
before...
Kirito
340027_3_a
Kirito
340027_2_a
bg_18_mountain
gasp
wheeze
Klein
340027_1_a
Sure.
Watch closely...
Kirito
340025_22_a
Hmm, interesting idea...
Hey, can I see it again?
Klein
340025_21_a
But a skilled player might be able
to figure out a way to do it with
a two-handed weapon.
Kirito
340025_20_a
Triggering the sword skill I want
to combo into with my off-hand
felt like the easiest option...
Kirito
340025_19_a
Theoretically, anyway...
But remember, this isn't really a
skill. It's a system exploit.
Kirito
340025_18_a
Sharp as ever, Klein.
That's right.
Kirito
340025_17_a
Hmmm... Wait a sec... Doesn't that
mean you can only use Skill
Connect when using Dual Blades?
Klein
340025_16_a
I simplified a bit, but that's the
theory behind the Skill Connect.
Kirito
340025_15_a
However, triggering another sword
skill overrides this delay,
letting you combo multiple skills.
Kirito
340025_14_a
After every sword skill, there's
a short period of time that you
can't act: a recovery delay.
Kirito
340025_13_a
No prob.
Klein
340025_12_a
Okay. Before we get down to the
nitty-gritty, I need to make sure
you understand the theory.
Kirito
340025_11_a
I love how you're so mercilessly
straight to the point! So! Let the
lesson begin, teach!
Klein
340025_10_a
Not really. Asuna told me you
wanted me to teach you.
Kirito
340025_9_a
Aww, you can read me like a book!
Then again, we have been through
so much together! We're besties!
Klein
340025_8_a
You want me to teach you how to
do a Skill Connect, right?
Kirito
340025_7_a
Sooo, I've got a bit of a favor to
ask from the world's coolest dude.
Klein
340025_6_a
Also, could you please remove
the arm? I don't need a Klein
hug today.
Kirito
340025_5_a
Um...yes? You're certainly burning
with excitement today...
Kirito
340025_4_a
Heeey, so we're best buds, right?!
RIGHT?!
Klein
340025_3_a
AH! K-Klein? What's goi-
Kirito
340025_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Whoa-ho! Hey there, Kirito,
ol' buddy ol' pal!
Klein
340025_1_a
Fine, I'll teach him the theory.
But I doubt that he'll actually
listen to me...
Kirito
340023_25_a
Oh stop. Be nice to the poor boy
and show him your moves.
Asuna
340023_24_a
Oh no, not again...
Ugh, that guy can be a real pain
in the...
Kirito
340023_23_a
Hehehe... Klein was shouting about
how he'd force you to teach him
"those ridic sword hacks!!"
Asuna
340023_22_a
Thanks. Still, it was no easy feat
to link them up like that...
Kirito
340023_21_a
then used Skill Connect to combo
them into a magic-supplemented
ALO sword skill. That's smart!
Asuna
340023_20_a
Ahh, I get it!
You made basic attacks that
mimicked Dual Blades skills,
Asuna
340023_19_a
Yup, no magic at all.
That's probably why my attacks
fared so poorly in ALO at first.
Kirito
340023_18_a
They only dealt physical damage?
Asuna
340023_17_a
In other words, I wasn't using
skills or magic at all. I just
made a bunch of regular attacks.
Kirito
340023_16_a
But in the end, I was just
swinging my swords around to
simulate the movements.
Kirito
340023_15_a
I managed to succeed to some
extent...
Kirito
340023_14_a
Totally.
I worked hard to recreate the
skills I used in SAO in ALO.
Kirito
340023_13_a
You mean Dual Blades skills
like Double Circular were hard
to use?
Asuna
340023_12_a
I needed it if I wanted to keep up
with all of you out there.
Kirito
340023_11_a
But I only came up with Skill
Connect because using Dual Blades
in ALO was just so...ineffective...
Kirito
340023_10_a
Hmm... Maybe...
Kirito
340023_9_a
Maybe your reasons for coming up
with it were similar to Kayaba's
reasons for making unique skills?
Asuna
340023_8_a
Remember when we went to
Jotunheimr? You showed me a new
technique: Skill Connect.
Asuna
340023_7_a
But I still don't have an answer,
no matter how much I think
about it.
Kirito
340023_6_a
She said that when you use
Dual Blades, you wonder why
Heathcliff-Kayaba-put it in SAO.
Asuna
340023_5_a
Huh? Oh, yeah. I did. Why?
Kirito
340023_4_a
The other day, you had a long talk
with Yui about unique skills,
right?
Asuna
340023_3_a
Asuna! What's up?
Kirito
340023_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Kirito.
Asuna
340023_1_a
Daddy...
Yui
340021_27_a
But I can't shake the feeling that
there's something more to it...
Kirito
340021_26_a
There's no doubt that was at
least part of it...
Kirito
340021_25_a
I thought about that.
From what we know of Kayaba,
Kirito
340021_24_a
By creating powers that rivaled
his own, he hoped to grant SAO's
players a modicum of hope.
Yui
340021_23_a
I have a bit of a theory...
Kayaba's purpose in adding unique
skills was to inspire the players.
Yui
340021_22_a
But the only ones publicly known
were my Dual Blades and
Heathcliff's Divine Blade.
Kirito
340021_21_a
Yeah, there were about ten in all.
At least, so I heard.
Kirito
340021_20_a
But it wasn't the only unique
skill in SAO, right?
Yui
340021_19_a
Why did Heathcliff-Why did Kayaba
add it to SAO?
I just don't understand...
Kirito
340021_18_a
I keep thinking that I'm letting
myself be defined by my unique
skill. By Dual Blades.
Kirito
340021_17_a
What do you mean?
Yui
340021_16_a
I'm happy I figured out how to do
it, but...honestly, using Dual
Blades feels weird...
Kirito
340021_15_a
...Is something the matter?
Yui
340021_14_a
Yeah. It took me hours and hours
of practice to get it right...
Kirito
340021_13_a
That was...completely unassisted?
Yui
340021_12_a
but I didn't use the system's
help at all for it.
Kirito
340021_11_a
It is. That's why I said it was
"similar." I equipped two swords
and mimicked it,
Kirito
340021_10_a
So it should be impossible to use
that technique here...
Yui
340021_9_a
But you can't use Dual Blades like that in
ALO, and there's no such thing as
unique skills here either.
Yui
340021_8_a
I suppose it would have to be.
That was a sword skill in SAO's
unique skill tree for Dual Blades.
Yui
340021_7_a
Well, not quite. It's similar,
but fundamentally different.
Kirito
340021_6_a
You guessed it.
Double Circular...
Kirito
340021_5_a
Daddy... Was that...?
Yui
340021_4_a
bg_18_mountain
Phew...
Kirito
340021_3_a
bg_black
Kirito
340021_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Rrrrr.....
HRRRAAAAHH!!
Kirito
340021_1_a
Don't let me down!
Asuna
340018_18_a
O-Okay then!
You're on!
Kirito
340018_17_a
Say what?!
Kirito
340018_16_a
Hehe, hook a big one and
maybe I'll let YOU off the hook!
Asuna
340018_15_a
I haven't been fishing THAT much!
Let me have this one thing!
Kirito
340018_14_a
After all, I can't let myself be
stolen away by a hobby, like a
certain newlywed I know!
Asuna
340018_13_a
I-I just want to try it out!
Asuna
340018_12_a
Ooh, have you caught
the fishing bug too?
Kirito
340018_11_a
Are you finally going to
teach me how to fish?
Asuna
340018_10_a
Ready to go?
Nishida's probably waiting for us.
Kirito
340018_9_a
Kirito... That's so sweet.
Asuna
340018_8_a
Right now I just want
to focus on enjoying
our life together.
Kirito
340018_7_a
It's not like I'm actually
getting rusty or anything.
Kirito
340018_6_a
Hm?
Oh, uh...yeah, sure.
Kirito
340018_5_a
Are you sure you've
practiced enough?
Asuna
340018_4_a
Sure thing.
Kirito
340018_3_a
I'll come with you!
Just give me a minute to
pack some lunches for us.
Asuna
340018_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Maybe I'll go fishing
again today!
Kirito
340018_1_a
Yeah.
Asuna
340017_31_a
Well, I guess we should
head back soon.
Kirito
340017_30_a
I see.
Asuna
340017_29_a
So I feel like there
has to be a way.
Kirito
340017_28_a
That would pretty much be
the embodiment of a VRMMO's
limitless possibilities.
Kirito
340017_27_a
I've heard it's possible, but
it takes time. You can't make
a new skill overnight.
Kirito
340017_26_a
Are you serious?
Asuna
340017_25_a
Players can make their own
skills by sort of exploiting the
system.
Kirito
340017_24_a
What do you mean?
Asuna
340017_23_a
True. More to the point, you're
talking about skills from
outside the system, right?
Kirito
340017_22_a
How could you possibly
get any more powerful?
Asuna
340017_21_a
You got an extra skill by
virtue of being one of the
strongest players in SAO, right?
Asuna
340017_20_a
But listen, Kirito...
Asuna
340017_19_a
I can't get complacent.
Kirito
340017_18_a
Yeah, but it wasn't enough to
give me the edge over Heathcliff.
Kirito
340017_17_a
Well, that's good.
Asuna
340017_16_a
The System Assist feature takes
over for me once I activate
the skill. It's pretty automatic.
Kirito
340017_15_a
I guess that's the SAO
skill system for you.
Kirito
340017_14_a
Honestly, everything's perfect.
Kirito
340017_13_a
Oh, well...
Kirito
340017_12_a
So, how's your practice going?
Asuna
340017_11_a
Oh yeah, I guess it is almost
morning already.
Kirito
340017_10_a
Besides, I figured I'd come
out for a little walk.
Asuna
340017_9_a
But you were gone so long!
Asuna
340017_8_a
Huh? What's wrong, Asuna?
I said you could sleep in!
Kirito
340017_7_a
Hey, Kiritoooo!
Asuna
340017_6_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Phew.
Yeah, that's about how it goes.
Kirito
340017_5_a
bg_black
Kirito
340017_4_a
bg_11_forest_yui
HAAAH!
Kirito
340017_3_a
bg_black
Kirito
340017_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Hmph!
Kirito
340017_1_a
Okay! See you.
Asuna
340015_28_a
Nothing, I'm fine.
In fact, I'm gonna take you up on
your suggestion. Be right back!
Kirito
340015_27_a
What's wrong?
Asuna
340015_26_a
Like kendo...
Kirito
340015_25_a
Hehe, well, why don't you put in
some practice if you're worried?
Treat it like kendo training.
Asuna
340015_24_a
My biggest concern would be
whether or not I'd be able
to use it when the time came.
Kirito
340015_23_a
I've been hiding that skill
for so long. I've hardly used it.
Kirito
340015_22_a
Huh?
Asuna
340015_21_a
Yeah, that's the problem.
Kirito
340015_20_a
Yeah, even your Dual Blades
extra skill wouldn't even be
much of an advantage, would it?
Asuna
340015_19_a
I've still got a ways to go.
Otherwise I wouldn't have lost
to Heathcliff.
Kirito
340015_18_a
I guess even powerful
players like you have their own
fears and worries too.
Asuna
340015_17_a
It's okay.
I'm glad you told me.
Asuna
340015_16_a
Sorry, I shouldn't say things
like that. We've got it good.
Kirito
340015_15_a
Aww, Kirito...
Asuna
340015_14_a
So I can't shake the feeling that
my sword skills are going to get
rusty, living like this.
Kirito
340015_13_a
Like, SAO has a level system,
but a FullDive VRMMO like this
requires instincts.
Kirito
340015_12_a
What's that supposed to mean?
Asuna
340015_11_a
It's just...swordsman problems.
Kirito
340015_10_a
But this isn't worth
losing sleep over.
Kirito
340015_9_a
I know that.
Kirito
340015_8_a
Hehe, you've got that right!
So, what's on your mind?
You can talk to me.
Asuna
340015_7_a
Heh, you can read me like a book.
I shouldn't expect anything
less from my wife, though.
Kirito
340015_6_a
I do?
Kirito
340015_5_a
Nope.
You look pretty deep
in thought.
Asuna
340015_4_a
Asuna?
You're not asleep yet?
Kirito
340015_3_a
Kirito
340015_2_a
bg_11_home_bedroom_night
Is that you, Kirito?
Asuna
340015_1_a
Sure thing.
See you.
Kirito
340013_16_a
Right then, Kirito,
I'll see you tomorrow!
Take care.
Nishida
340013_15_a
Oh, ha ha.
Yeah, that it does!
Kirito
340013_14_a
Eh, I can't stop you worrying,
really, but the beauty of fishing
is that it calms your soul.
Nishida
340013_13_a
So in order to take
your mind off all that-
Nishida
340013_12_a
Um...
Kirito
340013_11_a
Hm. Well, I'm sure
she has her reasons.
Nishida
340013_10_a
I, uh...
I shouldn't have said anything...
Kirito
340013_9_a
Hm? Wait, she fights?
Nishida
340013_8_a
She must be curious about how
many floors have been cleared
so far...
Kirito
340013_7_a
She said she had something to
look into at home today.
Kirito
340013_6_a
No problem at all!
I just like the company.
Speaking of, where's your wife?
Nishida
340013_5_a
You're not kidding.
Thanks for all the help!
Kirito
340013_4_a
We sure had a good haul!
Nishida
340013_3_a
Nishida
340013_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
Whoa! Look at all those fish!
Kirito
340013_1_a
Okay! Have fun.
Asuna
340011_21_a
Hmm. If you say so.
Anyway, I'm gonna go now...
Kirito
340011_20_a
Hehe, you're so easy to rile up.
Asuna
340011_19_a
Say what?!
Why would I ever do that?!
Kirito
340011_18_a
Oh yeah. Well, in that case,
I guess spying on you to make
sure you don't cheat on me can wait...
Asuna
340011_17_a
You what? Didn't you say you
were going to get some intel
from the front lines today?
Kirito
340011_16_a
That's okay! I'll come too!
Asuna
340011_15_a
Heh, yeah.
Look, I'm sorry about...
Kirito
340011_14_a
And that's how they reel you in.
Asuna
340011_13_a
It's just so pleasant in games.
You just catch fish. No fighting,
no mess. Unlike real life.
Kirito
340011_12_a
Uh, yeah. That too...
Kirito
340011_11_a
I guess there were a lot of
fishing games back in the day.
I didn't play them, though.
Asuna
340011_10_a
And I was just thinking 'Man,
I love the way Asuna cooks fish.
I should go get some!'
Kirito
340011_9_a
H-Hey, whoa, it's not like that!
I mean, I enjoy it, but it's...
Look, it helps us both, right?
Kirito
340011_8_a
Tsk tsk tsk!
Just married, and you're already
picking your hobbies over me!
Asuna
340011_7_a
Wha-! Uh, well, I mean...
Okay, you've got me there.
Kirito
340011_6_a
Come on, admit it.
You're starting to like
this fishing thing!
Asuna
340011_5_a
Yeah, to get tonight's dinner.
Kirito
340011_4_a
Going to Nishida's place again?
Asuna
340011_3_a
Asuna
340011_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Okay, Asuna, I'm headed
out for a bit.
Kirito
340011_1_a
Yeah, you're right! Let's go!
Silica
250168_16_a
They might be holding some sort of
New Year's event!
Yuuki
250168_15_a
Yep. C'mon, let's check out this
temple now that we've made it
all the way up here!
Yuuki
250168_14_a
There he goes...
Silica
250168_13_a
I have kept my promise, and so
I bid you farewell.
Tengu
250168_12_a
I'm glad we made it in one piece.
Yuuki
250168_11_a
Oh, you're more than welcome!
Silica
250168_10_a
Thank you both ever so much.
Nun
250168_9_a
Pina
250168_8_a
Yuuki
250168_7_a
Silica
250168_6_a
bg_02_forest
At last, we've made it. And thanks
to the wings of a Tengu, no less!
That was most unexpected.
Nun
250168_5_a
Indeed. And I have no choice but
to help you. Take me to the nun.
Tengu
250168_4_a
Woohoo! Was that the sound of you
admitting defeat?
Yuuki
250168_3_a
Yuuki
250168_2_a
bg_08_forest
Urgh... You were impeccable!
Tengu
250168_1_a
Very well! Prepare to face my
supernatural powers!
Tengu
250167_21_a
Okay, Tengu! You're on!
Yuuki
250167_20_a
Yup! He's a Tengu of his word.
Yuuki
250167_19_a
But he'll help us if we beat him,
right?
Silica
250167_18_a
Oh...right. This big guy never met
a contest he didn't like.
Yuuki
250167_17_a
I only lend favors to those who
best me in battle!
Tengu
250167_16_a
Surely you have not forgotten
that I am a Tengu!
Tengu
250167_15_a
So... You'll do it?
Yuuki
250167_14_a
Hmph. A most simple request.
Tengu
250167_13_a
So you're ordering me to take
her to the summit, are you?
Tengu
250167_12_a
Do you think you could help us
get her to the summit?
Yuuki
250167_11_a
A nun nearby is struggling to
get up the mountain path.
Yuuki
250167_10_a
What do you want with me?
Tengu
250167_9_a
Gosh, his nose is really long!
And he's got wings! He looks
like a fairy from ALO!
Silica
250167_8_a
Tengu, I know!
Yuuki
250167_7_a
Yuuki, he's a...
Silica
250167_6_a
Whoa, you remember me?
Awesome!
Yuuki
250167_5_a
Silica
250167_4_a
Pina
250167_3_a
Yuuki
250167_2_a
bg_08_forest
So, you have returned...
???
250167_1_a
Hehe, I'd rather not spoil
the surprise!
Yuuki
250165_23_a
Who's that?
Silica
250165_22_a
Or does it?! I think I know just
the guy for the job, and he
lives around here!
Yuuki
250165_21_a
Well, we'd need a monster we can
reason with... That limits things.
Yuuki
250165_20_a
Exactly!
Silica
250165_19_a
What, like a monster or something?
Yuuki
250165_18_a
What if we got something that can
fly and attached it to her? Or had
it pick her up?
Silica
250165_17_a
Although...
Silica
250165_16_a
Hah! Right.
I can't believe I forgot that.
Yuuki
250165_15_a
We can't interact with her
directly, though, remember?
Silica
250165_14_a
If only this were ALO. I'd just
grab her and fly to the top.
Yuuki
250165_13_a
Yeah, you're probably right...
Silica
250165_12_a
Even if we could, the path ahead
is steep and muddy. We'd get stuck
for sure.
Yuuki
250165_11_a
Yes! Oxcarts! We should be able
to borrow one from somewhere!
Silica
250165_10_a
Here in Asuka Empire? I mean,
I guess there are oxcarts...
Yuuki
250165_9_a
Is there something she can ride?
Silica
250165_8_a
There's no way she can keep up
with us. There's got to be another
way.
Yuuki
250165_7_a
W-We've barely left the spot where
we found her!
Silica
250165_6_a
Are you kidding me?!
Yuuki

Silica
250165_4_a

bg_02_forest
huff
huff
I-I can't go...any
further... Let me rest a spell.
Nun
250165_1_a
Here's hoping.
Yuuki
250163_21_a
She may look old, but she might
have a spring in her step!
Silica
250163_20_a
Well, we should at least try and
walk with her for a little while.
Silica
250163_19_a
I can't just toss her on my
back and hop up the mountain.
Yuuki
250163_18_a
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
Our interactions with NPCs are
restricted.
Yuuki
250163_17_a
And we can take her hand when
she needs to... Oh, wait.
Silica
250163_16_a
Yeah, but...
Yuuki
250163_15_a
D-Does it matter? We can take our
time, can't we?
Silica
250163_14_a
What if she can't keep up with us?
Yuuki
250163_13_a
Maybe she needs to take it slow?
Yuuki
250163_12_a
Why do you say that?
Silica
250163_11_a
But I'm afraid taking me along
might cause you more trouble
than it's worth.
Nun
250163_10_a
Join you? Why, I'd love to...
Nun
250163_9_a
Would you like to join us?
Silica
250163_8_a
That's where we're headed too!
Yuuki
250163_7_a
Oh, I was just taking a rest, my
dear. I'm planning to greet the
new year at the temple ahead.
Nun
250163_6_a
So, um... What brings you up here?
Silica
250163_5_a
Silica
250163_4_a
Pina
250163_3_a
Yuuki
250163_2_a
bg_02_forest
Well, well, I never thought I'd
see another soul up here.
What an auspicious meeting!
Nun
250163_1_a
Sure, why not?
Yuuki
250161_17_a
I-I can see that, but what's she
doing all the way up here?
Should we ask?
Silica
250161_16_a
Hm? Oh, she looks like a nun.
I'll bet she's an NPC.
Yuuki
250161_15_a
No, it doesn't...
Wait, who's that?
Silica
250161_14_a
It doesn't help that our
converted avatars have
such weak stats.
Yuuki
250161_13_a
And it only gets worse from here.
We'll have to take a lot of
breaks.
Yuuki
250161_12_a
W-Wow... You weren't kidding about
the steepness...
Silica
250161_11_a
Then let's get stepping!
Yuuki
250161_10_a
That's okay! I'll give it a shot!
Silica
250161_9_a
Of course! The mountain path
is pretty steep, though. It'll
take a while.
Yuuki
250161_8_a
Oh, really! Can we take a little
walk to check it out?
Silica
250161_7_a
I'm pretty sure there's a famous
temple at the summit.
Yuuki
250161_6_a
I think I stopped here once back
when I used to play this game.
Yuuki
250161_5_a
Have you been here before?
Silica
250161_4_a
Pina
250161_3_a
Silica
250161_2_a
bg_02_forest
Wait a second.
This looks familiar...
Yuuki
250161_1_a
Ahaha! I'll tell you all about it
while we're making chocolate!
Yuuki
250138_16_a
Just what were you doing out there
all this time?!
Asuna
250138_15_a
You "fought the ground"?
Asuna
250138_14_a
Ah, actually... I didn't play with
plants much today. I kinda just
fought the ground for a while.
Yuuki
250138_13_a
That's a surprise. I know Tecchi
loves gardening, but I didn't know
you had the soul of a farmer.
Asuna
250138_12_a
Well, yeah! I do! I actually did
it a lot in real life.
Yuuki
250138_11_a
Fun? Really? I never took you for
someone with a green thumb.
You like growing plants?
Asuna
250138_10_a
Nah, it was a piece of cake!
Actually, I had a ton of fun!
Yuuki
250138_9_a
Yup! So anyway, was it hard
gathering everything?
Asuna
250138_8_a
We just have to make it like we
made the trial chocolate, right?
Yuuki
250138_7_a
Hehe, good to hear! I've managed
to get all the tools we'll need
together on my end.
Asuna
250138_6_a
We should have enough to make
chocolate for Kirito, Tecchi, and
everyone else!
Yuuki
250138_5_a
Ta-dah! I got all the stuff we
needed!
Yuuki
250138_4_a
Welcome back, Yuuki!
How'd it go?
Asuna
250138_3_a
Asuna
250138_2_a
bg_03_pub
I'm baaack!
Yuuki
250138_1_a
Yup. The rest should be easy,
now that we've got the land
fixed up for it.
Rechka
250137_23_a
All that's left to do now is get
some water, plant some seeds, use
those speed-up items, and done!
Yuuki
250137_22_a
Those ground-pounding combos were
crazy. You were a human tractor
out there.
Rechka
250137_21_a
Ahaha! But that just makes what
you accomplished even more
impressive.
Rechka
250137_20_a
Basically, I was just playing in
the mud, ha ha ha!
Yuuki
250137_19_a
I was just having fun smashing the
ground with my sword and pouring
fertilizer in there!
Yuuki
250137_18_a
Ha ha, you're welcome!
But I didn't really do anything.
Yuuki
250137_17_a
Nice work, Yuuki. Thanks to you,
everyone agreed to stop fighting
and work together.
Rechka
250137_16_a
Rechka
250137_15_a
Phew... I think we're done!
Yuuki
250137_14_a
Yeah! Let's do this!
Players
250137_13_a
So, if you want more cacao beans
for Salamander Fire Chocolate, get
over here and lend a hand!
Rechka
250137_12_a
We're making a new cacao field!
With Yuuki taking the lead and all
of your help, it'll be a snap!
Rechka
250137_11_a
Over here, everyone!
Gather 'round!
Rechka
250137_10_a
Ha ha, wow! I am impressed. Yuuki
there's a match for Asuna when it
comes to getting people motivated.
Rechka
250137_9_a
It might make this tedious cacao
farming a whole lot easier! That
girl's a genius! Hey! Let's help!
Female Player A
250137_8_a
Ohh, that would make sense...
Hmm, if we all used items on the
cacao trees to help them grow...
Female Player A
250137_7_a
Hey... You don't think she's
trying to make a new cacao
plantation, do you?
Female Player B
250137_6_a
Yeah, but look at that power!
She's ripping the ground up like
a miniature bulldozer!
Female Player A
250137_5_a
She's using sword skills on the
ground? Weird.
Female Player B
250137_4_a
What's up with that girl?
Female Player A
250137_3_a
Wow...
Rechka
250137_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
Hrrraaaaghhh!!
Yuuki
250137_1_a
Hold up... What are you planning,
Yuuki?
Rechka
250135_16_a
Maybe! We'll just have to convince
them that it's a good idea!
Yuuki
250135_15_a
Ha ha ha! You're a positive one,
aren't you, Yuuki? The problem is,
are those girls willing to help?
Rechka
250135_14_a
Hehe, I've got an idea. There are
a lot of bored gals around here
waiting for beans to spawn, right?
Yuuki
250135_13_a
Farming's a tough job in real life
and here. We need a ton of players
with high strength to make one.
Rechka
250135_12_a
Well, we'd love to, but it takes
a lot of people and a lot of work
to make a field.
Rechka
250135_11_a
That makes sense... Hey, question!
There's tons of land around here.
Why not just make more farms?
Yuuki
250135_10_a
In other words, people are gonna
get angry and pick fights.
Rechka
250135_9_a
Basically, yeah. But this is a
VRMMO, so everyone's battling
over limited resources.
Rechka
250135_8_a
Rechka
250135_7_a
Ahh, so that's what you're doing
here. Keeping the peace!
Yuuki
250135_6_a
I'm not disagreeing with you
there.
Rechka
250135_5_a
What's up with this event, anyway?
There are almost no gathering
points, and they refresh SO slow!
Female Player B
250135_4_a
But...!
Female Player A
250135_3_a
Everyone wants these beans, and
there's only so many to go around.
Get in line, and wait your turn.
Rechka
250135_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
Hey! You there! Cool your heads,
or I'll cool them for you. You're
bothering the other players.
Rechka
250135_1_a
Security?
Yuuki
250133_19_a
I'm here as Salamander security
to make sure players don't get too
rowdy on our land.
Rechka
250133_18_a
Nah. I'm not after it myself.
Rechka
250133_17_a
Are you here to battle these girls
over the cacao harvest too?
Yuuki
250133_16_a
"Salamander Fire Chocolate"?
Ha ha, cute name. Appropriate,
though.
Rechka
250133_15_a
Yup! Asuna and I are working
together to mass produce
Salamander Fire Chocolate!
Yuuki
250133_14_a
Ohh, you must've come to gather
cacao beans for that special
Salamander chocolate too, huh?
Rechka
250133_13_a
Rechka
250133_12_a
Rechka? Oh, hi!
Yuuki
250133_11_a
Hey, Yuuki! I didn't know you
were here too.
???
250133_10_a
Yowch, these girls are mean...
Yuuki
250133_9_a
Shut up and go away! This doesn't
concern you, so butt out!
Female Player A
250133_8_a
Hey, what's the problem here?
Yuuki
250133_7_a
So that how it's going to be?
Fine! Let's duel!
Female Player B
250133_6_a
These beans are precious! I'm not
letting them go without a fight!
Female Player A
250133_5_a
That sounds like a fight...
Yuuki
250133_4_a
Oh, stop whining! I got here
first, so they're mine!
???
250133_3_a
Hey, what do you think you're
doing?! Those are MY beans!
???
250133_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
Let's see... There's supposed to
be a cacao plantation around here
somewhere...
Yuuki
250133_1_a
Hehe, alright!
This'll be a breeze!
Yuuki
250131_17_a
Got it!
Thanks, Yuuki!
Asuna
250131_16_a
Great! Then I'll go out and buy
and grow what we'll need!
Leave the farming to me!
Yuuki
250131_15_a
Well...alright. Besides, we do
need to split up if we ever want
to finish this.
Asuna
250131_14_a
Making Salamander Fire Chocolate
requires a lot of steps, so I'm
sure I'll be good at some of them!
Yuuki
250131_13_a
No, you and I both know it is.
But don't worry about me!
Yuuki
250131_12_a
Hey, that's not true at all!
Asuna
250131_11_a
Sounds perfect! I'll be honest,
I don't think I can help much with
the complicated cooking stuff.
Yuuki
250131_10_a
Sure! Can I ask you to gather
ingredients while I
prepare the tools?
Asuna
250131_9_a
Asuna
250131_8_a
Hey Asuna, is there anything I
can do?
Yuuki
250131_7_a
I bet there's some sort of
time-saving item that'll help
a lot, but where to find it...?
Asuna
250131_6_a
Ouch, that's going to be tough...
It'll take a while to make
everything too...
Asuna
250131_5_a
You'll have to provide both the
ingredients and the equipment
yourself from here on out.
Patissier NPC
250131_4_a
Sorry, no can do. We can only
let you use our equipment for
the trial batch.
Patissier NPC
250131_3_a
I'll need a lot of specialized
equipment too. May I use yours?
Asuna
250131_2_a
bg_03_pub
Hmm... To make chocolate liquor,
I'll need to ferment, dry, and
roast cocoa beans...
Asuna
250131_1_a
Hehe, thanks.
Sinon
250128_23_a
You mean Asuna, right? But I've
got another good friend who's a
great teacher too. You, Sinon!
Yuuki
250128_22_a
You do that. Remember, you have
a good friend whose specialty is
that sort of thing.
Sinon
250128_21_a
I'll work hard to be a better
teacher for my troops. Promise!
Yuuki
250128_20_a
I can't grow as a person if I
don't try my best at new things,
even if I'm not good at them.
Yuuki
250128_19_a
Hehe, sorry. But...yeah.
Yuuki
250128_18_a
That's not what I... NO!!
Sinon
250128_17_a
Ahaha, you were lonely, weren't
you?
Yuuki
250128_16_a
Hey, I was just bored. You guys
haven't chased me for a while
now.
Sinon
250128_15_a
I mean, I hear that joker is even
pretending to be someone else
to do theirs!
Yuuki
250128_14_a
Yeah... I need to try harder at
my job.
Yuuki
250128_13_a
Well, you're Card Captain Yuuki
now. You've got to learn how to
teach.
Sinon
250128_12_a
Well, you're right, and I know it.
Honestly, I'm not the best
teacher.
Yuuki
250128_11_a
I...was just passing by.
Sinon
250128_10_a
Ahh... You were watching the
whole time, huh?
Yuuki
250128_9_a
Not everyone can move or learn
as fast as you do.
Sinon
250128_8_a
I think you're expecting too much
of them. You need to slow down
and teach them bit by bit.
Sinon
250128_7_a
Ahaha, yeah... It was pretty
pathetic.
Yuuki
250128_6_a
It was just too painful to watch.
Sinon
250128_5_a
That was you who helped us back
there, wasn't it?
Yuuki
250128_4_a
Yeah?
Sinon
250128_3_a
Sinon!
Yuuki
250128_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
...
Sinon
250128_1_a
Y-Yes, Captain!
Players
250127_22_a
Now's our chance to form up!
One more time, just like we
practiced! Attaaack!!
Yuuki
250127_21_a
It's not important! Back on your
feet, quickly!
Yuuki
250127_20_a
...
Yuuki
250127_19_a
Where did that attack just come
from?!
Players
250127_18_a
Graaawr!!
Monster
250127_17_a
Huh?!
Yuuki
250127_16_a
Hold the liiine!!
Yuuki
250127_15_a
But it's scary!
Players
250127_14_a
I said, stay in formation!
Yuuki
250127_13_a
Yeep!!
Players
250127_12_a
GRAAAWR!!
Monster
250127_11_a
Yes, Captain!!
Players
250127_10_a
Second battalion, into the sky,
then drop on them from above!
Just like we practiced!
Yuuki
250127_9_a
Soldiers, stay in formation!
Surround the enemy!
Yuuki
250127_8_a
Kirito
250127_7_a
Yuuki!! Hold strong!!
Asuna
250127_6_a
They're cutting us off from Yuuki
and her troops!
Kirito
250127_5_a
Monsters here too?!
Asuna
250127_4_a
Kirito
250127_3_a
Asuna
250127_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Grawrrr!!
Monster
250127_1_a
Nah, they're in serious trouble.
Let's go lend a hand.
Kirito
250125_33_a
Kirito
250125_32_a
Think they'll be okay?
Asuna
250125_31_a
Yuuki
250125_30_a
Y-Yes, Captain!
Players
250125_29_a
Show me the power of the new
and elite Card Soldier Corps!
Yuuki
250125_28_a
Alright, people, on your feet!
Monster slaying time!
Yuuki
250125_27_a
Kirito
250125_26_a
Why are monsters spawning now?!
Asuna
250125_25_a
Ahh!
Yuuki
250125_24_a
Graaawr!!
Monster
250125_23_a
Yes...? Did I carry out my
duties well?
Players
250125_22_a
Fine, we're taking a break!
Yuuki
250125_21_a
Ugh! Come on!
You're all exhausted, already?!
Yuuki
250125_20_a
Asuna
250125_19_a
No, probably not... The Sleeping
Knights are all pretty elite,
especially compared to these guys.
Kirito
250125_18_a
I doubt regular players have the
skills to master her high-level
techniques...
Asuna
250125_17_a
Yeah... She's always been
surrounded by super-skilled
veteran players.
Asuna
250125_16_a
Asuna
250125_15_a
Wow... Yuuki's a really hardcore
drill sergeant. How many of these
guys can keep up?
Kirito
250125_14_a
Yuuki
250125_13_a
Y-Yes, Captain!
Players
250125_12_a
What'd I just tell you! Faster!
FAAASSSTEER!!
Yuuki
250125_11_a
They're all calling her "Card
Captain Yuuki" and happily
obeying her orders.
Asuna
250125_9_a
Kirito
250125_10_a
Yeah. Most of the players who got
card titles are being treated as
fresh recruits.
Asuna
250125_8_a
Asuna
250125_7_a
Looks like Yuuki's training a
bunch of players along with
her Card Soldiers, huh?
Kirito
250125_6_a
Yuuki
250125_5_a
Y-Yes, Captain!
Players
250125_4_a
No no no, you're doing it all
wrong! Stab faster! The enemy will
run circles around you like that!
Yuuki
250125_3_a
Yuuki
250125_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Hyah!
Hiiiya!
Players
250125_1_a
...
Sinon
250123_18_a
We'll chat another time!
Yuuki
250123_17_a
So, on that note, bye! See you
later, Sinon! I mean, Joker!
Yuuki
250123_16_a
I totally forgot I was supposed
to be training people to deal with
all these new monsters! Whoops!
Yuuki
250123_15_a
Oooh, that's a good point!
Also, uh oh!!
Yuuki
250123_14_a
N-No, that's not it at all! I'm
not doing my job as the joker
if people are ignoring me!
Sinon
250123_13_a
Hehe, you're sad if no one's
paying attention to you?
Yuuki
250123_12_a
Err... I'm...not sure how to feel
about that.
Sinon
250123_11_a
O-Oh, they have...?
Sinon
250123_10_a
Besides, a lot of people have
pretty much forgotten about you.
There's these new uber monsters...
Yuuki
250123_9_a
Ahh, so you mean normally I should
be trying to capture you? But
you're not doing anything bad.
Yuuki
250123_8_a
I'm the one causing trouble and
disturbing the peace.
Sinon
250123_7_a
It's your job to protect the
country and keep order. I'm
your opposite here.
Sinon
250123_6_a
Yeah! Card Captain Yuuki!
Cool, huh?
Yuuki
250123_5_a
As the ace of spades, you were
chosen as the new captain of the
Card Soldiers, right?
Sinon
250123_4_a
Sorry? For what?
Yuuki
250123_3_a
Yuuki
250123_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Sorry to do this to you, though.
Sinon
250123_1_a
Ahaha, yeah... I did, didn't I?
Yuuki
250121_19_a
I didn't exactly plan this, okay?
You zoomed and caught me like
a hyper bullet. I had no choice.
Sinon
250121_18_a
I thought for sure you'd pick
Kirito or Asuna to tell.
Yuuki
250121_17_a
I...guess? I also guess I'm the
lucky one who gets to know
who the joker really is!
Yuuki
250121_16_a
That should be obvious, right?
Sinon
250121_15_a
Secrets are harder to keep the
more people know them.
Sinon
250121_14_a
What's the difference between
one person knowing and two?
Yuuki
250121_13_a
Once two or more people knew,
I'd have to cast aside this cloak
and abandon the role.
Sinon
250121_12_a
He did say that as long as only
one person I trusted found out,
it'd be fine, but...
Sinon
250121_11_a
When he gave me this job, the
joker told me that if people found
out who I was, my job was over.
Sinon
250121_10_a
Huh? Why?
Yuuki
250121_9_a
Well, I considered telling them at
first... But it's too late.
Sinon
250121_8_a
Hey, Sinon? Can't I tell Kirito
and Asuna and everyone? Pleaaase?
I hate keeping secrets!
Yuuki
250121_7_a
Well, I'll forgive you this time.
I'm just glad no one else is
around.
Sinon
250121_6_a
Ehehe, sorry! It just slipped...
Yuuki
250121_5_a
If I want to play the joker and
sow chaos, I can't let people
know who I am!
Sinon
250121_4_a
Ugh, Yuuki! I thought I told
you to keep quiet!
Sinon
250121_3_a
...
Joker
250121_2_a
bg_event_wonderland
Ah, Sinoooo...
Ahem, I mean, Joker!
That's totally who you are!
Yuuki
250121_1_a
Yes, of course!
Suguha
250118_15_a
Ah, the next customer is here.
Shino
250118_14_a
Excuse me. I'd like to buy these.
Worshiper
250118_13_a
Then I guess I didn't need to
worry!
Shino
250118_12_a
I always try to keep things fun,
in both kendo and ALO! Otherwise
what's the point?
Suguha
250118_11_a
Ha ha, don't worry about that.
I won't get carried away.
Suguha
250118_10_a
Yeah, just...don't get too carried
away with the customer-as-opponent
thing.
Shino
250118_9_a
Either way, it seems like that was
definitely the right call!
Suguha
250118_8_a
Heh, yeah. Maybe it's the kendo
practice or fighting in ALO.
Suguha
250118_7_a
So I was right! Your natural
talents come out when it feels
more like a battle!
Shino
250118_6_a
I'm doing even better than I
thought I would!
Suguha
250118_5_a
All thanks to you! I'm just
following the advice you gave me.
Suguha
250118_4_a
There you go. You're getting
better at this, Suguha!
Shino
250118_3_a
Thank you for your patronage.
We humbly await your return.
Suguha
250118_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
Two charms and a votive picture.
That will be 2,500 yen.
Suguha
250118_1_a
Yeah, maybe...
Suguha
250117_19_a
I know you're fast, so this should
be second nature to you.
Shino
250117_18_a
Pretend you're trying to get the
jump on your opponent. Except your
opponent is the customer's needs.
Shino
250117_17_a
We're going to turn those nerves
into the excitement you feel
before a battle.
Shino
250117_16_a
Say what?
Suguha
250117_15_a
Okay then. New strategy.
Your customers are no longer
godlike. They're opponents.
Shino
250117_14_a
It was just me and a bunch of
my Sylph friends playing around.
Suguha
250117_13_a
W-Well, yeah... I'm too young for
a real job, and I've done stuff
like this in ALO, but...
Suguha
250117_12_a
This is the first job you've
ever had, isn't it?
Shino
250117_11_a
Unless what, Shino?
Suguha
250117_10_a
Unless...
Shino
250117_9_a
Though, top Sylph warrior or not,
I guess you're still in middle
school. This should be easy.
Shino
250117_8_a
E-Exactly...!
Suguha
250117_7_a
So when your customer is, in a
sense, a literal deity, of course
you're going to be nervous!
Shino
250117_6_a
And now there's the added pressure
of them telling us not to be shy
because we serve a higher power.
Shino
250117_5_a
What's the philosophy in almost
any job? The customer is always
right.
Shino
250117_4_a
It might actually be a good sign.
Think about it.
Shino
250117_3_a
Shino
250117_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
I've never been so nervous in
front of people before. Why now?
Suguha
250117_1_a
...
Shino
250115_21_a
but when I'm actually standing in
front of a customer, I panic.
Suguha
250115_20_a
In my head, I know exactly what
I'm doing and how to do it,
Suguha
250115_19_a
Hah! You haven't been around me
enough. Honestly, I don't know
what it is...
Suguha
250115_18_a
Where's all this coming from?
You're usually so confident.
Shino
250115_17_a
Yeah, I hope so...
Suguha
250115_16_a
Just keep at it. It'll get easier.
Shino
250115_15_a
You really should be more careful.
Though I guess working the
register takes getting used to.
Shino
250115_14_a
Ooh, hot cocoa? Yes, please!
sip
Yeow, that's hot!
Suguha
250115_13_a
Here, have a sip of this.
It'll get you warmed up.
Shino
250115_12_a
Ha ha, yeah, these winter nights
get pretty cold.
Suguha
250115_11_a
Yeah. That was quite the sigh you
let out. I could see your breath
from way over there!
Shino
250115_10_a
Same to you, Shino.
Are you on break too?
Suguha
250115_9_a
Nice work, Suguha.
Shino
250115_8_a
Whew...
Suguha
250115_7_a
Ah, so sorry! I'll just be a
moment!
Suguha
250115_6_a
Are you finished?
Worshiper
250115_5_a
You're right. I'm sorry!
Suguha
250115_4_a
Suguha, be careful. That one is
a different price.
Shino
250115_3_a
Shino
250115_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
Your total is... Uhh...
Suguha
250115_1_a
Right, the interview! If you pass,
you should totally ask if it's
okay for us to work together!
Suguha
250113_23_a
Ah, well, you know, schedules can
be tough to coordinate, and I
need to have an interview...
Shino
250113_22_a
Huh? Well, yeah...
He's my brother.
Suguha
250113_21_a
B-But won't Kazuto be there too?
Shino
250113_20_a
All the more reason for you to
stay at my house! You know,
when you have a shift!
Suguha
250113_19_a
Hmm... It'd be nice to work
together, but it's so far away...
Shino
250113_18_a
And then you take their part-time
job and start at the same time!
Suguha
250113_17_a
This is actually pretty close to
my house. Wait, how about this?
I'll choose this one...
Suguha
250113_16_a
I decided it was too far from
my house, and it looked like
hard work, to boot.
Shino
250113_15_a
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I saw their
job listing in a magazine.
Shino
250113_14_a
Hey, now that you mention it,
I think this shrine is hiring
part-timers.
Shino
250113_13_a
You think they would've just said
they couldn't take anyone on
for a work-study program.
Suguha
250113_12_a
Yeah. It's the start of the new
year, which is their busiest time.
Shino
250113_11_a
Helping out at a shrine, you mean?
Suguha
250113_10_a
Okay, let's talk about this one.
Shino
250113_9_a
Well, I don't work all those jobs
because I want to... Here, let me
see that list.
Shino
250113_8_a
Besides, I've heard you have like
a million part-time jobs, so I
figured you'd have some pointers.
Suguha
250113_7_a
I-I'm not that much older than
you...
Shino
250113_6_a
Exactly! I wanted to get the
opinion of someone far older
and wiser than myself!
Suguha
250113_5_a
So that's why you came to me?
Shino
250113_4_a
Yeah, and Kazuto was actually
making it harder to decide.
Suguha
250113_3_a
Suguha
250113_2_a
bg_os_town_2
A work-study program, eh?
Shino
250113_1_a
Gee, thanks...
Kazuto
250111_20_a
That's the first good idea you've
had all day!
Suguha
250111_19_a
Oh yeah, you're right!
Suguha
250111_18_a
You've got a lot of older friends
you could talk to, don't you?
Kazuto
250111_17_a
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
You're right. Why don't
you ask someone else?
Kazuto
250111_16_a
This has nothing to do with you,
so you're barely paying attention!
Suguha
250111_15_a
If this were VR or something else
you were super into, you'd be full
of ideas. But noooo!
Suguha
250111_14_a
I was just trying to help!
Geez...
Kazuto
250111_13_a
Did you even hear what I was
asking myself? Easy doesn't always
equal fun, y'know!
Suguha
250111_12_a
Why don't you just pick the
easiest one?
Kazuto
250111_11_a
Yeah, I know. Which one sounds
like the most fun?
Suguha
250111_10_a
Ah yeah, tourism would be big in
Kawagoe. It does have the nickname
Little Edo, after all.
Kazuto
250111_9_a
So the options are things like
tour guide, store manager, and
assistant at a shrine or temple.
Suguha
250111_8_a
Well, this time around they're all
jobs that are deeply tied to their
location.
Suguha
250111_7_a
Oh yeah? What are your options?
Kazuto
250111_6_a
But I can't decide on one.
Suguha
250111_5_a
My school's got a bunch of
different work-study classes
on offer...
Suguha
250111_4_a
What's wrong?
Kazuto
250111_3_a
Kazuto
250111_2_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
What should I do...?
Suguha
250111_1_a
Definitely!
Asuna
250108_22_a
We'll find our quarry this time
for sure!
Alice
250108_21_a
Now, come. Let's return these
kimonos and reunite with our
comrades.
Alice
250108_20_a
You are?
Hehe, that's good to hear!
Asuna
250108_19_a
It's fine. I'm used to it at this
point.
Alice
250108_18_a
Yeah, I guess so... Sorry. Hehe.
Asuna
250108_17_a
Asuna. Kirito's penchant for
trivial leisure has rubbed off
on you.
Alice
250108_16_a
And it was a rare opportunity to
dress up, walk around, and goof
off with you, Alice!
Asuna
250108_15_a
But I had a lot of fun today!
And I think we understand
this world more now, too.
Asuna
250108_14_a
And these fortune-boosting kimonos
didn't help at all, either.
Alice
250108_13_a
sigh
...
All that effort for naught.
Alice
250108_12_a
Yeah.
Asuna
250108_11_a
I just hope the others had better
luck than we did...
Alice
250108_10_a
We spent too long chasing down
that thief... Ah well. It was a
worthy cause.
Alice
250108_9_a
After we return our kimonos,
let's contact them and pick a
place to meet.
Asuna
250108_8_a
Hold up, Alice. It's time to
meet with Kirito and Eugeo.
Asuna
250108_7_a
Indeed. Now, we've wasted enough
time. Let's head out of town.
Alice
250108_6_a
Yeah, for sure. The parents' sins
are their own
kids shouldn't
have to suffer for them.
Asuna
250108_5_a
I'm happy we could help.
Alice
250108_4_a
Asuna
250108_3_a
Alice
250108_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Wow! My allowance!
You got it back!
Child
250108_1_a
You would speak on his behalf?
Very well
then I shall sheathe
my blade.
Alice
250107_15_a
Oh, uh... Actually, Alice, he's
seen the error of his ways.
Come on, let's forgive him.
Asuna
250107_14_a
Asuna, what are you whispering
about with that scoundrel?
Alice
250107_13_a
Eh. It's a high-risk, high-reward
profession. It's just part of the
charm of it.
Noble Thief
250107_12_a
Really? Life must be hard for a
Fallen Noble Thief.
Asuna
250107_11_a
Besides, failing this quest means
I get a pretty harsh punishment
already...
Noble Thief
250107_10_a
H-Hey, stop! Seriously, I don't
want to deal with the death
penalty!
Noble Thief
250107_9_a
Of course you will. After I take
it from your cold, dead corpse.
Alice
250107_8_a
H-Hold it! Stop! I give up!
I'll return the cash!!
Noble Thief
250107_7_a
Your head is mine, villain!
Alice
250107_6_a
Oof!!
Noble Thief
250107_5_a
Take thiiis!
Asuna
250107_4_a
An ambush?! Blegh!
Noble Thief
250107_3_a
Alice! Leave this to me!
Asuna
250107_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Asuna!
Alice
250107_1_a
I see...
Asuna
250105_29_a
Do too many bad deeds and you
become a "Fallen Noble Thief."
Player A
250105_28_a
Totally. Lots of Noble Thieves try
to cut their moral lines too close
and get slapped with a penalty.
Player A
250105_27_a
But, whatever the motive, stealing
from kids feels like it's going
too far.
Asuna
250105_26_a
They all dig the romance of being
a swashbuckling hero.
Player A
250105_25_a
Yeah. Most of the people who go
for Noble Thief love playing the
virtuous rogue.
Player A
250105_24_a
Well, okay... I guess the player
has at least some potentially
noble ulterior motive...
Asuna
250105_23_a
Yeah. All the kids who were
robbed? Their parents were
corrupt nobles and merchants.
Player A
250105_22_a
But "Noble Thief" makes me think
of Robin Hood characters, like
Nezumi Kozo.
Asuna
250105_21_a
So the person who stole that kid's
money wasn't an NPC, but a player?
Asuna
250105_20_a
I guess they wanted to add a dash
of historical realism to the game
by putting them in.
Player A
250105_19_a
Yeah. That character archetype
pops up a lot in Japanese history,
and this is a Japanese VRMMO.
Player A
250105_18_a
Really?
Asuna
250105_17_a
Well, in Asuka Empire, you can job
change to a Noble Thief class if
you meet the requirements.
Player A
250105_16_a
Y-Yeah, actually...
Asuna
250105_15_a
Yeah, you didn't know? Oh man,
are you a noob or something?
Player A
250105_14_a
Wait, what?
"Player"?
Asuna
250105_13_a
Hey there. So you're looking
for that thief player too, huh?
???
250105_12_a
...
Asuna
250105_11_a
Of course!
Alice
250105_10_a
Can you search that maze of
tiny alleys on the west side of
town?
Asuna
250105_9_a
Actually, forget it.
I'll go check the main street.
Asuna
250105_8_a
But...?
Alice
250105_7_a
Y-Yeah, I'm down with that...
I feel bad for the kids and all
too. But...
Asuna
250105_6_a
Asuna! We must find this villain,
bring them to justice, and
recover these gifts!
Alice
250105_5_a
Stealing from the weak...
That unscrupulous fiend!
Alice
250105_4_a
someone's going around stealing
the allowance of kids from wealthy
families.
Asuna
250105_3_a
Alice
250105_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
So from what that guy and some
other people in town told us,
Asuna
250105_1_a
Thief...?
Alice
250103_18_a
I'm this child's father! And
I tell you, it was that thief! The
one everyone's talking about!
???
250103_17_a
Umm, hi. Who are you?
Asuna
250103_16_a
It was them, I tell you!
It had to be!
???
250103_15_a
Yeah, you said it.
Asuna
250103_14_a
But regardless, anyone who would
steal a gift from a child is a
true villain. I demand justice.
Alice
250103_13_a
These customs and feelings are
unfathomable for an Integrity
Knight such as I.
Alice
250103_12_a
For parents in any world, kids are
like little treasures, and they
show their love through presents.
Asuna
250103_11_a
Y-Yeah? But there's no harm in
that, right? Parents love their
kids, and vice versa.
Asuna
250103_10_a
A gift... Did we not just see a
similar custom for Christmas
only a few days past?
Alice
250103_9_a
Well...yeah? Kids can't work, so
it's a gift. You know, to make
them happy?
Asuna
250103_8_a
This valuable commodity is simply
GIVEN to children just because
it's New Year's?
Alice
250103_7_a
Money? Money is earned through
hard labor and the sweat of one's
brow, or exchanged for goods.
Alice
250103_6_a
Well... In this culture, parents
and older relatives give children
money as a New Year's present.
Asuna
250103_5_a
New Year's allowance?
What is that?
Alice
250103_4_a
My New Year's allowance!
It was stolen!
Child
250103_3_a
Asuna
250103_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Is everything all right, child?
Alice
250103_1_a
Hmm... I think that kid's an
NPC... Maybe we triggered
some event...
Asuna
250101_17_a
Let us see what's wrong.
Alice
250101_16_a
Waaah! Waaaaaah!!
Child
250101_15_a
That child is crying.
Alice
250101_14_a
What's wrong, Alice?
Asuna
250101_13_a
I... Th-That's... Er...
Alice
250101_12_a
Who cares about that! Now come on!
We must return these kimonos.
Alice
250101_11_a
I... Th-That's... Er...
Alice
250101_10_a
Hehe. We blended in, but you
were just too beautiful to go
unnoticed!
Asuna
250101_9_a
And regardless, these kimonos
definitely did not help us blend
in. Not at all.
Alice
250101_8_a
I concur. We do not need to worry
about drawing unwanted attention
out there.
Alice
250101_7_a
That might be a good idea...
We should return these kimonos
first.
Asuna
250101_6_a
But we've searched every corner
of this town and found nothing.
Should we try the wilds?
Alice
250101_5_a
Well, that Hi-Mob's here
somewhere, and he's got
a Divine Object.
Asuna
250101_4_a
We have been unable to find any
particularly helpful information.
Alice
250101_3_a
Alice
250101_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Hmmm...
Asuna
250101_1_a
This is the best Christmas present
ever... Heh heh heh!
Yuuki
250098_28_a
sniff
Ran...!
Yuuki
250098_27_a
One look at this scarf tells me
that you're right here by my side.
Yuuki
250098_26_a
Thank you, Ran.
Yuuki
250098_25_a
...
Yuuki
250098_24_a
Siune
250098_23_a
That's a good idea.
Silica
250098_22_a
We should give her--well, them--
some time alone.
Siune
250098_21_a
Really? Okay...
Silica
250098_20_a
We should take our leave...
Siune
250098_19_a
Aw, Yuuki...
Say, Silica...
Siune
250098_18_a
Hehe. You know, this is making me
feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Yuuki
250098_17_a
Of course I do. Wow... A Christmas
present from Ran, huh?
Yuuki
250098_16_a
So you believe us?
Silica
250098_15_a
Heh, he would say that.
Yuuki
250098_14_a
Even Kirito says VR can make
miracles happen.
Silica
250098_13_a
That's what I want to believe.
Something that could only
happen in VR.
Silica
250098_12_a
So Ran wanted me to have this...
Yuuki
250098_11_a
...
Yuuki
250098_10_a
Yuuki, you're not going to
believe this, but...
Silica
250098_9_a
What's going on here, Silica?
What's Siune talking about?
Yuuki
250098_8_a
sniff
Oh, Ran...!
Siune
250098_7_a
Wait... Ran? My sister?
Yuuki
250098_6_a
She said she wanted you to have
this scarf, Yuuki.
Siune
250098_5_a
This is what Ran was talking
about. There's no mistaking it.
Siune
250098_4_a
Silica
250098_3_a
Siune
250098_2_a
bg_event_tree_snow_christmas
It's this one, Siune.
Yuuki
250098_1_a
Yes. Yes, you're right.
Siune
250097_27_a
Siune, you should see it for
yourself. Then you'll know
if any of that is true.
Silica
250097_26_a
Yes, that's it!
Siune
250097_25_a
Ran must have sent it to ALO
because she wanted Yuuki
to have it!
Silica
250097_24_a
N-No, I believe you!
Silica
250097_23_a
Forget I ever brought it up. There
must be another explanation.
Siune
250097_22_a
And you know what, something
like that isn't even possible.
Siune
250097_21_a
I'm sorry. That got really serious
and sullen for a moment.
Siune
250097_20_a
Wow...
Silica
250097_19_a
This is adorable! I need to find
the materials to make it so I can
give one to Yuuki! She'd love it.
Siune
250097_18_a
When that scarf was first
introduced to the game, she said,
Siune
250097_17_a
I know... But she played Asuka
Empire when she was alive.
Siune
250097_16_a
H-How can that be?
Ran is...
Silica
250097_15_a
Are you serious?!
Silica
250097_14_a
...a Christmas present from
Yuuki's sister, Ran.
Siune
250097_13_a
I think that scarf might be...
Siune
250097_12_a
Silica, you may not believe this,
but I have to say it.
Siune
250097_11_a
Are you all right, Siune?
Silica
250097_10_a
But... There's no way...
Siune
250097_9_a
Oh, sure. I think Yuuki would
show it to you if you asked.
Silica
250097_8_a
Do you think I could have a look
at that scarf?
Siune
250097_7_a
Uh, yeah, she is. Why do you ask?
Silica
250097_6_a
Yuuki's here, isn't she?
Siune
250097_5_a
Do you know anything about this,
Siune?
Silica
250097_4_a
...
Siune
250097_3_a
Siune
250097_2_a
bg_event_tree_snow_christmas
So, that's what I know.
Silica
250097_1_a
You're right!
I'll go ask her!
Silica
250095_21_a
Ooh, speak of the devil!
Siune's right over there.
Liz
250095_20_a
Ah, that makes sense!
Liz
250095_19_a
so we're wondering if it's an item
from Asuka Empire!
Silica
250095_18_a
The scarf that Yuuki got in the
swap has a really Japanese design,
Silica
250095_17_a
Why so curious?
Liz
250095_16_a
You know, I'm not sure.
She'd probably tell you
if you asked!
Liz
250095_15_a
Does that mean she's been playing
that Japanese-themed VRMMO,
Asuka Empire?
Silica
250095_14_a
Wait, Siune's a member of the
Sleeping Knights, right?
Silica
250095_13_a
She said she was pretty shocked
to see us there too.
Liz
250095_12_a
Oh, wow.
Silica
250095_11_a
Apparently she didn't even have
time to tell Yuuki.
Liz
250095_10_a
Well, she said she got invited by
a friend at the last second and
just barely made it in!
Liz
250095_9_a
Yeah, and here's the crazy part!
You know how guest lists for these
events get pretty crazy?
Liz
250095_8_a
You did?!
Silica
250095_7_a
I see. Oh, you know, I just saw
Siune.
Liz
250095_6_a
Which is why I'm asking you!
Silica
250095_5_a
so I'm trying to help her figure
out what's going on.
Silica
250095_4_a
Yeah, Yuuki feels really weird
about the whole thing,
Silica
250095_3_a
Silica
250095_2_a
bg_event_tree_snow_christmas
Wow, that's really odd...
Liz
250095_1_a
Exactly.
Yuuki
250093_19_a
Right?
Silica
250093_18_a
The problem is how that item got
mixed in with the items at a
player-run event, though.
Silica
250093_17_a
So it's technically possible to
bring items here from other
games.
Yuuki
250093_16_a
I've heard that you can bring a
limited number of items with you
when you convert your avatar.
Yuuki
250093_15_a
Not that crazy, really. Kirito
said all games connected by the
Seed Nexus share basic systems.
Yuuki
250093_14_a
And you think one of the items
from that game made its way
here? That's pretty crazy.
Silica
250093_13_a
Yeah, and it's all Japanese-
themed. Maybe I saw it there.
Yuuki
250093_12_a
Isn't that the VRMMO you played
with the Sleeping Knights?
Silica
250093_11_a
Asuka Empire...
Silica
250093_10_a
Japanese style... Oh!
Maybe I saw it in Asuka Empire?
Yuuki
250093_9_a
That's pretty unusual for a scarf,
if you ask me.
Silica
250093_8_a
It's got a lot of little
chrysanthemums arranged in
a kind of fish-scale pattern.
Silica
250093_7_a
It looks like a pretty classic
Japanese design.
Silica
250093_6_a
Where would I have seen it,
though? In virtual reality,
or in the real world?
Yuuki
250093_5_a
Really? I don't think I've seen
anything like it.
Silica
250093_4_a
I'm pretty sure I've seen it
somewhere before.
Yuuki
250093_3_a
Silica
250093_2_a
bg_event_tree_snow_christmas
You know something?
The design on this scarf...
Yuuki
250093_1_a
Hmmm...
Yuuki
250091_16_a
You're right...
So how did this happen?
Silica
250091_15_a
Only someone like Rain could
hide her name anyway, like
she did at the start.
Yuuki
250091_14_a
But the people holding the event
set up name displays on a system
level, so it should've shown up.
Yuuki
250091_13_a
Maybe whoever made it is just shy?
Silica
250091_12_a
but so far nobody's admitted
to it.
Yuuki
250091_11_a
Yeah. I've been asking around
to see if I could figure out
who gave this to me,
Yuuki
250091_10_a
Seriously?!
Silica
250091_9_a
See, that's the thing...
This was the only gift
with no name on it.
Yuuki
250091_8_a
Yeah, you should have seen the
gifting player's name pop up when
you got your gift.
Silica
250091_7_a
Yeah, it does, but... Look, this
gift swap was set up so you'd know
who you got gifts from, right?
Yuuki
250091_6_a
Ooh, a scarf!
It looks really warm and comfy.
Silica
250091_5_a
Oh, hey Silica.
It's the present I got
at the gift swap.
Yuuki
250091_4_a
What's wrong, Yuuki?
You look pretty out of it.
Silica
250091_3_a

Yuuki
250091_1_a
Hehe, maybe!
Asuna
250089_11_a
Ah, I see. Perhaps that had
something to do with why
the door was locked?
Yui
250089_10_a
It is Christmas, after all.
Someone's always willing
to play Santa!
Asuna
250089_9_a
I'm sure someone would have
discovered it eventually and
brought that medicine.
Asuna
250089_8_a
But if Alice never approached that
child, would the quest ever have
been finished?
Yui
250089_7_a
I personally was surprised that
they managed to complete that
NPC's quest.
Yui
250089_6_a
Yeah... I didn't want to butt in,
but I did want to keep an eye on
Alice to make sure she was okay.
Asuna
250089_5_a
You were checking on Alice and
Eugeo, right, Mommy?
Yui
250089_4_a
But all's well that ends well,
huh?
Asuna
250089_3_a
Yui
250089_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Well, that was unexpected...
Asuna
250089_1_a
Hehe, maybe!
Asuna

Ah, I see. Perhaps that had
something to do with why
the door was locked?
Yui
250088_27_a
It is Christmas, after all.
Someone's always willing
to play Santa!
Asuna
250088_26_a
I'm sure someone would have
discovered it eventually and
brought her that medicine.
Asuna
250088_25_a
But if Alice never approached her
in the church, would the quest
ever have been finished?
Yui
250088_24_a
I personally was surprised that
they managed to complete that
girl's quest.
Yui
250088_23_a
Yeah... I didn't want to butt in,
especially during that long talk
on the nature of the divine...
Asuna
250088_22_a
You were checking on Alice and
Eugeo, right, Mommy?
Yui
250088_21_a
But I guess it all ended up okay?
Asuna
250088_20_a
Yui
250088_19_a
sigh
... That was nerve-wracking.
Asuna
250088_18_a
I suppose so, yes.
Eugeo
250088_17_a
I just hope that girl learns how
to forge her own destiny, rather
than placing her faith in others.
Alice
250088_16_a
She'd probably be quite shocked.
Hmph. This is just one of the many
duties of an Integrity Knight.
Alice
250088_15_a
I see... Imagine how surprised
she'd be if she realized it was
you who gave her that medicine.
Eugeo
250088_14_a
And while I would love to scold
her for her misplaced faith, the
door is locked. Maybe another day.
Alice
250088_13_a
But since my words seemed to have
no effect, I was forced to take
extreme measures.
Alice
250088_12_a
No. I wanted that child to take
matters into her own hands,
and not rely on a miracle.
Alice
250088_11_a
Alice... You planned on doing this
from the beginning, didn't you?
Eugeo
250088_10_a
It's too early to know if that
medicine will help. I'll return
soon to check in on them.
Alice
250088_9_a
Hehe... That kid seemed pretty
happy, huh?

prayers and gave me this miracle!

This is just what Daddy needs!
Now he'll get better for sure!
Child
250088_4_a
What's that on the ground...
Medicine?!
Child
250088_3_a
Hmm, is someone at the door?
Hey, there's no one here...
Child

bg_21_alne_inn
Daddy... Get better soon, okay?
Child
250088_1_a
...
Alice
250087_21_a
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you
have to rub it in the face of a
troubled child...
Eugeo
250087_20_a
You were the one who told me that
the gods of this world aren't
omnipotent...
Alice
250087_19_a
Alice, I know you were trying to
help, but that was cruel.
Eugeo
250087_18_a
Ah...
Alice
250087_17_a
Annnd she ran away crying...
Eugeo
250087_16_a
...Huh?
Alice
250087_15_a
I...you...! I HATE YOU, LADY!!
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE PERSON!!
Child
250087_14_a
Are you so weak that you must rely
on mere hope? Do you not have the
power to help yourself?
Alice
250087_13_a
God will answer my prayers, I just
know it! He'll make everything
okay!!
Child
250087_12_a
N-No! I don't believe you!!
Child
250087_11_a
A-Alice, that was uncalled for...
Eugeo

Child

Eugeo
250087_8_a
Rather than waste your time here
praying for a miracle, go to his
side and comfort him.
Alice
250087_7_a
No way?!
Child
250087_6_a
From what I know of your world,
your god lacks the power to heal
your father.
Alice
250087_5_a
Who I am is of no import.
Alice
250087_4_a
Oh, uh...are you talking to me?
Who are you, lady?
Child

Eugeo
250087_2_a
bg_12_church_lounge
You there, child.
Alice
250087_1_a
Come on, Alice. You said it
earlier, right? Kids should be
able to believe in miracles.
Eugeo
250086_11_a
Besides...people should forge
their own destinies, not place
faith in fairytales.
Alice
250086_10_a
Probably quite shocked, yes...
But this is just one of the many
duties of an Integrity Knight.
Alice
250086_9_a
I see... Heh. Bet that kid'd be
surprised to learn that you were
Santa today, huh?
Eugeo
250086_8_a
I merely thought that children
should be able to believe in
miracles. That is all.
Alice
250086_7_a
Th-That is of no importance.
Alice
250086_6_a
You left that medicine by the door
because you wanted that kid to
believe in Santa, didn't you?
Eugeo
250086_5_a
It's too early to know if that
medicine will help. I'll return
soon to check in on them.
Alice

Hehe... That kid seemed pretty
happy, huh?

Child

is praying.

Apparently, yes. It definitely
feels like a church. It's so...
peaceful here...

I understand that this is a
Christian church.

Y-Yeah, maybe... Don't read too
much into it. It was just a
thought, after all...
Eugeo
250085_13_a
Hmm... I suppose I took your words
too seriously.
Alice
250085_12_a
Er, Alice? You're not angry at me,
are you? It was an innocent
question...
Eugeo
250085_11_a
I will not tolerate any blasphemy
against the Administrator, Eugeo.
Alice
250085_10_a
No, I didn't mean that. I'm just
trying to figure out why people's
faith weakens...
Eugeo
250085_9_a
But you make it sound like gods
both here AND in our world are
flawed, and not omnipotent.
Alice
250085_8_a
Eugeo, hold it right there. Yes,
it does seem like there are many
gods in this world...
Alice
250085_7_a
I guess that's why there are so
many gods here. But we have
a lot in our world too, so...
Eugeo
250085_6_a
If you think a god can solve all
your problems, but it can't, you
might start believing in another.
Eugeo
250085_5_a
You're treading on dangerous
ground, Eugeo... What are you
getting at?
Alice
250085_4_a
But I feel like faith in the
divine grows weak only if
that god isn't omnipotent.
Eugeo
250085_3_a
Alice
250085_2_a
bg_10_kob_room
But yeah, I don't really remember
what it was like in our world. So,
forgive me if I offend...

I knew you were real!

It's...medicine?!
Child 3

If she could just get better, I'm
sure she would have already.
I feel bad for that child...
Eugeo

That...sounds like a pretty tough
gift for "Santa" to give. That
kid's mom must be really sick...
Eugeo

Alice

I... I asked him to help my sick
mommy get better! But he didn't
help at all!
Child 3

Well, I didn't get anything from
him!
Child 3

existence of this Santa character.

Are those kids fighting?
Eugeo
250084_1_a
Er... Maybe you shouldn't leap
to conclusions?
Eugeo
250083_24_a
The way they worship their gods
here seems cursory and crude.
They sully their gods' name.
Alice
250083_23_a
And our people are far more devout
and pious than anyone I've met
here.
Alice
250083_22_a
I doubt you remember, but in
our world, we have a living god:
the High Priest.
Alice
250083_21_a
Yeah, I get that feeling too...
Eugeo
250083_20_a
No, they don't. Especially this
Christmas. For a sacred event, it
seems rather loud--and commercial.
Alice
250083_19_a
Yeah... Their rituals don't seem
as strict as ours.
Eugeo
250083_18_a
However, it seems that the people
here have a very different
relationship with their deities.
Alice
250083_17_a
Well, we worship many gods in our
world too. Stacia, Solus...
Alice
250083_16_a
It seems polytheism is common
here. I just learned that word!
It means "worshipping many gods."
Eugeo
250083_15_a
Hmm... I suppose that over time,
this holy figure of Christ was
elevated to the status of godhood?
Eugeo
250083_14_a
That's a good point. We even
met that one goddess, Urdr.
Eugeo
250083_13_a
I find it interesting that during
our time here, we've learned of a
number of entities called "gods."
Alice
250083_12_a
It appears so. The faithful even
believe Christ is divine:
God, or part of Him, anyway.
Alice
250083_11_a
Wow, so he was a sort of prophet?
I guess he must be pretty revered
then, huh?
Eugeo
250083_10_a
Christ was a man who developed
a religious ideology that spread
like wildfire across the world.
Alice
250083_9_a
Yes, I did. Originally, Christmas
was held to celebrate a historical
figure's birthday.
Alice
250083_8_a
Did you learn anything
interesting?
Eugeo
250083_7_a
Ahh, what a coincidence! So did I!
I was really curious to find out
what all the fuss was about.
Eugeo
250083_6_a
That's correct. I came here to
look into the origins of this
world's holidays, like Christmas.
Alice

Are you here to research
something?

you were here too.

Eugeo

I didn't know that part of it!
Eugeo

kids out of love. Santa makes
children happy, after all!

I will be sure not to push myself.
Alice
250081_7_a
Okay, I'm just glad you're not
coming down with a cold. Have
fun, but take it easy!
Asuna
250081_6_a
A relaxing walk outside might help
restore strength to my tired
limbs.
Alice
250081_5_a
I am healthy, merely a bit weary
from our many battles.
Alice
250081_4_a
Are you feeling okay, Alice?
Asuna
250081_3_a
Asuna
250081_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Asuna, I need to go outside and
take in the air.
Alice
250081_1_a
But...why would this Santa Claus
be so charitable? What does he
stand to gain?
Alice
250080_19_a
It's the most wonderful and unique
part about the whole holiday!
Eugeo
250080_18_a
I found out that on Christmas Day,
Santa Claus brings presents to all
the good little children!
Eugeo
250080_17_a
I wanted to learn about Christmas,
so I've been asking around.
Eugeo
250080_16_a
Eugeo? What are you doing here?
Alice
250080_15_a
Alice
250080_14_a
They're talking about Santa Claus,
Alice.
Eugeo
250080_13_a
Santa? Who is this "Santa"
these children speak of?
Alice
250080_12_a
I need to write a letter to Santa
and ask for all the things I want!
Child 2
250080_11_a
Yay! Yippee! Woohoo!
It's Christmas! I wonder
what I'll get this year!

Alice
250080_1_a
Ha ha, of course. Duh?
Kirito
250078_29_a
F-Fine, but guys and girls get in
separately!
Leafa
250078_28_a
Yeah, you got it. I'd love to keep
this as a secret emergency hot
spring myself too.
Kirito
250078_27_a
A-Anyway, just promise us not to
tell anyone about this spot, okay?
Silica
250078_26_a
N-Nope, not a thing!
Leafa
250078_25_a
Hmm? Did you say something, Sugu?
Kirito
250078_24_a
Thank goodness this steam
prevented HIM from getting
a glimpse...
Leafa
250078_23_a
And I just wanted to find a place
where I could bathe in peace,
without people staring at me...
Leafa
250078_22_a
I wish I could've taken a dip,
though...
Kirito
250078_21_a
It's a shame I couldn't try the
water in town, but I'm glad the
place you built is booming.
Kirito
250078_20_a
Oh, that makes sense...
Leafa
250078_19_a
So, I decided to go fly around and
see if I could find a natural hot
spring. And I just did! Hurrah!
Kirito
250078_18_a
But the guys' springs were super
crowded and there was no way I
was getting in...
Kirito
250078_17_a
Well, I wanted to check out that
hot spring resort town you guys
built...
Kirito
250078_16_a
You say that, but...
What are you doing all the
way out here, anyway?
Leafa
250078_15_a
H-Hey, it's fine!
I can't see anything.
Kirito
250078_14_a
Seriously, you can never let down
your guard with him...
Leafa
250078_13_a
Kirito
250078_12_a
Leafa
250078_11_a
bg_11_forest_yui
This is...surprising...
Silica
250078_10_a
Don't find us! We're not wearing
anything!
Leafa
250078_9_a
Yeah! I can't see anything with
all this steam, but I'll try to
find you.
Kirito
250078_8_a
Kirito? Is that you?
Silica
250078_7_a
Sugu? Silica?
Kirito
250078_6_a
I know that voice!
Silica
250078_5_a
WHAT?!
Leafa
250078_4_a
Silica
250078_3_a
Leafa
250078_2_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Huh...?
???
250078_1_a
...!
Leafa
250077_18_a
Someone's there!
Silica
250077_17_a
Wh-What?! What is it, Silica?!
Leafa
250077_16_a
Wait a sec! Hold up!
Silica
250077_15_a
Mmm, oh yeah... So warm...
I can finally kick back and
relax...
Leafa
250077_14_a
Leafa
250077_13_a
Ohhh yeaaah...
That feels good!
Silica
250077_12_a
I'm so ready for this!
It does look pretty hot, though...
Leafa
250077_11_a
Let's get in and see how the
water feels.
Silica
250077_10_a
I declare this our own, private
hot spring!
Leafa
250077_9_a
Woohoo! Quest complete!
Leafa
250077_8_a
bg_event_hot_springs
Wow! We found it! An honest to
goodness mountain hot spring!
Silica
250077_7_a
Already on it!
Silica
250077_6_a
Yeah! Let's search the area and
see what we can find!
Leafa
250077_5_a
I bet there's a hot spring around
here!
Silica
250077_4_a
Yeah, but smell that? Sulfur!
Silica
250077_3_a
Silica
250077_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
The fog's gotten really thick...
Leafa
250077_1_a
Hmm, that could make sense...
You might be right!
Leafa
250075_28_a
That could be steam rising
from it!
Silica
250075_27_a
If there's a natural hot spring
around here...
Silica
250075_26_a
Get...what?
Leafa
250075_25_a
This fog... Do you think it really
is fog?
Silica
250075_24_a
No... I think it might be a better
idea to keep going.
Silica
250075_23_a
I see what they mean. It is
getting a bit foggy. Maybe we
should turn back?
Leafa
250075_22_a
This area is generally considered
too risky to come to.
Silica
250075_21_a
Yeah... People say that the fog
gets very thick out here and
it's easy to get lost.
Silica
250075_20_a
Yeah... We never even came out
here when we were building the
town...
Leafa
250075_19_a
bg_11_forest_yui
We've flown pretty far into these
mountains... There's no one
around for miles...
Silica
250075_18_a
Don't mention it!
Silica
250075_17_a
Y-Yeah... Okay! Let's do it!
Thanks for having my back, Silica!
Leafa
250075_16_a
Of course! We may even get lucky
and find a hidden mountain hot
spring, no digging required!
Silica
250075_15_a
Silica... Are you sure...?
Leafa
250075_14_a
Now let's go find us a hot spring
to dig!
Silica
250075_13_a
Well...
Leafa
250075_12_a
And that means that I want to do
everything I can to help you!
As a friend!
Silica
250075_11_a
No, you're right. Maybe a girl of
my proportions can't really feel
your pain, but I can imagine!
Silica
250075_10_a
Ahaha, yeah... If it was just me
being paranoid, I'd get over it,
but...
Leafa
250075_9_a
I think I know what you mean.
I know a lot of girls-me included-
who uh, compare themselves...
Silica
250075_8_a
But now that I've, ahem, matured
a bit, it's kinda gotten awkward
for me...
Leafa
250075_7_a
O-Oh... That makes sense...
Silica
250075_6_a
Oh, no like, SUPER little kids!
It was a really long time ago!!
Leafa
250075_5_a
Wh-Wh-Whaaaaat?!
Silica
250075_4_a
No, not at all! I even used to
take baths with Kazuto all the
time when we were little kids...
Leafa
250075_3_a
Leafa
250075_2_a
bg_02_fountain
I'm still surprised you're shy
about going to a public bath.
Were you always like that?
Silica
250075_1_a
Yeah... You know...
Silica
250073_18_a
I mean, it's not like it's a bunch
of guys ogling me or anything...
Leafa
250073_17_a
I should just stop whining and
deal with all the sidelong looks.
Leafa
250073_16_a
S-Silica, I appreciate the
thought, but you don't have
to do all that.
Leafa
250073_15_a
Oh, that's it! I'll just have Pina
find a hot spring spot for us!
Silica
250073_14_a
Hmm... Good point. But the entire
mountain should have the same
water underground...
Silica
250073_13_a
That won't be easy... Remember
how much trouble we had finding
the right water for town?
Leafa
250073_12_a
You mean...dig our own, private
hot spring somewhere?
Leafa
250073_11_a
That means we can dig new hot
springs outside of town!
Silica
250073_10_a
We dug a hot spring on the other
side of the mountain for the ape
monsters that live here, right?
Silica
250073_9_a
Get...what?
Leafa
250073_8_a
But... Hmm... I might just have
the solution!
Silica
250073_7_a
H-Hey, can we stop talking about
this, already?
Leafa
250073_6_a
You definitely aren't lacking
anything in that department
as Suguha, either!
Silica
250073_5_a
Well, only in VRMMOs, anyway...
Leafa
250073_4_a
Now I know you won't have fun even
if we have a chance to go to one
together...
Silica
250073_3_a
Leafa
250073_2_a
bg_02_fountain
But this really takes the wind out
of my hot spring sails...
Silica
250073_1_a
Silica... You don't understand...
Leafa
250071_19_a
But I really am jealous, Leafa.
It's a good problem to have...
Silica
250071_18_a
N-No worries, Silica...
Leafa
250071_17_a
sigh
Sorry, that was out
of line... I'm just a little
oversensitive about this...
Silica
250071_16_a
I'm not trying to brag!
It really is embarrassing!
Leafa
250071_15_a
It's because you're so... I mean,
you h-have such... I mean...
Y-You know what I mean!
Silica
250071_14_a
Grrr... You know why, and
you're rubbing it in my face!
Silica
250071_13_a
I always get the feeling people
are staring at me whenever I'm
in a public hot spring...
Leafa
250071_12_a
You're sure?
Silica
250071_11_a
It's kinda embarrassing...
Leafa
250071_10_a
W-Well, I am... It's just... I'm
not good with getting, uh, in
the buff in front of people...
Leafa
250071_9_a
I just kinda assumed you were a
big hot spring fan...
Silica
250071_8_a
Huh? You don't want to, Leafa?
Silica
250071_7_a
Silica... You're totally addicted,
aren't you?
Leafa
250071_6_a
Oh, I have an idea! Do you want to
take a dip in some hot springs?
Silica
250071_5_a
You said it. But I'm beat... I
could use some relaxation time...
Silica
250071_4_a
You too, Silica! Today's quest
was tough, but totally worth it!
Leafa
250071_3_a
Leafa
250071_2_a
bg_02_fountain
Leafa! Thanks for everything!
Silica
250071_1_a
Fingers crossed it works!
Leafa
250068_21_a
You got it! Ooh, I can't wait!
Liz
250068_20_a
Hehe, sounds like a plan. Let's
go fill in the rest of the white
team!
Leafa
250068_19_a
Yeah, it'd be best if we can sneak
them on in the last half...or
better yet, the finale!
Liz
250068_18_a
It's all about timing!
Leafa
250068_17_a
the competition is already over.
Check and mate.
Liz
250068_16_a
Yep. It'd be perfect if we could
fix it so that by the time they
realize they've been outwitted,
Liz
250068_15_a
the other teams will notice that
our players are moving too quick
for their stats.
Leafa
250068_14_a
Ahh, that's a great idea!
If we used them in the first event
of the day,
Leafa
250068_13_a
In other words, we hold off until
the last possible moment, then
turn everything around!
Liz
250068_12_a
So we need to keep this particular
ace up our sleeve until it really
matters.
Liz
250068_11_a
Right now, our secret weapon
goes bye-bye the second someone
notices it, right?
Liz
250068_10_a
And that means?
Leafa
250068_9_a
Hmmm... We need to choose our
battles.
Liz
250068_8_a
The only problem is, what do we do
if they DO notice...
Leafa
250068_7_a
The debuffs need to target our
shoes specifically or they won't
dispel their effect.
Liz
250068_6_a
Even if they cast debuffs on us,
we're safe as long as they don't
realize we're wearing magic boots.
Liz
250068_5_a
Now we can have our buff and eat
it too, hehe. The other teams
will have no idea!
Leafa
250068_4_a
That's amazing! Heaven's Flight
looks like a totally normal pair
of shoes now!
Liz
250068_3_a
Liz
250068_2_a
bg_02_fountain_sunset
It works... IT WORKS!!
Leafa
250068_1_a
G-Gah! Running!
Leafa
250067_18_a
Ahh! The tide's coming back in!
Save the spell for later
we gotta get out of here!
Liz
250067_17_a
Hehe, shouldn't have expected
anything less! Alright then,
give it a quick test!
Liz
250067_16_a
Nope, everything looks good!
I think I can cast it right now!
Leafa
250067_15_a
So you don't need to train any
more then?
Liz
250067_14_a
Hmm, my level and skill check out,
so...yeah, I should be good to go!
Leafa
250067_13_a
Well, assuming I fulfill the
requirements to learn the spell...
Leafa
250067_12_a
Now you just need to memorize it,
and test it out on Heaven's
Flight.
Liz
250067_11_a
Finally! That Sylph spell is as
good as mine!
Leafa
250067_10_a
It's a spell book!
Liz
250067_9_a
item_03_treasure_box
Let's open it and see what's
inside.
Leafa
250067_8_a
Hey Leafa, look!
A treasure chest!
Liz
250067_7_a
Yeah, no time to waste.
Leafa
250067_6_a
Which means we better hightail it
or we're gonna end up very,
very wet.
Liz
250067_5_a
The tide only recedes enough to
give access to the caves once
a month, for a very short time.
Leafa
250067_4_a
We did it!
Leafa
250067_3_a
Leafa
250067_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
Yay! We finally made it inside
the cave!
Liz
250067_1_a
Aw, you're just saying that.
Leafa
250065_25_a
Oh! Then you were looking up the
tide times!
Liz
250065_24_a
No--we gotta go back at low tide!
Leafa
250065_23_a
Urgh, diving into that...?
Liz
250065_22_a
Which means there's only one way
of finding that cave.
Leafa
250065_21_a
Yeah, that western ocean...
It seems it's always stormy this
time of year.
Leafa
250065_20_a
What is it? You look like you've
been looking into something ever
since we got back to town.
Liz
250065_19_a
...
Leafa
250065_18_a
Me too. Working hard without
seeing solid results is super
draining...
Leafa
250065_17_a
bg_02_fountain
Phew, I'm wiped...
Liz
250065_16_a
Yeah...
Leafa
250065_15_a
Unfortunately, I think we're gonna
have to come back another day...
Liz
250065_14_a
Either way, I don't think we're
gonna get much farther today.
Liz
250065_13_a
It'd make sense to hide a spell
using the spell itself! It'd be
cool, at least!
Leafa
250065_12_a
Hmm... The spell changes a thing's
appearance, right? Maybe this
choppy sea is just an illusion?
Leafa
250065_11_a
Hey, you think they made the water
here rough on purpose to hide
the cave entrance?
Liz
250065_10_a
Hahaha, yeah...
You're probably right.
Leafa
250065_9_a
You'd probably drown the moment
you dove in.
Liz
250065_8_a
The ocean looks a little rough
today, and you're a terrible
swimmer.
Liz
250065_7_a
I'd rather avoid that if at
all possible...
Liz
250065_6_a
Maybe we're supposed to look for
it under the water...?
Leafa
250065_5_a
Not at all... Even flying wouldn't
help us spot it.
Leafa
250065_4_a
That cave just doesn't want to
be found, does it?
Liz
250065_3_a
Liz
250065_2_a
bg_event_north_sea
Hmmm...
Leafa
250065_1_a
Alright, then what are we waiting
for? Let's go!
Liz
250063_18_a
A cave somewhere around the
western coast of Sylph territory.
Leafa
250063_17_a
So, where do we go for the quest?
Liz
250063_16_a
That's a great idea! Thanks, Liz!
Leafa
250063_15_a
That way, once you learn the
spell, we can test to see if the
camouflage works or not!
Liz
250063_14_a
I'll come with you! And I'll
bring Heaven's Flight, too.
Liz
250063_13_a
Right? Anyway, I think I have to
take on a tough quest if I'm going
to learn that spell.
Leafa
250063_12_a
That's a relief. I'd hate to have
her as an enemy.
Liz
250063_11_a
Yep.
Leafa
250063_10_a
She's not participating in the
competition, is she?
Liz
250063_9_a
Sakuya told me about it when I
went to see her earlier.
Leafa
250063_8_a
It's special magic only Sylphs can
use that can camouflage equipment.
Leafa
250063_7_a
What kind of spell?
Liz
250063_6_a
Well, it involves memorizing a new
spell, but if we can do that
I think we have a chance.
Leafa
250063_5_a
Really?! Tell me!
Liz
250063_4_a
Hey Liz! Good timing! I just
thought of the perfect plan!
Leafa
250063_3_a
Leafa
250063_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
How's it going, Leafa?
Liz
250063_1_a
Go right ahead. I was hoping you'd
share more details about all of
this with me.
Sakuya
250061_21_a
Thanks! Oh, and I was wondering...
Would you mind if I asked you
something?
Leafa
250061_20_a
But I'll be cheering you and the
white team on in spirit.
Sakuya
250061_19_a
My lips are sealed. I've got other
plans that day, so I won't be able
to watch you compete...
Sakuya
250061_18_a
We're still trying to figure out a
way we can use those shoes to
our advantage.
Leafa
250061_17_a
Please don't tell anyone else
about our secret plans or
anything, okay?
Leafa
250061_16_a
Pretty much... Oh, also, uhh...
I told you all this because
you're not in the competition...
Leafa
250061_15_a
I see. So you're still
experimenting with solutions to
your problem?
Sakuya
250061_14_a
It seems everything we think up
just won't cut it.
Leafa
250061_13_a
But if we use them, the other
teams will just debuff them,
making the whole thing pointless.
Leafa
250061_12_a
Then Liz made these rare shoes
called "Heaven's Flight" because
she thought they might help...
Leafa
250061_11_a
We thought we might be able to
make up for that by using buffs
on ourselves.
Leafa
250061_10_a
Well, I feel like our team isn't
quite as strong as the other
teams are...
Leafa
250061_9_a
What do you have to work with?
Sakuya
250061_8_a
But all of our ideas aren't really
amounting to much.
Leafa
250061_7_a
Liz and I are on the white team
together. We've been trying to
come up with a strategy...
Leafa
250061_6_a
We're still getting ready.
Leafa
250061_5_a
I hear you are preparing for the
sports day competition. How are
things going?
Sakuya
250061_4_a
Hi Sakuya!
Leafa
250061_3_a
Leafa
250061_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
Oh, hello Leafa.
Sakuya
250061_1_a
S-Sure thing, little one.
But only for a moment...
Alice
250058_26_a
Hehe, I think you made a friend.
Asuna
250058_25_a
Yeah! Hurry up, I wanna see!
Child
250058_24_a
What? Here?! NOW?!
Alice
250058_23_a
Try it on! Try it on!
Child
250058_22_a
Yay! She said she'll take it!
Child
250058_21_a
But...
Oh, very well. Thank you.
Alice
250058_20_a
You were the true hero today.
You deserve it more than I do.
Asuna
250058_19_a
Me? But why?
Alice
250058_18_a
Alice, I want you to have this.
Asuna
250058_17_a
I'm sorry, but I can
only spare one...
Fairy NPC
250058_16_a
Wow! Halloween equipment!
Asuna
250058_15_a
I'd like to thank you as well.
It's not much, but I'd like you
to have this.
Fairy NPC
250058_14_a
Don't mention it.
We're just glad you're safe.
Asuna
250058_13_a
Thank you so much, ladies!
Both of you!
Child
250058_12_a
Alice...
Asuna
250058_11_a
But that's impossible.
I'm imagining things.
Alice
250058_10_a
I...feel like I once knew a girl
her age...
Alice
250058_9_a
Okay, out with whatever it is.
Why are you staring at her?
Asuna
250058_8_a
Y-Yes, I suppose we did.
Alice
250058_7_a
We did a good thing today, Alice.
Asuna
250058_6_a
Wait...
Alice
250058_5_a
Daughter! I'm so happy
you're all right!
Fairy NPC
250058_4_a
Asuna
250058_3_a
Alice
250058_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Waaaaaah!
Daddy!! I was so scared!!
Child
250058_1_a
Yeah! Let's find that girl and
get her out of here!
Asuna
250057_20_a
A demon! After it!
Alice
250057_19_a
Over there!
Asuna
250057_18_a
Skrrraaawr!!
???
250057_17_a
You're...right. Let's go.
Alice
250057_16_a
So stop analyzing yourself
and let's get moving!
Asuna
250057_15_a
Asuna...
Alice
250057_14_a
That part of you that's telling
you to save a child, no matter
the cost? I think it's right.
Asuna
250057_13_a
That is...curious. But you
shouldn't doubt yourself
right now.
Asuna
250057_12_a
And yet, it feels like some part
of me I never knew was there is
screaming at me to act.
Alice
250057_11_a
It's curious. Unlike Eugeo,
my memories are intact and
my mind fully my own.
Alice
250057_10_a
I see...
Asuna
250057_9_a
Before I knew it, I was taking
action. I will not sit idly by.
I cannot.
Alice
250057_8_a
But when that merchant told us
his daughter was in great peril,
something within me cried out.
Alice
250057_7_a
Or...so I thought.
Alice
250057_6_a
That purpose has consumed my life.
The year's harvest or the fate of
a family has never mattered to me.
Alice
250057_5_a
As I said before, my duty as an
Integrity Knight is to battle the
enemies of the Light.
Alice
250057_4_a
Alice...
Asuna
250057_3_a
Asuna
250057_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_sao
You're right. It is unlike me.
Alice
250057_1_a
Wait...
Alice
250055_23_a
Sorry, I shouldn't be so
surprised. A girl's been
kidnapped-of course you're upset.
Asuna
250055_22_a
I ain't sayin' nothin'!
Alice
250055_21_a
Well, I've just never seen you
this agitated before...
Asuna
250055_20_a
Asuna... Is something wrong?
Alice
250055_19_a
S-Sure...
Asuna
250055_18_a
Come on! We must hurry!
Alice
250055_17_a
bg_event_dungeon_sao
Asuna! We have her location!
Alice
250055_16_a
Y-You'll help me?! Thank you!
The last I saw them, they were...
Fairy NPC
250055_15_a
Good sir, do you know where these
demons have taken her?!
Alice
250055_14_a
Oh, you bet I am.
Asuna
250055_13_a
I will save this girl.
Are you with me, Asuna?
Alice
250055_12_a
I ain't sayin' nothin'!
Alice
250055_11_a
She's just a child! Oh, it pains
me to imagine what horrors
they're subjecting her to!
Fairy NPC
250055_10_a
Evil demons kidnapped my
beloved little girl!
Fairy NPC
250055_9_a
Excuse me, sir. Could you
tell us what happened?
Asuna
250055_8_a
Please! Anyone! Save my daughter!
Fairy NPC
250055_7_a
It looks like the owner of that
Halloween item shop.
Asuna
250055_6_a
That fairy merchant appears to be
upset about something.
Alice
250055_5_a
Huh?
Asuna
250055_4_a
Alice
250055_3_a
Asuna
250055_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
S-Someone, help!
???
250055_1_a
Alice...
Asuna
250053_21_a
I find it all strangely...
familiar.
Alice
250053_20_a
And yet, this talk of harvest
festivals and old traditions...
It tugs at something within me...
Alice
250053_19_a
I have never known what life is
like for the common folk, nor have
I ever cared to learn...
Alice
250053_18_a
I am an Integrity Knight, sworn to
battle the Forces of Darkness.
My life is war.
Alice
250053_17_a
Strange? What is?
Asuna
250053_16_a
How strange...
Alice
250053_15_a
Wait...
Alice
250053_14_a
Oh, uh... Ha ha.
Yeah, I guess they have.
Asuna
250053_13_a
And now these ancient tales have
been proven true by the Dread
Bastion's appearance.
Alice
250053_12_a
So I guess it's something we've
inherited from our ancestors'
superstitions.
Asuna
250053_11_a
Long ago, people thought that
evil spirits appeared with the
coming of the cold weather.
Asuna
250053_10_a
Good question! Apparently, it has
to do with winter.
Asuna
250053_9_a
However, I still don't see the
connection between donning the
guise of monsters and the harvest.
Alice
250053_8_a
H-Hey, maybe it does? Ha ha...
Asuna
250053_7_a
Perhaps the appearance of this
demonic castle has something to do
with your Halloween tradition?
Alice
250053_6_a
Interesting. So it is an ancient
and revered tradition among
your people.
Alice
250053_5_a
Nowadays, the history is mostly
ignored and people just dress up
as monsters and have fun.
Asuna
250053_4_a
I read that it was originally a
harvest festival where people
thanked the gods for their crops.
Asuna
250053_3_a
Alice
250053_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
Halloween is a sort of holiday
that happens around this time
every year.
Asuna
250053_1_a
Okay... Where do I begin...
Asuna
250051_20_a
Just what exactly is this
"Halloween"?
Alice
250051_19_a
Er...
Asuna
250051_18_a
You also mentioned it during our
battles here the other day.
Alice
250051_17_a
There's that word again,
"Halloween."
Alice
250051_16_a
Hehe, this is going to be fun!
Asuna
250051_15_a
Whoa, this place is filled with
Halloween decorations!
I love it!
Asuna
250051_14_a
bg_event_devil_castle_01
We're here.
Alice
250051_13_a
Very well, I shall guide you.
Alice
250051_12_a
They might be selling something
that'll help us in the battles
ahead. It's worth checking out.
Asuna
250051_11_a
Yeah, I guess so...
Hey Alice, mind taking me
to see this fairy town?
Asuna
250051_10_a
Interesting... So these demons
possess a modicum of reason-unlike
the monsters we've faced before.
Alice
250051_9_a
Ahaha, good point! My guess is
that they made demon friends and
are part of demon society now.
Asuna
250051_8_a
But fairies and demons are bitter
enemies! How can fairies live in
the very heart of darkness?
Alice
250051_7_a
Oh yeah, I heard about that.
Apparently, they sell unique
items there.
Asuna
250051_6_a
It looks like... Ah yes, what
you call a "shopping arcade."
Alice
250051_5_a
I have discovered a fairy town
within the Dread Bastion!
Alice
250051_4_a
What's the problem, Alice?
Asuna
250051_3_a
Asuna
250051_2_a
bg_event_devil_castle_02
Asuna! Trouble!
Alice
250051_1_a
Absolutely!
Eugeo
250048_25_a
Then let us return to the
log cabin.
Alice
250048_24_a
Understood. That's only fair.
Eugeo
250048_23_a
I will only agree to learn it,
however, if I deem it useful.
Alice
250048_22_a
Really?
Eugeo
250048_21_a
Perhaps it would behoove me to
ask Asuna about this technique
when we return.
Alice
250048_20_a
I also do not wish to be so
pig-headed that I attack those who
mean well, as those dragons did.
Alice
250048_19_a
...I see your point.
Alice
250048_18_a
And I'm of the opinion that we
should be prepared for any and
every event on the battlefield.
Eugeo
250048_17_a
but Asuna's technique requires
a partner to perform.
Eugeo
250048_16_a
A lot of our techniques are geared
toward fighting solo,
Eugeo
250048_15_a
Ha ha! Look, I can't force you to
learn it, but hear me out.
Eugeo
250048_14_a
Urgh...
Alice
250048_13_a
Hmph!
Alice
250048_12_a
You said it, not me...
Eugeo
250048_11_a
Well, I wasn't going to take it
that far, but...
Eugeo
250048_10_a
Do you mean to imply that I too
am being willfully ignorant by
refusing to learn that technique?
Alice
250048_9_a
Hmph!
Alice
250048_8_a
Hah! Oh, ahem... Nothing!
Eugeo
250048_7_a
What are you laughing at?
Alice
250048_6_a
Hahaha!
Eugeo
250048_5_a
It took an act of willful
ignorance to attack us when we
were simply trying to help!
Alice
250048_4_a
I swear...
Their stupidity knows no bounds!
Alice
250048_3_a
Alice
250048_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Whew... That got off to a rocky
start, but all's well that ends
well, I suppose!
Eugeo
250048_1_a
...
Alice
250047_28_a
Ha ha!
I think they're saying goodbye.
Eugeo
250047_27_a
Chirp chirp!
Small Dragon
250047_26_a
Grrraaaawr!
Amayori
250047_25_a
It's okay, Alice. I think they're
just taking their child home!
Eugeo
250047_24_a
Hmph!
Alice
250047_23_a
GRAAAWWRRRR!
Dragon
250047_22_a
Grrrr...
Dragon
250047_21_a
L-Like this, perhaps?
Alice
250047_20_a
Perhaps they're telling us to
return their child?
Eugeo
250047_19_a
They've settled down...
Eugeo
250047_18_a
Such as...?
Alice
250047_17_a
Graaaawr...
Dragon
250047_16_a
Chirp! Chirp!
Small Dragon
250047_15_a
If asking nicely didn't do
anything, I hardly think
shouting will help...
Eugeo
250047_14_a
Is this how you treat those who
mean to help you?!
Alice
250047_13_a
We have come to return the child
that you have lost!
Alice
250047_12_a
Calm yourselves, you beasts!
We are not here to steal your
child or attack your home!
Alice
250047_11_a
Well, this is a tight spot...
Do you suppose begging them to
stop would accomplish anything?
Eugeo
250047_10_a
GRAAAAH!!
Dragon
250047_9_a
Urk! Has it mistaken us for
kidnappers?!
Alice
250047_8_a
Gyah, look out! It's attacking!
Eugeo
250047_7_a
GRAAAAAAAAH!!
Dragon
250047_6_a
And you were correct, we weren't
too far away from
what in blazes?!
Eugeo
250047_5_a
Th-That is quite the multitude!
Alice
250047_4_a
Eugeo
250047_3_a
Alice
250047_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_fog
GRAAAWWRRRR!
Dragon Flock
250047_1_a
Graaaarrrrrrr!
Amayori
250045_19_a
Gyah! Alice, over there!
Eugeo
250045_18_a
What is it, little one?
Alice
250045_17_a
Chirp chirp!
Small Dragon
250045_16_a
I see...
Eugeo
250045_15_a
I believe we are duty-bound to
fight using the power granted
to us!
Alice
250045_14_a
...Have you no respect for your
station as an Integrity Knight?
Alice
250045_13_a
Besides, I think it's a really
useful and versatile technique.
Eugeo
250045_12_a
Well, I certainly wouldn't object.
Eugeo
250045_11_a
Still fixated on that technique,
are you? Do you intend that I
should join you in mastering it?
Alice
250045_10_a
She said they must be in lockstep
with one another and shut out all
other distractions to pull it off.
Eugeo
250045_9_a
...
Alice
250045_8_a
Which reminds me! Asuna's
technique only works if the people
executing it share a strong bond.
Eugeo
250045_7_a
Perhaps dragons share a bond that
transcends worlds.
Alice
250045_6_a
Ha ha, well, it certainly didn't
take long for them to become
friends!
Eugeo
250045_5_a
Chirp chirp!
Amayori
250045_4_a
Alice
250045_3_a
Eugeo
250045_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_fog
Chirp!
Small Dragon
250045_1_a
Graaauu!
Amayori
250043_23_a
Chirp chirp!
Small Dragon
250043_22_a
Agreed.
Alice
250043_21_a
We should reunite them as soon as
possible.
Eugeo
250043_20_a
Then the rest must be nearby.
Alice
250043_19_a
Now that you mention it, we're
quite close to the valley of
dragons listed on Kirito's map.
Eugeo
250043_18_a
So it does. But what is it doing
out here on its own? Has it
been separated from its horde?
Alice
250043_17_a
Though this one appears to be
even younger.
Eugeo
250043_16_a
It's quite cute! It reminds me of
Pina, the little dragon Kirito's
friend Silica owns.
Eugeo
250043_15_a
Graaauu!
Amayori
250043_14_a
A tiny dragon... So Amayori was
attempting to inform us of her
discovery.
Alice
250043_13_a
Chirp...
Small Dragon
250043_12_a
Alice, look!
Eugeo
250043_11_a
That sound...
Alice
250043_10_a
Eugeo
250043_9_a
Alice
250043_8_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_fog
Chirp...
???
250043_7_a
Then we shall investigate!
Alice
250043_6_a
Something in the forest below
keeps drawing Amayori's attention.
Eugeo
250043_5_a
What's wrong, Amayori?
Alice
250043_4_a
Eugeo
250043_3_a
Alice
250043_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
Grarrrrr...!
Amayori
250043_1_a
...
Alice
250041_21_a
Gyah! Hey now, I was just kidding!
Don't try to shake me off!
Eugeo
250041_20_a
I, however, shall not be deterred!
Alice
250041_19_a
Then dismount Amayori at once
and run back to the log cabin.
Alice
250041_18_a
Sure, but...
Okay, I'll admit it. I'd like
to learn that technique.
Eugeo
250041_17_a
The Goddess Stacia has already
endowed us with powers beyond
measure.
Alice
250041_16_a
But we, as Integrity Knights,
have no need for such things.
Alice
250041_15_a
...I know this technique you
speak of.
Alice
250041_14_a
The Divine Objects are but one
part of fighting the Forces of
Darkness. We could use more help.
Eugeo
250041_13_a
A technique that requires two
people to execute. Maybe we
should learn it too.
Eugeo
250041_12_a
I heard that Asuna and her crew
have learned a new technique.
Eugeo
250041_11_a
Such as...?
Alice
250041_10_a
Look, don't you think we should be
trying things that might help us
down the road instead?
Eugeo
250041_9_a
And by the same token, they have
vastly improved by virtue of us
having left home at all.
Alice
250041_8_a
Besides, our chances of simply
stumbling upon it in this massive
world seem rather remote to me.
Eugeo
250041_7_a
You say that as if we've found
even the slightest of clues...
Eugeo
250041_6_a
Eugeo, it would behoove you to
focus more of your attention on
our search for the Divine Objects.
Alice
250041_5_a
Whoa! Who knew there was such a
huge waterfall up in the mountains?
This is beautiful.
Eugeo
250041_4_a
...
Alice
250041_3_a
Alice
250041_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
Looks like there's a village off
that way.
Eugeo
250041_1_a
Yeah! I can't wait!
Yuuki
250028_50_a
Would you expect anything else
from a natural? Now you and I
have to give it a shot!
Kirito
250028_49_a
Heh heh heh...
Yuuki
250028_48_a
I just can't believe that you
executed the technique on your
first try
as a main and a sub!
Asuna
250028_47_a
Oh, don't worry about it.
We survived!
Asuna
250028_46_a
Sorry for taking control of,
uh...everything back there.
Yuuki
250028_45_a
Hah, yeah, I was laser-focused.
I'm just glad it worked!
Yuuki
250028_44_a
Yeah...
Man, you crushed it, Yuuki!
Kirito
250028_43_a
We should get back to the safe
zone while we can.
Asuna
250028_42_a
Yeah, but I'm sure those monsters
will come back sooner or later.
Asuna
250028_41_a
Asuna
250028_40_a
Yuuki
250028_39_a
Whew... Well, that turned out
all right in the end, eh?
Kirito
250028_38_a
GROAAAAAAARRRRRGH!
Minotaur
250028_37_a
Take one step back...
Then in for the attaaaaaack!
Yuuki
250028_36_a
YAAAAAAH!
Asuna
250028_35_a
Asuna! Switch!
Yuuki
250028_34_a
GRUGH!
Minotaur
250028_33_a
Here goes nothing!
AAAAHHHHHHH!
Yuuki
250028_32_a
Kirito
250028_31_a
I was born ready!
Asuna
250028_30_a
Heh, no problem. Do
what you've gotta do!
Kirito
250028_29_a
Kirito
250028_28_a
Sorry to leave you half-healed,
Kirito...
Asuna
250028_27_a
I saw how they moved! I know
I can pull it off!
Yuuki
250028_26_a
Kirito
250028_25_a
...
Asuna
250028_24_a
I'll give up if it fails!
I promise!
Yuuki
250028_23_a
You guys have to let me try the
technique! Just once!
Yuuki
250028_22_a
Asuna
250028_21_a
Yuuki...!
Kirito
250028_20_a
They can do something I can't,
and I'm not gonna let 'em get
away with it!
Yuuki
250028_19_a
Kirito
250028_18_a
Don't push yourself!
Asuna
250028_17_a
N-No! I can still do this!
Yuuki
250028_16_a
Kirito
250028_15_a
Just get back to the safe zone!
Asuna
250028_14_a
Kirito
250028_13_a
Yuuki, stop! You can't handle both
of them on your own!
Asuna
250028_12_a
Hngh!
Yuuki
250028_11_a
GROOOAAAAR!
Minotaur
250028_10_a
YAAAAH!
Yuuki
250028_9_a
Asuna
250028_8_a
Kirito
250028_7_a
I'll hold them back!
Yuuki
250028_6_a
They're attacking again!
I can't heal him in time!
Asuna
250028_5_a
Asuna
250028_4_a
Yuuki
250028_3_a
Kirito
250028_2_a
bg_event_field
GRAAARH!
Minotaur
250028_1_a
...
Yuuki
250027_29_a
T-Totally... I knew they could
cooperate, but not like that.
Kirito
250027_28_a
They just used Asuna's technique,
didn't they?
Yuuki
250027_27_a
I'll use some healing magic,
but it might be a while before
you can get up again.
Asuna
250027_26_a
Augh, I'm wondering that myself...
That really hurt...
Kirito
250027_25_a
Are you okay?!
Yuuki
250027_24_a
Kirito! No!
Asuna
250027_23_a
UNGH!
Kirito
250027_22_a
GROOOOOWRRR!
Minotaur B
250027_21_a
GRAAAAAHHHH!
Minotaur A
250027_20_a
N-No way! That looks like
Yuuki
250027_19_a
One stepped back, and...
the other's stepping forward!
Asuna
250027_18_a
GRUH!
Minotaur B
250027_17_a
GRAH!
Minotaur A
250027_16_a
Wait... What're they doing?
Kirito
250027_15_a
Oh crap!
Kirito
250027_14_a
It's coming for you, Kirito!
Yuuki
250027_13_a
ROAAAAAAR!
Minotaur A
250027_12_a
That's for sure...
Asuna
250027_11_a
Well, those guys are created by
the Divine Object's curse. No one
said they'd be pushovers!
Kirito
250027_10_a
I'd love to, but there aren't
any openings!
Asuna
250027_9_a
So let's use a little cooperation
of our own!
Yuuki
250027_8_a
Yuuki
250027_7_a
I knew they'd work together!
Asuna
250027_6_a
It blocked me!
Kirito
250027_5_a
NRRRAAAAWRRR!
Minotaur A
250027_4_a
Yuuki
250027_3_a
Asuna
250027_2_a
bg_event_field
I've got an opening!
Hrrraaagh!
Kirito
250027_1_a
Come on, you two, let's move!
Asuna
250025_24_a
Heh, I only smiled 'cause you did!
Yuuki
250025_23_a
She says, smiling from ear to ear!
Kirito
250025_22_a
Huh... They sound pretty tough!
Yuuki
250025_21_a
They watch our moves and try
to shield one another from our
attacks!
Asuna
250025_20_a
Yes! One attacks with physical
damage and the other uses magic!
Asuna
250025_19_a
I don't like the sound of that...
Yuuki
250025_18_a
You mean like the pair that teamed
up on us in Thrymheim?
Kirito
250025_17_a
Yeah... Two minotaurs!
Asuna
250025_16_a
Just two this time?
Yuuki
250025_15_a
Here they come!
Huh?
Kirito
250025_14_a
GWAAAAAR!
Monster
250025_13_a
I guess I'll have to pass on
practicing the technique for now.
Yuuki
250025_12_a
True... The next monsters will
be even more powerful, huh?
Yuuki
250025_11_a
You've pretty much lost any chance
of practicing it, though.
Asuna
250025_10_a
Yeah, that technique is a real
lifesaver.
Yuuki
250025_9_a
You've got that right.
But we can still take them.
Kirito
250025_8_a
Yep. They're getting pretty tough!
Yuuki
250025_7_a
I kind of lost count...
Was that the tenth wave?
Asuna
250025_6_a
Yuuki
250025_5_a
Asuna
250025_4_a
That was the last of this wave.
Let's heal up before the next one.
Kirito
250025_3_a
GYAAAARGH!
Monster
250025_2_a
bg_event_field
YAAAH!
Yuuki
250025_1_a
sigh
... How did it come to this?
Asuna
250023_23_a
Bring it, you ugly beast!
Yuuki
250023_22_a
Well, that didn't take long!
Kirito
250023_21_a
GROOOAAAARRR!
Monster
250023_20_a
Right behind you!
Kirito
250023_19_a
Alright, you two, let's go!
Asuna
250023_18_a
If, and only if,
we find an opening!
Asuna
250023_17_a
Let's give it a shot if we find
an opening!
Yuuki
250023_16_a
Heh heh...maybe?
But I'm on the same page now!
Yuuki
250023_15_a
...that you're just focusing on
practicing the technique on them?
Asuna
250023_14_a
Wow, are you so obsessed with
finding out how strong these
monsters will get...
Asuna
250023_13_a
Oh, right. We haven't...
Yuuki
250023_12_a
Hm, I guess we haven't tried me
as main and Yuuki as sub either,
huh?
Kirito
250023_11_a
I never got to see if I could
trigger the technique as a main.
Yuuki
250023_10_a
Aww, kind of a shame, don't
you think?
Yuuki
250023_9_a
Kirito and I will use our combo
technique if things go sideways!
Asuna
250023_8_a
Oh, and don't even think about
trying to play the hero, Yuuki.
Asuna
250023_7_a
And we'll head for the safe zone
at the first sign of trouble!
Asuna
250023_6_a
What she said!
Kirito
250023_5_a
I was born ready!
Yuuki
250023_4_a
Kirito
250023_3_a
Yuuki
250023_2_a
bg_event_field
Okay, just one quick trial!
Asuna
250023_1_a
You bloodthirsty little punks...!
Asuna
250021_20_a
Hehe, see? Kirito knows what
I'm talking about!
Yuuki
250021_19_a
What the
Asuna
250021_18_a
It...could actually be pretty fun.
Kirito
250021_17_a
Aren't you going to talk some
sense into her, Kirito?
Asuna
250021_16_a
Ugh, you and your adrenaline
addiction, always picking the
path of most resistance!
Asuna
250021_15_a
Yeah, but once you get that item,
you'll never go anywhere without
it! You'll get soft!
Yuuki
250021_14_a
We'll have plenty of opportunities
to try it once we get Liz's item!
Asuna
250021_13_a
All the more reason to give it a
shot, I say!
Yuuki
250021_12_a
Are you serious, Yuuki?
That's insane!
Asuna
250021_11_a
Well, shouldn't we give it a shot
before you go taking Liz's item?
Yuuki
250021_10_a
Yeah, I get that feeling too.
Kirito
250021_9_a
This could just be me, but doesn't
it seem like each monster that
spawns is stronger than the last?
Asuna
250021_8_a
Um, I guess we won't know until
we try, but...
Kirito
250021_7_a
What happens if you just let it
keep spawning monsters?
Yuuki
250021_6_a
So, like, that Divine Object is
cursed to just keep spawning
monsters, right?
Yuuki
250021_5_a
What's up?
Kirito
250021_4_a
Asuna
250021_3_a
Kirito
250021_2_a
bg_02_fountain
Actually, can I ask a question?
Yuuki
250021_1_a
You got it!
Sinon
250018_19_a
Let's work hard to make it even
better!
Leafa
250018_18_a
Hehe, yeah, that was an unexpected
twist. Now we'll have to try it
against some stronger foes!
Leafa
250018_17_a
Yeah, that did set the wheels in
motion. Who knew I'd end up
partnering with you?
Sinon
250018_16_a
No, I owe you so much! I'm so
glad I asked you for help!
Leafa
250018_15_a
So I'm happy you convinced me
to stick it out.
Sinon
250018_14_a
I know I came up with the idea,
but I didn't really think it was
possible.
Sinon
250018_13_a
Heh, thanks to your hard work.
Sinon
250018_12_a
I can't believe we managed to pull
it off!
Leafa
250018_11_a
And then explode into that monster
for incredible damage!
Sinon
250018_10_a
And I saw it! Our attacks
seemed to meld together...
Sinon
250018_9_a
I...did it?
I DID IT! WOOHOO!
Leafa
250018_8_a
Grraaargh!!
Monster
250018_7_a
I got this. I GOT THIS!
Leafa
250018_6_a
Eat arrow!
Sinon
250018_5_a
Sinon, now!
Leafa
250018_4_a
Graaawr!!
Monster
250018_3_a
Sinon
250018_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
Hraaagh!!
Leafa
250018_1_a
Yeah!
Leafa
250017_17_a
I guess I was worrying too much.
Let's get back to work.
Sinon
250017_16_a
Ha ha, I'm glad to hear it.
Sinon
250017_15_a
So in short...I'm super pumped
right now!
Leafa
250017_14_a
No apologies needed! Actually,
I get the feeling that if I can do
this, I'll get waaay stronger!
Leafa
250017_13_a
I think my wild idea ended up
making a lot of trouble for you.
Sinon
250017_12_a
Leafa... I'm sorry.
Sinon
250017_11_a
N-No, I can do it! In fact, only
someone as fast as me even
has a chance!
Leafa
250017_10_a
But fast enough to outrace an
arrow? I don't know what I was
thinking when I suggested this.
Sinon
250017_9_a
I think this was a bad idea.
I know you're incredibly fast...
Sinon
250017_8_a
Hehe... I blew it again...
Leafa
250017_7_a
Leafa! Are you okay?!
Sinon
250017_6_a
Urk!
Leafa
250017_5_a
I just have to try to match her
arrow's speed, and...STRIKE!!
Leafa
250017_4_a
I'm firing!
Sinon
250017_3_a
Sinon
250017_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Sinon!
Leafa
250017_1_a
Glad to hear you're up for it,
Leafa. Let's do this.
Sinon
250015_26_a
I absolutely cannot WAIT to start
practicing!
Leafa
250015_25_a
Hehehe... It sounds like a lot of
fun! You can count me in!
Leafa
250015_24_a
Exactly. Only someone far faster
than your average swordsman
could pull this one off.
Sinon
250015_23_a
Then I use a sword skill right
when and where your arrow hits?
Leafa
250015_22_a
Huh... So I attack to knock the
enemy off balance, then dodge
back so you have a clear shot...
Leafa
250015_21_a
So as long as we aim to hit the
same target at the same time,
it should work.
Sinon
250015_20_a
But really, it's less about the
switch and more about attacking
simultaneously for huge damage.
Sinon
250015_19_a
That's what I thought at first.
Sinon
250015_18_a
Umm, Sinon? Isn't this technique
strictly melee weapons only?
Leafa
250015_17_a
No. I'll use my bow. I'm not bad
with a spear, but I'm way better
with a bow.
Sinon
250015_16_a
But you use a bow and-
Oooh, you mean you'll use
your spear?
Leafa
250015_15_a
Wait, you want to partner with
me?!
Leafa
250015_14_a
How about partnering up with me?
Sinon
250015_13_a
Y-Yeah? About what?
Leafa
250015_12_a
Hey, Leafa? I've been thinking...
Sinon
250015_11_a
Sinon? Everything okay?
Leafa
250015_10_a
...
Sinon
250015_9_a
Sinon
250015_8_a
bg_event_alne_field
Phew... So Sinon, how was that?
It felt pretty good to me!
Leafa
250015_7_a
...
Sinon
250015_6_a
Groooaaarrrk!!
Monster
250015_5_a
You call that a dodge? Hah!!
Leafa
250015_4_a
Grrraaak!!
Monster
250015_3_a
Sinon
250015_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Annnd WHAM!
Leafa
250015_1_a
With pleasure.
Sinon
250013_19_a
Anyway! Training without a partner
isn't the best, but I'll make do.
So keep the comments flowing!
Leafa
250013_18_a
Hehe, yeah. I bet she'd love that.
Sinon
250013_17_a
I think you need to pick a steady
partner for this, so I'd like to
let her practice with Asuna.
Leafa
250013_16_a
Good point. She probably does.
Sinon
250013_15_a
But I think she probably wants to
team up with Asuna.
Leafa
250013_14_a
Yuuki? Well, she is pretty fast...
Leafa
250013_13_a
Hey, what about Yuuki?
Sinon
250013_12_a
Well, in that case, it's going to
be really hard to find you a
partner.
Sinon
250013_11_a
Yup! And especially me! Nobody can
beat me when it comes to flying!
Leafa
250013_10_a
That makes sense. So ALO players
generally have higher agility?
Sinon
250013_9_a
That's because ALO has flight.
Agility is way more important in
the air than it is on the ground.
Leafa
250013_8_a
I heard that those two had some of
the highest agility scores in SAO.
So if you're beating them...wow.
Sinon
250013_7_a
Just in terms of speed, you're
much faster than Kirito or Asuna.
Sinon
250013_6_a
You were incredible. At the very
least, on the same level as Kirito.
Sinon
250013_5_a
Phew... So, how did I do, Sinon?
Leafa
250013_4_a
Grrrnnnk!!
Monster
250013_3_a
Sinon
250013_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
Hyaaah!
Rrraaagggh!!
Leafa
250013_1_a
If you notice anything, just let
me know!
Leafa
250011_21_a
Really? Thanks a ton, Sinon!
Leafa
250011_20_a
I guess you can still train
without a partner. So anyway,
sure. I'll help you practice.
Sinon
250011_19_a
Hehe... No, not really...
Leafa
250011_18_a
In other words, you don't have
a "super switch" partner yet.
Sinon
250011_17_a
Well, I think I'm too fast for
them. We'd have too much
trouble matching our speeds.
Leafa
250011_16_a
No, that's not it. I don't want to
brag, but I have extremely high
agility, right?
Leafa
250011_15_a
Hmm. Is what's really bugging you
the fact that they didn't invite
you to practice with them?
Sinon
250011_14_a
That's right. As the ALO veteran
here, it kinda bugs me that he
got it before me...
Leafa
250011_13_a
I heard that after a bunch of
one-on-one lessons with Asuna,
Kirito finally figured it out.
Sinon
250011_12_a
Ah, that advanced version of
the switch.
Sinon
250011_11_a
To, uh...work on Asuna's
technique...
Leafa
250011_10_a
I don't think eyesight's the issue
here, but sure. Why are you
practicing so hard today, anyway?
Sinon
250011_9_a
You totally will! Your Cait Sith
eyes are sharp enough to catch
any slipups I make!
Leafa
250011_8_a
I don't mind, but I'm not a
swordswoman. I doubt I'll be
of much help.
Sinon
250011_7_a
I'm worried my sword thrust form
is off. Can you take a look and
give me some tips?
Leafa
250011_6_a
I did?
Sinon
250011_5_a
Oh, hey Sinon! You came at just
the right time!
Leafa
250011_4_a
You're certainly fired up today,
Leafa.
Sinon
250011_3_a
Sinon
250011_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Haaah!
Hyaaah!
Leafa
250011_1_a
With pleasure.
Alice
240448_27_a
Alice
240448_26_a
Eep! We got yelled at... Alright,
let's keep looking for shells.
Asuna
240448_25_a
Heeeey! No fraternizing
during the contest!
Yuuki
240448_24_a
Asuna
240448_23_a
Indeed...
Alice
240448_22_a
Sure, why not! There are lots
them here, after all.
Asuna
240448_21_a
May I take this one back with me?
Alice
240448_20_a
Strong as armor, yet lovely as
gems, and inside they hold the
sound of the ocean.
Alice
240448_19_a
Shells are...
such curious things.
Alice
240448_18_a
...
Alice
240448_17_a
When I hear the sea in a shell,
that's what the sound means to me.
Asuna
240448_16_a
Coming to the ocean reminds me
of being a kid, collecting shells
and listening to them...
Asuna
240448_15_a
Ha ha! I don't know about that.
But when I was little, I was
obsessed with these things.
Asuna
240448_14_a
Could this be using
the Sacred Arts...?
Alice
240448_13_a
Isn't that neat?
You can hear waves.
Asuna
240448_12_a
It's...the sound of the sea?!
Alice
240448_11_a
...!
Alice
240448_10_a
...
Alice
240448_9_a
Much obliged...
Alice
240448_8_a
Just try it!
Asuna
240448_7_a
Hm? What would that accomplish?
Alice
240448_6_a
Oh, by the way! You should try
putting this shell to your ear!
Asuna
240448_5_a
Hehe! Now you mention it, it does
look like that, doesn't it?
Asuna
240448_4_a
Quite the regal suit of armor...
Alice
240448_3_a
Asuna
240448_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Now, this shell... It's no beauty,
but it looks sturdy.
Alice
240448_1_a
Ready, set, go!
Yuuki
240447_31_a
I like your idea too, Alice.
Let's do that.
Asuna
240447_30_a
Yeah! That'd be cool! I'm in!
Yuuki
240447_29_a
Namely, the one who finds
the prettiest shell wins.
Alice
240447_28_a
Hm?
Asuna
240447_27_a
Rather than collecting the most...
might I suggest a contest for the
most beautiful?
Alice
240447_26_a
Hehe!
Yuuki
240447_25_a
Ha ha! Why's everything got to
be a competition with you?
Asuna
240447_24_a
Whoever gets the
most seashells wins!
Yuuki
240447_23_a
Aw yeah! Let's make it a contest!
Yuuki
240447_22_a
Good idea! I loved doing
that when I was little...
Asuna
240447_21_a
Let's collect some shells
to take home!
Yuuki
240447_20_a
...Hey, I got it!
Yuuki
240447_19_a
Covering the sand like gems from
an upturned treasure chest...
What a mysterious place.
Alice
240447_18_a
It's hard to imagine so
many different creatures.
Alice
240447_17_a
So many shells... I knew the waters
were full of living things, but...
Alice
240447_16_a
Look, this one's smaller.
Asuna
240447_15_a
That's right, Alice. There are
lots of different creatures'
shells here.
Asuna
240447_14_a
Armor?! Ha ha! Yeah, I guess
you could call it that!
Yuuki
240447_13_a
Sea...shells...? Ah! This must
be armor for those sea creatures
we ate earlier.
Alice
240447_12_a
Those? Oh!
They're seashells.
Asuna
240447_11_a
Asuna, Yuuki. What are these
strange gems in the sand?
Alice
240447_10_a
...Alice?
Asuna
240447_9_a
...
Alice
240447_8_a
What about you, Alice?
Asuna
240447_7_a
Ha ha... You sure have
a lot of energy, Yuuki.
Asuna
240447_6_a
Alright! I think I'm gonna
go hit the waves!
Yuuki
240447_5_a
Me too. I'm gonna rest a bit...
Asuna
240447_4_a
Alice
240447_3_a
Asuna
240447_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Phew! I'm stuffed.
Yuuki
240447_1_a
...
Alice
240445_23_a
Hehe, just teasing! We're glad
you like it.
Asuna
240445_22_a
I-I didn't mean-
Alice
240445_21_a
Don't worry about it! It's great
that you enjoy the local food
with such gusto!
Asuna
240445_20_a
A-Allow me to pay. I can use these
coins obtained from defeating the
Forces of Darkness, can I not?
Alice
240445_19_a
I-It's not a problem!
They were cheap, so we
can just buy some more!
Asuna
240445_18_a
Ehehe... Well...
Yuuki
240445_17_a
O-Oh dear... Were these comfort
foods intended for all of us to
share?
Alice
240445_16_a
Oh...
Alice
240445_15_a
Overall, a very pleasant dish.
And the next course...
Alice
240445_14_a
I see why Asuna calls
this food "addictive."
Alice
240445_13_a
Delightful... The richness of the
meat and veggies perfectly balances
the spices.
Alice
240445_12_a
chew chew
Alice
240445_11_a
Next we have this "curry"...
Alice
240445_10_a
Very well, then.
I'll set the bowl aside.
Alice
240445_9_a
Er... I can't usually finish all
of it. It's too heavy...
Asuna
240445_8_a
Am I supposed to drink the
remainder of the soup?
Alice
240445_7_a
Wow... She must've been hungry.
Yuuki
240445_6_a

Alice
240443_25_a
slurp slurp
Alice
240443_24_a
Much obliged...
Alice
240443_23_a
Here, Alice! Have a
taste of the ramen!
Yuuki
240443_22_a
Ha ha! Yes, that's it.
Asuna
240443_21_a
So...in other words, these are
foods one shouldn't overindulge
in, correct?
Alice
240443_20_a
I mean, h-here at the beach! Since
this is a special occasion, right?
Hehe...
Asuna
240443_19_a
...!
Alice
240443_18_a
I guess it doesn't matter what
we eat in this world, though...
Asuna
240443_17_a
Eh, you got me there...
Yuuki
240443_16_a
Really? Well, I guess there's a
first time for everything! Hehe!
Asuna
240443_15_a
You're gonna make
me lose my appetite.
Yuuki
240443_14_a
Yeesh, Asuna!
Lighten up a little!
Yuuki
240443_13_a
It means something so
tasty it's addictive, but
loaded with fat and carbs...
Asuna
240443_12_a
What is "comfort food"?
Alice
240443_11_a
In other words, "comfort food"!
Asuna
240443_10_a
And that delicious aroma comes
from these fried noodles with
meat and veggies called "yakisoba."
Yuuki
240443_9_a
The brown stew-like dish with
rice on the side is called "curry"...
Yuuki
240443_8_a
Let me fill you in, then!
This soup with noodles
in it is called "ramen"...
Yuuki
240443_7_a
These are all...quite different
from any foods I'm familiar with.
Alice
240443_6_a
It's all good! This way
can all share it!
Yuuki
240443_5_a
Whoa, Yuuki!
How much did you buy?
Asuna
240443_4_a
Alice

Now THIS is the taste of a
summer day at the beach!
Yuuki

...
Alice
240441_19_a
Hehe! Sounds good to me!
Asuna
240441_18_a
Let's leave the boys to do their
thing while we hit up the
beach house!
Yuuki
240441_17_a
I've got an idea! Why don't we
go get something to eat? I'm
starving.
Yuuki
240441_16_a
Once the goddess is appeased,
I can focus on finding a way to
return to the Central Cathedral...
Alice
240441_15_a
That won't be necessary. I mustn't
lose sight of my mission.
Alice
240441_14_a
That...
Alice
240441_13_a
Why not take this time to catch up
on some relaxation yourself?
Asuna
240441_12_a
We'll be here until Amayori's
feeling better, Alice.
Asuna
240441_11_a
You can say that again. You guys
sure have been through a lot.
Yuuki
240441_10_a
What a long journey it has been.
Alice
240441_9_a
Standing before the vastness
of this ocean, I finally felt it
settle in my heart...
Alice
240441_8_a
Suddenly finding myself in this
world, being sent out to search
for the Objects with you all...
Alice
240441_7_a
Not as such... I was just
taking a moment to reflect
on all that's happened lately.
Alice
240441_6_a
Still tired out from battle, huh?
Yuuki
240441_5_a
What's wrong, Alice?

Thanks, guys! Now let's get these
pirates into tip-top fighting
shape for the next battle!
Leafa
240438_30_a
Asuna
240438_29_a
We've got your back from
here on out, too.
Sinon
240438_28_a
Kirito
240438_27_a
Hehe, thanks for the compliment...
Leafa
240438_26_a
Teaching isn't easy, not by a long
shot. And I can't imagine pirates
make for the best students.
Asuna
240438_25_a
Sinon
240438_24_a
I'm really impressed with how
serious you are about training
the crew.
Asuna
240438_23_a
Ha ha, that's the spirit.
Spoken like a true swordmaster!
Kirito
240438_22_a
And now that they're soft clay in
my hands again, I'll be sure to
mold them right!
Leafa
240438_21_a
Kirito
240438_20_a
Yeah, we needed drastic measures.
Unlearning things is hard,
even for us humans.
Leafa
240438_19_a
You were right: this mock battle
was just what the doctor ordered!
Asuna
240438_18_a
Asuna
240438_17_a
Heh heh! They're even learning
how to evade projectiles.
Sinon
240438_16_a
Aye-aye, cap'n!!
Crew Members
240438_15_a
Arrows incoming! Scatter, boys!
Crew A
240438_14_a
Kirito
240438_13_a
Look out!
That archer's aiming for you!
Leafa
240438_12_a
But see if you can handle this!
Sinon
240438_11_a
All right!
I knew the battle AI would get
the hint eventually!
Kirito
240438_9_a
Leafa
240438_10_a
Kirito
240438_8_a
It's working! They're getting the
hang of it!
Leafa
240438_7_a
Ooo, not a bad dodge!
Kirito
240438_6_a
Ah! You backstabbin' swine!
Crew A
240438_5_a
Haaah!
Kirito
240438_4_a
You there! Watch your back!
Leafa
240438_3_a
Leafa
240438_2_a
bg_event_pirate_ship
Take THIS!
Crew A
240438_1_a
So it's not life or death,
but the stakes are still high...
Yes! That's just what we need!
Leafa
240437_35_a
We fight them, and don't pull our
punches too much. A few bruises
might help 'em unlearn bad habits.
Kirito
240437_34_a
We could stage a mock melee battle
to help them learn how to fight
against multiple opponents.
Kirito
240437_33_a
Oh... Good idea!
Leafa
240437_32_a
How about we all pitch in?
I bet Asuna and the others
can help out too!
Kirito
240437_31_a
But yes, so far I've taken care
of it all myself.
Leafa
240437_30_a
Yeah. I've been mostly imitating
the way my teacher handles his
lessons.
Leafa
240437_29_a
You're the only one who's
been teaching them so far, right?
Kirito
240437_28_a
Hmm. In that case... Aha!
Kirito
240437_27_a
B-But what if they end up
sea monster chow without us?!
Leafa
240437_26_a
Maybe don't help them?
The pirates might figure out
they're leaving themselves open.
Kirito
240437_25_a
Yeah. Me and Asuna had to run
around keeping them alive.
Leafa
240437_24_a
Ouch... By the way, did the
pirates only fight monsters
one-on-one in that last battle?
Kirito
240437_23_a
But apparently it's really hard to
do, and there's zero hints on
how to do it.
Leafa
240437_22_a
Well, it's not like it's
completely impossible to change
their fighting style.
Leafa
240437_21_a
They are basic NPCs without
high-level AI. I guess we can't
expect that much from them.
Kirito
240437_20_a
Oh, right. So once a
pirate-kendomaster, always a
pirate-kendomaster.
Kirito
240437_19_a
And I picked kendo, not battle
tactics. I don't think it'll let
me just switch skill trees...
Leafa
240437_18_a
But the game only lets you choose
one skill to raise.
Leafa
240437_17_a
That's how it's done it in ALO.
Just teach them what you learned
in Alfheim.
Kirito
240437_16_a
But you can still teach them
how to fight in formation, right?
Kirito
240437_15_a
I feel like I did more harm than
good.
Leafa
240437_14_a
Heh, sorry...
Kirito
240437_13_a
Save it, Kazuto!
It's not funny!
Leafa
240437_12_a
Man, this is a really elaborate
raising sim...
Kirito
240437_11_a
You're worried that only knowing
kendo basics could get them hurt
in a real battle?
Kirito
240437_10_a
...I think I get it.
Kirito
240437_9_a
Oh! I-It's just...
sigh
Leafa
240437_8_a
What's wrong, Sugu?
You look pretty down.
Kirito
240437_7_a
...
Leafa
240437_6_a
Three, two, one!
HYAAAH!

Graaarrgh!
Monster
240435_23_a
Or... M-Maybe I focused too much
on basics, and not enough on
sparring?
Leafa
240435_22_a
he can't see what's going on
around him?
Asuna
240435_21_a
Maybe he's so focused on the
enemy in front of him,
Asuna
240435_20_a
H-Hey! I said, there's one behind
you! BEHIND YOU!
Turn around!
Leafa
240435_19_a
HIYAAAH!

Yeah!
I guess that training paid off!
Leafa

Wow! They're fighting way better
than they were last time!
And they're a lot stronger, too!
Asuna

Cawww!!

STRIKE!!

Wow! They sure are...enthusiastic.
Asuna

Aye-aye, swordmaster! Come on,
boys! Let's show Lady Leafa that
we've been paying attention!
Crew A
240435_8_a
Leave it to us! Ready, class?
Let's see your training pay off!
Leafa
240435_7_a
But how?
There's so many of them!
Asuna
240435_6_a
We need to defeat 'em all before
the ship is damaged!

Ah! The monsters made it onto the

discipline, I'm positive she'll
do fine.

Unless you want Davy Jones
for your next sensei!
Leafa
240433_19_a
...Unlike THIS slacker!
Yeah, you! Back to work!
Leafa
240433_18_a
Heh! I'll do my best!
Leafa
240433_17_a
You'll whip these pirates
into shape in no time!
Kirito
240433_16_a
I'm sure you are. I remember how
good of a kendo teacher you were
to me.
Kirito
240433_15_a
I've never done anything like this
before, so I just hope I'm doing
a good job.
Leafa
240433_14_a
Once I can get their stats up!
This training basically boils down
to a raising sim mechanic.
Leafa
240433_13_a
Wow... That's unusual.
So what's the verdict? Are pirates
and kendo a good match?
Kirito
240433_12_a
Neither did I! The game gave me a
bunch of different options, and
kendo was one of them.
Leafa
240433_11_a
But I never expected you to be
teaching pirates how to do kendo!
Kirito
240433_10_a
Yeah. Asuna said you were teaching
the crew how to fight.
Kirito
240433_9_a
Oh, hey Kazuto. Were you watching?
Leafa
240433_8_a
Wow, she's so strict...
Kirito
240433_7_a
Focus on your opponent's eyes!
The trick is to parry the move
they haven't made!
Leafa
240433_6_a
Aye-aye, cap'n!!
Crew
240433_5_a
Your feet are all over the place.

Blondie here's in charge of sword
drills from now on!
Captain
240431_15_a
Hehe, well...
I hope you're right.
But can I pull this off?
Leafa
240431_14_a
Just show them the basics. I
recommend starting with the "stick
them with the pointy end" level.
Asuna
240431_13_a
Don't worry, Leafa.
I'm sure he doesn't expect you to
lead kendo classes.
Asuna
240431_12_a
M-Me?! Swordmaster?! No way!
I wouldn't know where to begin!
Leafa
240431_11_a
Specially you, Blondie! Starting
now, you're our swordmaster! Teach
the lads how to swing a blade!
Captain
240431_10_a
Thanks, I guess.
Leafa
240431_9_a
You guys ain't half bad in a

Asuna

Your voice can be the light that
helps them out of the darkness...

with a heart full of sorrow or shaken
by fear and despair...

Oh come on! Drop the attitude...
Leafa
240418_13_a
Though I'm more confused about
why a pool would need a karaoke
studio...
Kirito
240418_12_a
Confused? Well, I guess
you could say that...
Kirito
240418_9_a
Asuna
240418_11_a
Silica
240418_10_a
Even if you seemed a little
confused about the reason
you were singing...
Yuna
240418_8_a
Wowie! That's a wonderful voice!
Yuna
240418_7_a
Silica

Kirito, bravo!
You sounded great!

Asuna
240417_53_a
Hahaha... Okay. I can't promise
anything, but I'll give it my best
shot.
Kirito
240417_52_a
Yuna's not going to be impressed
if you put on a performance like
that.
Sinon

240417_50_a
Leafa
240417_49_a
Kirito, you'd better show
a little more enthusiasm!
Sinon
240417_48_a
Uhm...
I guess I'll sing this one...
Kirito
240417_47_a
Silica
240417_46_a
Asuna
240417_45_a
O-Okay...
But just one song...
Kirito
240417_44_a
Besides, her advice is super useful!

240417_41_a
Me too! And it's not every day
you get vocal coaching from Yuna!
Leafa
240417_40_a
Rules are rules, Kirito! Besides,
I want to hear you sing!
Silica
240417_39_a
I'm having a great
time just listening...
Kirito
240417_38_a

You're up next, Kirito.

Kirito
240417_29_a
Oh, no, not at all, Liz!
You were REALLY good!
Asuna
240417_28_a
Hehehe... Though I do get the
feeling she just gave me a good
score because I was energetic.
Liz
240417_27_a
Sinon
240417_26_a
Liz
240417_25_a
Whoa! That's the best score yet!
Leafa
240417_24_a
That's why your score is...90!
Right on track to becoming a star!
Yuna
240417_23_a
Being able to sing passionately is
a fine skill for any singer to have!
Yuna
240417_22_a
Though that is certainly one way
to sing. It's never good to put
restrictions on yourself, after all.
Yuna

Leafa

It's a shame you were singing
slightly different melodies from
the original song in some places.

Leafa

I won't be told I was shy like
Asuna!

Yeah, that was some good advice...
Alright! My turn!

Kirito
240415_48_a
Unbelievable...
Every word she said is true!
Asuna
240415_47_a
I know you'll do great!
Your score is...85! See ya!
Yuna
240415_46_a
A little stage fright is normal,
but the more you sing, the
more fun you'll have!
Yuna
240415_45_a
Emotion is just as important
as technique for singing...
Maybe even more important!
Yuna

Silica
240415_43_a
Kirito
240415_42_a
...!
Asuna
240415_41_a
But...you seemed just a
teensy bit shy!
Yuna
240415_40_a
Wow, that was great!
You're a really good singer!
Your technique was perfect!
Yuna
240415_39_a
Silica
240415_38_a
Kirito

O-Okay... Let's see... Hmm,
which song should I pick...?
Asuna

Sinon
240415_35_a
Leafa
240415_34_a
Nope! No excuses! We all have to
sing, no hold-outs!

When I think about Yuna judging
me, I just get...nervous...
Asuna
240415_32_a
Silica
240415_31_a
Kirito
240415_30_a
Wh-What? M-Me?
No, I can go later!

You're up, Asuna!

Anyway, let's put in
the next song...
Liz
240415_25_a
Yeah! I'll remember her advice
and work hard on my singing!
Silica
240415_24_a
That Avatar-AI combined with the
grading system makes it feel like
Yuna's really here, doesn't it?
Kirito
240415_23_a
She picked up on everything.
Silica
240415_22_a
Asuna
240415_21_a
Kirito
240415_20_a
Y-Yeah... I guess I was so caught
up in the fun of singing that I
lost my breath a few times...
Silica
240415_19_a
Sinon
240415_18_a
Liz
240415_17_a
Wow... She went into a lot of
detail with the feedback.
Leafa
240415_16_a
I'm sure you'll sound even better!
Your score is...80! Bye-bye now!
Yuna
240415_15_a
Remember to breathe from your
diaphragm when you sing! If you
work on breath control...
Yuna
240415_14_a
But unfortunately, you sounded
a little out of breath there a
few times...
Yuna
240415_13_a
Sinon
240415_12_a
Leafa
240415_11_a
Whoa! I bet you got a high score!

Your pitch and rhythm were right
on point! Your delivery and stage
presence were great too!

Alright! I'm going

It's gotta be "Ubiquitous dB"!

Karaoke?! Who comes to
a pool to sing?!

I know! Isn't that neat!
But best of all...there's
KARAOKE!
Silica

Kirito

Silica
240411_11_a
And a bowling alley.

an arcade too.

Thanks, kid! Come on back soon!
Shopkeeper

Hehe, yeah. Doesn't seem like
there's much time for talking.
Shopkeeper
240408_21_a
Go on! You have a customer!

240408_20_a
I'd like one of these, please!
Player
240408_19_a
I'm glad to hear it.
Liz
240408_18_a
But my success here today's given
me a new lease on life! I'm ready
to double-shift it at my real job!
Shopkeeper
240408_17_a
Yeah. There's so much potential
in this world.
Shopkeeper
240408_16_a
We were able to redesign,
manufacture, and stock everything
in a single night!
Liz
240408_15_a
Hehe, and yet another perk of
VRMMOs!
Liz
240408_14_a
So I just want to say...thanks.
Shopkeeper
240408_13_a
Because of you, young people are
seeing and enjoying the things
I've made.
Shopkeeper
240408_12_a
Ha ha, and you're the one who
made it all possible.
Shopkeeper
240408_11_a
They're the ones who gave us
permission to recreate your wares
into festival-official merch.
Liz
240408_10_a
You can thank the management
for that.
Liz
240408_9_a
Well... I definitely didn't think
things would turn around this
quickly.
Shopkeeper

How's it going, Pops?

What is it?
Strea
240407_16_a
Hmm... Aha!
I just thought of something!
Liz
240407_15_a
Then all we have to do is make
ourselves unique, and that solves
the problem.
Liz
240407_14_a
On the other, you're just the
first in a sea of many, so people
are less likely to drop money.
Strea
240407_13_a
It's a double-edged sword.
On one hand, it does make you
highly visible.
Strea
240407_12_a
Wait, what?! Aren't people
fighting over a spot that good?
Liz
240407_11_a
Actually, there is one spot near
the entrance that's empty now.
Strea
240407_10_a
First off, the location's pretty
bad. Is there another open booth
space with more visibility?
Liz
240407_9_a
Well, I think the wares are great,
and they fit the event!
We just have to work on marketing!
Liz
240407_8_a
Not the greatest combination for
selling Japanese handicrafts.
Strea
240407_7_a
Like the shopkeeper said, ALO's
a Norse fantasy world,
and its player base is young.
Strea
240407_6_a
I think it's fine, as long as it's
just for a little bit. There
aren't any competing shops either.
Strea
240407_5_a
Now that I'm helping you run this
thing, people might see it as
favoritism.
Liz
240407_4_a
So, can I help him out?
I'm just worried it'd cause
problems later.
Liz
240407_3_a
Liz
240407_2_a
bg_event_festival
Ahh, that is a shame...
Strea
240407_1_a
Hehe, I'm only ALO's most beloved
blacksmith! Leave everything to
me!
Liz
240405_26_a
Uhh... But how? Who are you?
Shopkeeper
240405_25_a
I'll come up with a proposal!
I guarantee it'll up your
visibility and sales!
Liz
240405_24_a
I bet a lot of people don't even
know you're hidden back here in
this corner.
Liz
240405_23_a
I've got a few suggestions.
Let's start with location.
You could do better.
Liz
240405_22_a
Umm, sure? But what exactly?
Shopkeeper
240405_21_a
Would you mind if I tried
something to boost your business?
Liz
240405_20_a
...
Liz
240405_19_a
sigh
There's still a few days
of the festival left, but I'm
afraid I won't do much better...
Shopkeeper
240405_18_a
Anyway, I think I'll close up for
today.
Shopkeeper
240405_17_a
Ha ha, thanks for trying to
cheer me up.
Shopkeeper
240405_16_a
My parents got me a glass fish at
a place like this when I was
little, and I still have it!
Liz
240405_15_a
But it's not a summer festival
without one of these shops!
Liz
240405_14_a
Aww, I'm sorry to hear it...
Liz
240405_13_a
But it's the same story.
Not to mention my wares don't
exactly fit the ALO theme. Heh.
Shopkeeper
240405_12_a
But nothing's selling like it
used to. That's why I came over
here to try my luck.
Shopkeeper
240405_11_a
Nope. I sell these sorts of things
for a living in the real world,
too...
Shopkeeper
240405_10_a
Ah. Business not so good?
Liz
240405_9_a
I just wish more people agreed.
Shopkeeper
240405_8_a
Ha ha, thanks.
Shopkeeper
240405_7_a
I love all of the traditional
Japanese handicrafts you're
selling here!
Liz
240405_6_a
This place is great!

240405_5_a
Wind chimes, pinwheels, beautiful
hairpins...

Hey there, missy.
Shopkeeper

Hmm? Wait a minute...

bg_event_festival
So, that's the last of the booths.
Liz
240405_1_a
Where does she put it all...?

240403_22_a
I see. Well, if you will excuse
me... The candy apples are
half-off right now.
Premiere
240403_21_a
I'm good. I'm not that hungry,
actually.
Liz
240403_20_a
Would you like a bite, Liz?
Premiere
240403_19_a
Ha ha ha! You're going to get a
reputation carrying around all
that food.
Liz
240403_18_a
I thought it prudent to take
advantage, so I bought something
from every stall.
Premiere
240403_17_a
The shops have been selling them
at a much lower price this past
hour.
Premiere
240403_16_a
Soooooo... What are you doing with
all that food, anyway?
That's enough for ten people.
Liz
240403_15_a
Yep. That's why I'm looking
around. Thought it'd be a nice
way to end the day.
Liz
240403_14_a
Liz, have you completed your
duties?
Premiere
240403_13_a
H-Hof hourse...

mouth full.

Ah... 
munch munch
Mmphiz?
Premiere
240403_10_a
Hmm?
Liz
240403_9_a
Though they're mostly starting
to close down, like Strea said.
Liz
240403_8_a
There sure are a lot of food
stalls. I guess half the fun is
stuffing your face with junk.
Liz
240403_7_a
...

240403_6_a
All right. See you around!
Shopkeeper
240403_5_a
I just ate staff rations back at

Hmm... Maybe another time.

Hey! We're having a closing sale!
Care to look around?
Shopkeeper

Okay! Have fun!
Strea
240401_15_a
Great!
I'll go check out what's left.
Liz
240401_14_a
They should mostly be closing
up soon, but I'm sure SOMETHING
will be open!
Strea
240401_13_a
It's okay. You think any are
still open?
Liz
240401_12_a
Aw, sorry about that, Liz.
Strea
240401_11_a
I didn't even get to see the
booths!
Liz
240401_10_a
The behind-the-scenes work was
great, but...

240401_9_a
I just remembered that I came
here to enjoy the festival!

240401_8_a
What's wrong?
Strea
240401_7_a
You did such a good job! Even
Premiere was having a blast.
I'm so happy we- Wait!
Liz
240401_6_a
Nah. I'm just glad I was able
to help make ALO a fun place to
hang out.
Strea
240401_5_a
I was glad to help.
But you must be exhausted!
Liz
240401_4_a
Yeah! Thanks for all the help
running things, Liz!
Strea
240401_3_a
Strea
240401_2_a
bg_event_festival
Anyway, I think that's all the
scheduled events for the festival
today.
Liz
240401_1_a
Hehe, I'll do my best!
Yui
240398_21_a
Get your dad a reward this time!
Kirito
240398_20_a
Alright, Yui... Why don't you
go play one more time?
Kirito
240398_19_a
I guess they're splurging
because this is a family event.
Yui
240398_18_a
Whoa... The rewards for this
event are pretty good.
Kirito
240398_17_a
I'm just happy I was finally able
to participate in a battle!
Yui
240398_16_a
This quest was basically made
for you!
Kirito
240398_15_a
Yeah, I bet you're right. I'm
way too big to dart around
a playground like that.
Kirito
240398_14_a
Hehe, thank you! I bet even you
couldn't do this quest, Daddy!
Yui
240398_13_a
I enjoyed watching you dash
in and out of those small spaces
as you defeated the monsters.
Kirito
240398_12_a
I could tell.
Kirito
240398_11_a
Hehehe...
That was a lot of fun!
Yui
240398_10_a
Yui
240398_9_a
Good work out there, Yui.
Kirito
240398_8_a
Of course!
Yui
240398_7_a
Let's play again, Yui!
Child A
240398_6_a
It was a close fight, though.
Yui
240398_5_a
Aww, I lost again!!
Child B
240398_4_a
Thank you very much.
Yui
240398_3_a
Yui
240398_2_a
bg_os_town_2
Wow! You're amazing, Yui!
Child A
240398_1_a
You think so...?
Yui
240397_19_a
I bet you'd have a lot of fun
in that event!
Kirito
240397_18_a
Yes?
Yui
240397_17_a
Yui. I just had a thought...
Kirito
240397_16_a
Wait a minute...
Kirito
240397_15_a
I remember squeezing into the
narrow spaces and pretending
it was a secret base...
Kirito
240397_14_a
Ha ha, me and Sugu loved those
slides and jungle gyms when we
were kids too.
Kirito
240397_13_a
They're supposed to be most
concentrated around the playground
equipment.
Yui
240397_12_a
and the children fight them off.
Yui
240397_11_a
Apparently, cute little demons
are supposed to appear around
the playground,
Yui
240397_10_a
It makes sense that the devs
are having tie-up events at
kid-friendly spaces.
Kirito
240397_9_a
Hmm. Must be the result of OS
gaining a whole lot more players
recently.
Kirito
240397_8_a
It seems to be a mini-event for
children.
Yui
240397_7_a
Oh, you're right!
Let me get some info on it.
Yui
240397_6_a
Huh... It says it's an OS event.
Kirito
240397_5_a
All those kids look so excited.
Yui
240397_4_a
Yui
240397_3_a
Is there some kind of event
going on over there?
Kirito
240397_2_a
bg_os_town_2
chatter
240397_1_a
...
Kirito
240395_16_a
Okay...
Yui
240395_15_a
We should start heading home.
Kirito
240395_14_a
Okay...
Yui
240395_13_a
Anyway, that's enough for now.
Kirito
240395_12_a
D-Don't get so down, Yui.
You're always so helpful with
information gathering.
Kirito
240395_11_a
Which makes me useless in OS's
physically demanding battles...
Yui
240395_10_a
So...in this world, I can only
make the movements that a
child would...
Yui
240395_9_a
I think they limit NPCs' actions
so they don't exceed realistic
physical abilities for their bodies.
Kirito
240395_8_a
the game. Not to mention, it's
probably against the game's rules to bring
in characters like that.
Kirito
240395_7_a
They could be action heroes and
ninjas, or anything they wanted,
which would completely break
Kirito
240395_6_a
Imagine what it would do to this
game if NPCs could do crazy
things a normal person couldn't.
Kirito
240395_5_a
I mean, it's to be expected...
Kirito
240395_4_a
I couldn't do anything in that
fight...
Yui
240395_3_a
Kirito
240395_2_a
bg_os_town_1
sigh
...
Yui
240395_1_a
Oh...
Yui
240393_35_a
So, it's going to be impossible
for you to fight effectively in
battle...
Kirito
240393_34_a
The enemies in OS are balanced
around the average adult's
athletic ability.
Kirito
240393_33_a
In the real world, children and
adults have considerably different
physical capabilities.
Kirito
240393_32_a
Huh? What's wrong with that?
Yui
240393_31_a
...Man. You've only got the
physical abilities of the
average kid...
Kirito
240393_30_a
Like this...?
Yui
240393_29_a
O-Okay! Yah!
Yui
240393_28_a
Now jump as high as you can.
Kirito
240393_27_a
L-Like this?
Yui
240393_26_a
Good. Now, jog a little.
Kirito
240393_25_a
Like this?
Yui
240393_24_a
Uh... Okay, sure...
Yui
240393_23_a
Yui. Could you walk a little
for me?
Kirito
240393_22_a
What is it, Daddy?
Yui
240393_21_a
Wait a minute...
Kirito
240393_20_a
I figured as much. You don't
have anything equipped, and
you look just like a kid...
Kirito
240393_19_a
So...I guess your role isn't that
much different than what it is
in ALO.
Kirito
240393_18_a
You may be a child, but you have
a wealth of knowledge on Unital
for assisting the Adapts.
Kirito
240393_17_a
Uh... You're a navigator sent
to the Adapts by The Order...
Kirito
240393_16_a
It should say in your description
text...
Kirito
240393_15_a
Let's see what kind of cards OS
has dealt me.
Yui
240393_14_a
It's like when ALO automatically
converted me into a navigation
pixie when I first got there.
Yui
240393_13_a
I see what you mean.
Yui
240393_12_a
We should check to see what OS
turned you into.
Kirito
240393_11_a
According to OS lore, human
players are D-Tuner-compatible
Adapts.
Kirito
240393_10_a
I'm pretty sure you can, but
you ARE an NPC, Yui...
Kirito
240393_9_a
Now I can help you and Mommy
fight the DBAs!
Yui
240393_8_a
I'm happy for you, kiddo.
Kirito
240393_7_a
I can move in the real world in
human form, Daddy! I'm not a
fairy anymore!
Yui
240393_6_a
Just fine!
Yui
240393_5_a
How does it feel, Yui?
Kirito
240393_4_a
...
Yui
240393_3_a
Yui
240393_2_a
bg_15_kazuto_bedroom_morning
Alright, conversion is complete!
Kirito
240393_1_a
Of course!
Yui
240391_16_a
Could you give me a little time?
Kirito
240391_15_a
Okay. Then I'll try some things
when I log out.
Kirito
240391_14_a
Yes! I think I'd still be useful.
I want to help out!
Yui
240391_13_a
Is that okay?
Kirito
240391_12_a
For example, your movements
might be a little clunky if they
don't transfer well.
Kirito
240391_11_a
I see. I'll look into it. There
might be a lot of little
adjustments to make.
Kirito
240391_10_a
just like I do now in ALO.
Yui
240391_9_a
Yes. I'd like to help you and
Mommy fight in OS,
Yui
240391_8_a
Yui... Are you saying you'd like
to be a human avatar in OS?
Kirito
240391_7_a
Right...
Kirito
240391_6_a
but I'm a pixie when I play OS
with you guys in the real world.
Yui
240391_5_a
I know that I've been adjusted
so I can actually go into battle
in ALO,
Yui
240391_4_a
What is it, Yui?
Kirito
240391_3_a
Kirito
240391_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Daddy, I'd like to ask you a
favor.
Yui
240391_1_a
Ha ha, I'm glad to hear that.
Kirito
240388_28_a
Yeah! It seemed really happy!
Leafa
240388_27_a
I didn't hear anything. Did the
ram give you a final message
or something?
Kirito
240388_26_a
Thank you so much!
Leafa
240388_25_a
I hope for many happy days for
the both of you... Farewell.
Golden Ram
240388_24_a
I am proud that I was able
to help such caring siblings.
Golden Ram
240388_23_a
Can't you hear that?
It's the ram...!
Leafa
240388_22_a
What's wrong, Sugu?
Kirito
240388_21_a
Huh?
Leafa
240388_20_a
Ha ha...
???
240388_19_a
I-I guess...
Leafa
240388_18_a
See, I told you! You got that
reward because you did the
right thing!
Kirito
240388_17_a
item_event_capricorn_sword
I got a reward!
It's the Treasure of Aries!
Leafa
240388_16_a
It's the quest completion
notification... Nice!
Leafa
240388_15_a
What is it?
Kirito
240388_14_a
But... Huh?
Leafa
240388_13_a
I think so, at least.
Kirito
240388_12_a
It said it was happy for doing
the job it was sent to do. But
was it really...?
Leafa
240388_11_a
Didn't it tell you it's
returning to the gods, though?
Kirito
240388_10_a
I don't know about that. What
about the ram? It was taken
advantage of and killed.
Leafa
240388_9_a
This retelling had a happier
ending than the original,
didn't it?
Kirito
240388_8_a
...
Kirito
240388_7_a
Then, the two players escape
together. At least, that's what
I think the intent was.
Leafa
240388_6_a
One player risks his life to let
the other go, and the survivor
revives them afterwards.
Leafa
240388_5_a
Yep. I guess we figured it out.
Leafa
240388_4_a
I didn't think I'd get sent back
to you immediately after my HP
ran out.
Kirito
240388_3_a
Leafa
240388_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
So that's what this quest was
all about...
Kirito
240388_1_a
A-Alright... If you say so...
Thank you...
Leafa
240387_31_a
Go on. Say that you'll sacrifice
me. It will bring your brother
back.
Golden Ram
240387_30_a
But is that really true...?
Leafa
240387_29_a
The ram with the golden fleece
returns to the gods after being
sacrificed...
Leafa
240387_28_a
It does say that in the
original tale.
Leafa
240387_27_a
...
Leafa
240387_26_a
H-Hold up...
Leafa
240387_25_a
...!
Leafa
240387_24_a
It is my greatest honor and joy
to return to the gods after a
job well done.
Golden Ram
240387_23_a
...No need to worry about me.
Golden Ram
240387_22_a
A-Are you sure? But you're
going to die, just like in the
original story.
Leafa
240387_21_a
This will resurrect your brother.
I was sent by the gods for this
very purpose.
Golden Ram
240387_20_a
What?
Leafa
240387_19_a
There is a way out: offer me
as a sacrifice.
Golden Ram
240387_18_a
I don't want to experience that
ever again.
Leafa
240387_17_a
I know this is a game and he's
coming back...but I still sent
him to his death.
Leafa
240387_16_a
So, what? You expect me to be
happy? He sacrificed himself
for me!
Leafa
240387_15_a
You've lost your brother, the
prince. But this is no tragedy
he has protected you.
Golden Ram
240387_14_a
Wow...
Leafa
240387_13_a
Indeed, I am. I am speaking
directly into your mind.
Golden Ram
240387_12_a
No way... Is the ram talking
to me?
Leafa
240387_11_a
It's me.
???
240387_10_a
Hm...? Who was that?
Leafa
240387_9_a
Princess...
???
240387_8_a
N-No... Kazuto...
Leafa
240387_7_a
...!
Leafa
240387_6_a
A player in your party has
been killed.
Leafa
240387_5_a
A progress update on the quest?
Leafa
240387_4_a
Hm...?
Leafa
240387_3_a
This is the opposite of what's
supposed to happen...
Leafa
240387_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
...No.
Leafa
240387_1_a
Kazutooooo!
Leafa
240385_29_a
Baaaaaahhhhh!
Golden Ram
240385_28_a
Listen up, ram! Take Sugu
somewhere safe! I'm counting
on you!
Kirito
240385_27_a
No! I'm not going to leave you!
Leafa
240385_26_a
Go! If we can't defeat them,
only one of us should have to
suffer the penalty!
Kirito
240385_25_a
What?! There's no way
I'm doing that!
Leafa
240385_24_a
Sugu, you go on ahead. I'll stay
behind and buy time for you.
Kirito
240385_23_a
...
Kirito
240385_22_a
There's no way we could take
them all down!
Kirito
240385_21_a
Wh-What should we do? Fight?
Leafa
240385_20_a
Those horses'll catch up with
us in no time!
Kirito
240385_19_a
A cavalry?! Dammit!
Kirito
240385_18_a
A huge cavalry is coming after
us!
Leafa
240385_17_a
Oh my God, look!
Leafa
240385_16_a
Prince! Princess! Stop!!
???
240385_15_a
I guess we'll have to see what
happens...
Kirito
240385_14_a
Huh. Then maybe we're not
supposed to follow the original
storyline after all.
Kirito
240385_13_a
And did you know it's much
more severe if it happens during
this quest?!
Leafa
240385_12_a
True. It doesn't make sense for
a quest to force a death penalty
on a player...
Kirito
240385_11_a
What's the matter with you,
trying to kill your own sister?!
Not to mention the penalty!
Leafa
240385_10_a
I know. But if you don't do this,
we won't be following the story...
Kirito
240385_9_a
Gah! You're right!
Aw, crap! I don't want to die!
Leafa
240385_8_a
Supposed to fall off
the ram and die?
Kirito
240385_7_a
According to the myth,
isn't the princess...
Kirito
240385_6_a
Yeah... Wait... I just
remembered something.
Kirito
240385_5_a
I didn't think it would be THIS
uncomfortable... 
sob
Leafa
240385_4_a
Sheesh! What'd you expect? We're
on the back of a galloping ram!
Kirito
240385_3_a
Kirito
240385_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Hrghh... My butt hurts...
Leafa
240385_1_a
Okay!
Leafa
240383_28_a
A-Alright, here goes! Get on,
Sugu. Don't let go!
Kirito
240383_27_a
Hurry, run!
???
240383_26_a
Yeah.
Leafa
240383_25_a
We should probably listen to
this guy, then.
Kirito
240383_24_a
Yeah. I guess we're role-playing
the Aries story.
Leafa
240383_23_a
Hey, Sugu. Do you think
Kirito
240383_22_a
It's so sparkly and beautiful...
Makes sense that this would
become a constellation!
Leafa
240383_21_a
Whoa, it really is golden!
It's pretty impressive-looking
up close...
Kirito
240383_20_a
Get on this golden ram and go!
Now!
???
240383_19_a
Don't just stand there!
Your stepmother is trying
to kill you for the throne!
???
240383_18_a
He must be an NPC.
Seems pretty tense too...
Leafa
240383_17_a
What the
Kirito
240383_16_a
Leafa
240383_15_a
Kirito
240383_14_a
You two! The army is fast
approaching!
???
240383_13_a
About that. We should be
triggering some sort of event
about now...
Leafa
240383_12_a
Ha ha... Anyway, let's get to
tackling this quest.
Kirito
240383_11_a
Why would you sacrifice the
ram that saved you? And why'd
the sister have to die?
Leafa
240383_10_a
I know, but...
Leafa
240383_9_a
Well...mythological tales aren't
exactly known for their happy
endings.
Kirito
240383_8_a
Talk about a downer of a story!
Leafa
240383_7_a
The brother survives
and sacrifices the ram.
Leafa
240383_6_a
The sister falls off the ram and
tumbles to her death...
Leafa
240383_5_a
They try to escape, but they
have a whole army after them.
Leafa
240383_4_a
A golden ram carries on its
back a prince and princess who
are running for their lives.
Leafa
240383_3_a
Kirito
240383_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Let's see here...
Leafa
240383_1_a
Sounds like a plan!
Leafa
240381_12_a
Let's do some research. I'm
sure the mythological tale will
give us some clues.
Kirito
240381_11_a
Hmm... I guess Aries is the
exception, then.
Kirito
240381_10_a
Another Aries told me that I'd
need another person to complete
the quest.
Leafa
240381_9_a
Really? That's strange...
Leafa
240381_8_a
I thought other people couldn't
help you on those, since they're
all different.
Kirito
240381_7_a
Yup, that's the one.
Leafa
240381_6_a
Of course. Isn't this your
astrological sign-specific
quest, though?
Kirito
240381_5_a
No worries. I'm just glad you're
here to help me on my quest!
Leafa
240381_4_a
Hey. Sorry to keep you
waiting, Sugu.
Kirito
240381_3_a
Kirito
240381_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Ah, Kazuto! Over here!
Leafa
240381_1_a
Hehehe, woooooo! I'm so looking
forward to this!
Leafa
240378_21_a
But I guess I'm glad you're
cheering up.
Kirito
240378_20_a
Well, that was a quick change of
heart...
Kirito
240378_19_a
Hehe... I guess the rainy season's
got its perks too!
Leafa
240378_18_a
Hmm... Fireflies, fireflies...
You know what? You're right!
They are a rainy season treat!
Leafa
240378_17_a
Yeah, the more the merrier!
Leafa
240378_16_a
Ha ha... Sure, but let's invite
Asuna and the rest of the gang.
Kirito
240378_15_a
Awesome! This sounds like tons
of fun! Well, what are we waiting
for? Let's go go go!!
Leafa
240378_14_a
Well, they do, so I had Yui look
into good firefly spots. There's a
really nice one around here.
Kirito
240378_13_a
Fireflies! I totally forgot that
they start coming out in the
rainy season!
Leafa
240378_12_a
They're sort of like fireflies,
anyway. Good enough, right?
Kirito
240378_11_a
To a place where the fireflies
come out in droves. Well, they're
not exactly fireflies...
Kirito
240378_10_a
Where are we going?
Leafa
240378_9_a
Oh, cool. Sugu, get ready.
We leave at dusk.
Kirito
240378_8_a
Search complete, Daddy.
They live around here too.
Yui
240378_7_a
Well... I was thinking there has
to be some special rainy season
activity in ALO...
Kirito
240378_6_a
What are you two up to?
Leafa
240378_5_a
Sure, Daddy.
I'll get right on it!
Yui
240378_4_a
Leafa
240378_3_a
Yui
240378_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Yui, can you look into this
for me?
Kirito
240378_1_a
Why is this my job?!
Kirito
240377_33_a
I'm bored and it's your job to
fix that!
Leafa
240377_32_a
Kazuto, think harder!
Leafa
240377_31_a
Heh heh heh...
You do like running
around outside a lot.
Yui
240377_30_a
sigh
... I get that you're trying
to cheer me up, but outdoor sports
are my thing! Boo, rain!
Leafa
240377_29_a
Or if we want to just chill, we
can curl up at home with a good
book and listen to the rain.
Kirito
240377_28_a
We can also hit up a museum
or go to the movies.
Kirito
240377_27_a
Or we can coordinate a rain-proof
wardrobe and strut about town
in style!
Kirito
240377_26_a
I'm sure there's something.
Rain makes for rainbows.
How about looking for those?
Kirito
240377_25_a
Yui
240377_24_a
Kirito
240377_23_a
Such as? I'm not seeing any
silver lining on this cloud.
Leafa
240377_22_a
And besides, I'm sure there's tons
of fun we can have in the rainy
season too.
Kirito
240377_21_a
But they're trying their best to
make the season feel genuine.
I can't fault them for that.
Kirito
240377_20_a
Yeah, I won't deny that the devs
are being pretty pushy right now.
Kirito
240377_19_a
And isn't everyone starting to get
really cranky over this by now?
Leafa
240377_18_a
So we still have no idea how to
get rid of all this rain...
Leafa
240377_17_a
Apparently, Sakuya is pulling her
hair out over the endless rain
plaguing Sylph territory.
Yui
240377_16_a
All the fairy races' leaders had
a meeting yesterday, and the
minutes were posted on MMO Today.
Yui
240377_15_a
Well, yeah... Probably...
Leafa
240377_14_a
I'm sure lots of people are
looking around for ways to solve
the rain conundrum, right?
Kirito
240377_13_a
Well, everyone's probably feeling
blue and is craving some serious
sunlight right now.
Kirito
240377_12_a
But why go through all that
trouble to stop us from seeing
the sun?
Leafa
240377_11_a
Yup.
Kirito
240377_10_a
So you're saying the devs WANTED
us to sit here and rot in all this
rain and humidity?
Leafa
240377_9_a
That's to stop players from going
above the clouds. It's a pretty
heavy-handed method.
Kirito
240377_8_a
Right, so they made that big hazy
object and put it up there.
Kirito
240377_7_a
Continue.
Leafa
240377_6_a
So they went ahead and made a
whole bunch of rainy season-themed
events.
Kirito
240377_5_a
My guess is that the devs really
wanted it to feel like the rainy
season out here this year.
Kirito
240377_4_a
Hey, chill out. It's all just part
of the game's design.
Kirito
240377_3_a
Kirito
240377_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
So! Explanation now, Kazuto!
Leafa
240377_1_a
Er, no, not really...
Leafa
240375_18_a
You don't want to lose power and
fall to a squashy death, right?
Kirito
240375_17_a
Yeah, but for now, we have to get
back down. Our wings are almost
out of juice.
Kirito
240375_16_a
You do?
Leafa
240375_15_a
I see...
I know what's going on here now.
Kirito
240375_14_a
Leafa...
Yui
240375_13_a
What?! That's so lame!
How am I supposed to see
Mr. Sunshine now?!
Leafa
240375_12_a
That's correct. Likely, it was put
in place to stop players from
flying any higher.
Yui
240375_11_a
That haze is an immortal object?
Kirito
240375_10_a
That is an immortal object put in
place to limit players' movements.
Yui
240375_9_a
Yui? What's up?
Kirito
240375_8_a
Daddy!
Yui
240375_7_a
It moves like it's alive, but it's
not attacking. It's just...sitting
there, watching us.
Kirito
240375_6_a
No...
But it's weird, that's for sure.
Kirito
240375_5_a
That black haze up there...
Is that a monster?
Leafa
240375_4_a
What's wrong, Sugu?
Wait...HUH?!
Kirito
240375_3_a
Kirito
240375_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky_night
Huh...?
Leafa
240375_1_a
Or, I guess we're doing this...
Kirito
240373_33_a
H-Hey, wait!
Kirito
240373_32_a
So on that note...I'm off to
catch some rays!
Leafa
240373_31_a
It's been forever since I've seen
the sun out in the real world-I've
gotta say "HI!" to Mr. Sunshine!
Leafa
240373_30_a
We're this high already, and no
altitude limit anymore! A little
more and we're outta the clouds!
Leafa
240373_29_a
What?
Kirito
240373_28_a
I know, but...
Wait! Why don't we just
fly above the clouds?
Leafa
240373_27_a
There isn't much sun with all
these clouds, so who knows
when our wings will give out?
Kirito
240373_26_a
Fairy wings get their power from
sunlight, you know?
Kirito
240373_25_a
Don't you think you should come
down now? It's dangerous to
be in the air too long.
Kirito
240373_24_a
Y-Yeah... I guess not...
Leafa
240373_23_a
Thunder god, right.
Welp, I don't see anyone holding
a lightning bolt around here.
Kirito
240373_22_a
Yup... I was thinking maybe a
thunder god or something?
Leafa
240373_21_a
Something causing the rain?
As in, not just the weather?
Kirito
240373_20_a
it's gotta be nearby, right?
I figured I'd fly up super high,
take a look around, and find it.
Leafa
240373_19_a
Well, it's humid 'cause it won't
stop raining. So if something's
causing this endless downpour,
Leafa
240373_18_a
What the heck was that about?
Why'd you fly off into the rain?!
Kirito
240373_17_a
Leafa
240373_16_a
bg_event_swamp
Suuuggguuu?
Hellooo? Goodbye?
Kirito
240373_15_a
Umm... Sugu?
What's up?
Kirito
240373_14_a
Wait...!
Leafa
240373_13_a
Maybe? I don't know, it was just
a thought...
Kirito
240373_12_a
What?! You mean something's
CAUSING this disgusting humidity?!
Leafa
240373_11_a
It wasn't? Hmm...
Maybe there's some event going on?
Kirito
240373_10_a
But it was nowhere this horrible
last year...
Leafa
240373_9_a
Oh yeah, I think I remember
reading that somewhere...
Leafa
240373_8_a
So in other words, the climate
here is basically the same as in
Japan.
Kirito
240373_7_a
Though, come to think of it,
Sylph territory and Arun climates
are set to "humid subtropical."
Kirito
240373_6_a
Umm, don't ask me...
Kirito
240373_5_a
Kazuto!
Explanation, you lying liar!
Leafa
240373_4_a
Why is it humid here too?!
Leafa
240373_3_a
Kirito
240373_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
AAAH! WHYYY?!
VR, you have betrayed me!!
Leafa
240373_1_a
You're hopeless...
Kazuto
240371_18_a
You got it! There's no time to
waste! Hurry, Kazuto! Dive!
DIVE!!
Suguha
240371_17_a
So we don't have to deal with any
gross humidity while we're diving.
Perfect solution, right?
Kazuto
240371_16_a
Bingo. All our senses are tuned
into the realm of fantasy when
we're in there.
Kazuto
240371_15_a
You do?! What is-?! Oh...
You just mean log into ALO, huh?
Suguha
240371_14_a
You got me there... Still, I've
got the perfect solution for
our humidity woes.
Kazuto
240371_13_a
Oh, wah wah. It's not like your
stuff smells like roses.
Suguha
240371_12_a
Sugu, I really don't need to know
how gross your stuff is...
Kazuto
240371_11_a
Do you know how stuffy it gets in
there? And the mask smells like
sweat and mold.
Suguha
240371_10_a
And kendo gear is the absolute
worst too.
Suguha
240371_9_a
Yeah. Laundry never dries either.
Kazuto
240371_8_a
Ughhh...
I hate the rainy season.
More than summer, anyway.
Suguha
240371_7_a
Deal with it. Otherwise when the
real summer heat starts, you're
gonna die.
Kazuto
240371_6_a
No way. It's still way too early
in the summer to go full-blast
cooling.
Kazuto
240371_5_a
Kazuto.
Air conditioning. I need it. Now.
Suguha
240371_4_a
Well, it is the rainy season.
Kazuto
240371_3_a
Kazuto
240371_2_a
bg_event_kirigaya_living
Ugh...
So. Humid.
Suguha
240371_1_a
Kirito
240368_18_a
Say cheeeese!
Leafa
240368_17_a
Selfie mode! 3, 2, 1...
Leafa
240368_16_a
Here we go!
Leafa
240368_15_a
R-Right...
Kirito
240368_14_a
Get over here and gimme a hug!
Leafa
240368_13_a
So don't be shy! No one else is
gonna see this, Kazuto!
Leafa
240368_12_a
Sugu...
Kirito
240368_11_a
Even if it never comes true,
this'll be a special memento,
just for me... Nobody else.
Leafa
240368_10_a
But doesn't every girl dream
about having a beautiful wedding
like this?
Leafa
240368_9_a
To be honest... It's not like
I wanted to show this off
to everyone.
Leafa
240368_8_a
Why do you still want the
picture, anyway?
Kirito
240368_7_a
But I thought you weren't
doing the Sylph event.
Kirito
240368_6_a
It'll look weird if you're
all distant like that!
Leafa
240368_5_a
Aww, c'mon! It's supposed to be
a wedding photo, isn't it?
Leafa
240368_4_a
N-No, wait-that's way too close!
Kirito
240368_3_a
Kirito
240368_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
Hey! You gotta come
closer than that.
Leafa
240368_1_a
...What?
Kirito
240367_21_a
Nope! You keep doing that, okay?
Leafa
240367_20_a
So I should give up on
customizing my looks too?
Kirito
240367_19_a
Yep!
Leafa
240367_18_a
"Forget"? As in not do the event?
Kirito
240367_17_a
Huh?
Kirito
240367_16_a
In that case...let's forget it!
Leafa
240367_15_a
...
Leafa
240367_14_a
She's the one who suggested it in
the first place, so it's probably
not my place to say.
Kirito
240367_13_a
Maybe you're right...
Do you think I'm asking
too much of Sakuya?
Leafa
240367_12_a
The other Sylph players might
really resent it, after all.
Kirito
240367_11_a
but actually making it happen
could be a lot harder.
Kirito
240367_10_a
It's one thing to say she'll make
an exception for a single player,
Kirito
240367_9_a
But is Sakuya really gonna
be okay with this?
Kirito
240367_8_a
so you won't need to
customize things that much.
Leafa
240367_7_a
It'll be fine! They're only
judging from the pictures,
Leafa
240367_6_a
The only thing I've ever
customized is my hairstyle...
Kirito
240367_5_a
I don't know how Sylph-ish I can
get this outfit or avatar looking.
Kirito
240367_4_a
Well, I guess it'd be okay, but...
Kirito
240367_3_a
Kirito
240367_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
This Sylph couple event is gonna
be so fun! So, what do you say?
Leafa
240367_1_a
Wow! Thank you so much!
Leafa
240365_22_a
and see if we can't
make an exception.
Sakuya
240365_21_a
Ha ha! Well, that is an issue...
But I'll have a chat with the
other organizers
Sakuya
240365_20_a
And is it okay for a Lord to bend
the rules for something like that?
Leafa
240365_19_a
For real?!
C-Can I really do that?
Leafa
240365_18_a
So, if you were to, say, customize
Kirito to look like a Sylph...
Sakuya
240365_17_a
I won't say "no," but it's still
set up as a Sylph-only event.
Sakuya
240365_16_a
Huh?! So...you mean I can ask
Kirito after all?
Leafa
240365_15_a
Since I'm the one who sets the
rules, perhaps I could bend them.
Sakuya
240365_14_a
At the end of the day, it's just
a fun player-organized event.
Sakuya
240365_13_a
Hmmm...
Sakuya
240365_12_a
But the event's only open
to Sylphs, so that's impossible...
sigh
...
Leafa
240365_11_a
Well, the thing is...
I wanted to ask Kirito.
Leafa
240365_10_a
What are you planning to do?
Sakuya
240365_9_a
Indeed. But you'll need to decide
on someone soon, or you won't
be able to join in.
Sakuya
240365_8_a
Yeesh! Word sure travels fast here.
Leafa
240365_7_a
And that you, er...
"politely declined" Recon.
Sakuya
240365_6_a
I hear you still don't have a
partner for the couples event.
Sakuya
240365_5_a
Oh... Hi, Sakuya.
Leafa
240365_4_a
Why the long face, Leafa?
Sakuya
240365_3_a
Sakuya
240365_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
sigh
...
Leafa
240365_1_a
So it couldn't be Kirito...
Recon
240363_17_a
The notification said this event
was only open to Sylph couples...
Recon
240363_16_a
Wh-Who could it be...?
Recon
240363_15_a
...
Recon
240363_14_a
Huh?!
Hey, wait!
Leafa, wait!!
Recon
240363_13_a
See ya 'round.
Leafa
240363_12_a
Hehe!
That's a secret!
Leafa
240363_11_a
You do?!
Wh-Who is it?
Recon
240363_10_a
Aw, I'm sorry, Recon. I already
have someone else in mind.
Leafa
240363_9_a
S-So! I thought maybe...
If you haven't picked someone,
m-maybe you and me could...
Recon
240363_8_a
Oh, is it now...?
Leafa
240363_7_a
Hey, it's pretty big news
in the Sylph territory!
Recon
240363_6_a
...Heard from who, exactly?
Leafa
240363_5_a
I heard you were thinking of
joining the Sylph Couples Contest!
Recon
240363_4_a
What's up, Recon?
Leafa
240363_3_a
Leafa
240363_2_a
bg_21_alne
H-Hey, Leafa!
Recon
240363_1_a
Hmmm....
Sure looks that way.
Leafa
240361_21_a
Guess we Sylphs are jumping on
the bandwagon too. Hehe!
Sakuya
240361_20_a
Seems the whole game is going nuts
over the wedding theme...
Sakuya
240361_19_a
It's an independent event for Sylph
couples to submit their photos
and decide which one's the best.
Sakuya
240361_18_a
Huh? "Sylph Couple Wedding
Photography Contest"?
Leafa
240361_17_a
What's this window about?
Now, let's see...
Hmm...
Leafa
240361_16_a
Why not try this to help
take your mind off it?
Sakuya
240361_15_a
Errr...
Well, eheh...!
M-Maybe that is a factor...
Leafa
240361_14_a
On a wedding with Kirito?
Sakuya
240361_13_a
Hehe... You sure you're
not just disappointed
about missing out...
Sakuya
240361_12_a
Losing to her in battle
really bummed me out...
Leafa
240361_11_a
Heck, I'm the one who
taught Asuna how to fly
in the first place.
Leafa
240361_10_a
But still! I've been playing this
game for longer than any of
my friends.
Leafa
240361_9_a
Well, she is an expert fighter.
What did you expect?
Sakuya
240361_8_a
Yeah, but we all ended up
getting wailed on by Asuna.
Leafa
240361_7_a
That sounded like a lot of fun.
Sakuya
240361_6_a
Oh yeah! Isn't that the event where
you challenge someone in battle
for the right to get married?
Sakuya
240361_5_a
I didn't stand a chance against
Asuna in that wedding event...
Leafa
240361_4_a
What's up, Leafa?
Sakuya
240361_3_a
Sakuya
240361_2_a
bg_21_alne
sigh
...
Leafa
240361_1_a
Sure thing!
Asuna
240358_19_a
A-As you wish...
But just this once, understood?
Alice
240358_18_a
That's wonderful, Alice!
Let's get to the bridal boutique!
Asuna
240358_17_a
Really?!
Asuna
240358_16_a
Perhaps I am a little curious.
Alice
240358_15_a
And after all you've told
me about this custom...
Alice
240358_14_a
You defeated me fairly. I must
take the terms of our duel with
utmost sincerity.
Alice
240358_13_a
You really want to...?
Asuna
240358_12_a
...No. Allow me to try it.
Alice
240358_11_a
...
Alice
240358_10_a
So if you really don't want to,
I won't force you.
Asuna
240358_9_a
But it's like I said before,
I just wanted an excuse
to hang out with you, Alice.
Asuna
240358_8_a
I'm sure you'll look
wonderful in it.
Asuna
240358_7_a
Ha ha! Well, I'd love to
see you in one!
Asuna
240358_6_a
I take it you'll have me wear that
ceremonial garb of your people,
yes?
Alice
240358_5_a
Fair is fair, Asuna.
I'll follow your wishes.
Alice
240358_4_a
That was a close fight!
You sure are strong...
Asuna
240358_3_a
Asuna
240358_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
That was a fierce battle...
I concede.
Alice
240358_1_a
You got it!
Asuna
240357_18_a
We'll settle this yet!
En garde!
Alice
240357_17_a
Hehe! Alright!
Asuna
240357_16_a
I understand... But we'll see
about that! This battle isn't
over yet!
Alice
240357_15_a
Hehe! Looks like I let it slip
that I was just using that as
an excuse...
Asuna
240357_14_a
Asuna...
Alice
240357_13_a
So taking you out to try on
clothes is as good an excuse
for that as any, right?
Asuna
240357_12_a
Spending time together and
getting to know each other
is important too.
Asuna
240357_11_a
Being friends doesn't just mean
supporting you in battle.
Asuna
240357_10_a
What does that have to do with
those elaborate white garments?
Alice
240357_9_a
That you and Eugeo will be
our friends. That's the promise
I care about.
Asuna
240357_8_a
No, not that one! I mean
your promise to Kirito...
Asuna
240357_7_a
Promise? You mean, for me to wear
the traditional costume of your
people?
Alice
240357_6_a
That's because...I knew if I won,
you'd keep your promise, Alice!
Asuna
240357_5_a
you were a remarkably keen and
nimble opponent just now.
Alice
240357_4_a
How strange... Compared to your
lackluster form against that last
dark creature,
Alice
240357_3_a
I told you not to go easy
on me, hehe!
Asuna
240357_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Hnngh!
Impossible... Such power!
Alice
240357_1_a
Are you asking for a challenge?
Very well, then!
Alice
240355_35_a
And we'll try on wedding dresses!
Asuna
240355_34_a
But if I win, I get to take
you to town...
Asuna
240355_33_a
If you win, you get to lecture
me as much as you like.
Asuna
240355_32_a
...!
Alice
240355_31_a
We'll decide with a sparring
match. How about it?
Asuna
240355_30_a
Alright! Let's make a deal, then.
Asuna
240355_29_a
Hahaha...
Well, you got me there....
Asuna
240355_28_a
Surely you have some combat
training that you must attend to!
Alice
240355_27_a
Must you speak incessantly
of this marriage custom?
Alice
240355_26_a
But there's still no news about
any of the Divine Objects...
Come on, Alice!
Asuna
240355_25_a
N-No, that won't be necessary.
I mustn't lose sight of my
mission.
Alice
240355_24_a
I can take you if you want!
Asuna
240355_23_a
But there are shops where
you can try them on.
Asuna
240355_22_a
Actually, getting a dress
like that isn't easy...
Asuna
240355_21_a
Hehe! If you say so.
Asuna
240355_20_a
N-No, I misspoke.
Please disregard that.
Alice
240355_19_a
Perhaps I can appreciate their
longing to be surrounded by
such splendor...
Alice
240355_18_a
That said... The lovely outfit
is rather eye-catching.
Alice
240355_17_a
Ah, I see...
Asuna
240355_16_a
...It doesn't make any sense to me.
Alice
240355_15_a
...
Alice
240355_14_a
Doesn't that sound nice
to you too, Alice?
Asuna
240355_13_a
And there's a big ceremony where
family and friends celebrate the
start of your new life.
Asuna
240355_12_a
Th-This is...
Alice
240355_11_a
They're called wedding dresses.
In this world, we wear them to
get married.
Asuna
240355_10_a
S-Such a brilliant white outfit...!
Wh-What in the world is this?
Alice
240355_9_a
...!
Alice
240355_8_a
What is it?
Oh my... A Stacia Window.
Alice
240355_7_a
Oh, I think I've got it!
Why don't you take a look at this?
Asuna
240355_6_a
Your world has different values
than ours, Alice, so it might be
hard to understand...
Asuna
240355_5_a
An Integrity Knight's purpose is
to defend the Human Empire from
the Forces of Darkness... No more.
Alice
240355_4_a
Indeed. I told Lisbeth this
as well, but it is none of
my concern.
Alice
240355_3_a
Alice
240355_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Oh...
So Liz filled you in on that.
Asuna
240355_1_a
Huh?
Asuna
240353_25_a
I take it you're preoccupied with
this June Bride tradition of yours,
correct?
Alice
240353_24_a
You seem slow-footed, Asuna.
Alice
240353_23_a
bg_18_mountain
Huh?
Oh, Alice!
Asuna
240353_22_a
Gyaaaaaggghh!
Monster
240353_21_a
bg_black
Hyaaah!!
???
240353_20_a
bg_18_mountain
Ugh... I can't believe that
wasn't enough...!
Asuna
240353_19_a
bg_black
GRAAAAAAAAH!!
Monster
240353_18_a
bg_18_mountain
Take THIS!!
Asuna
240353_17_a
Welp, I guess it's not my
business to worry about
other people's love lives...
Liz
240353_16_a
...Is that all you had to share?
In that case, I shall resume my
search for the Divine Objects.
Alice
240353_15_a
Ah, I see... Knights must have
a pretty strait-laced life.
Liz
240353_14_a
I have neither need nor desire
for such worldly attachments.
Alice
240353_13_a
I am an Integrity Knight,
entrusted by the gods with
protecting my world.
Alice
240353_12_a
Isn't there anyone you like
back in your own world?
Liz
240353_11_a
Oh...
Really?
Liz
240353_10_a
I can appreciate the rationale,
but it clearly doesn't concern me.
Alice
240353_9_a
If you see people getting antsy,
that's probably why.
Liz
240353_8_a
That's the idea behind ALO's June
Bride campai-Uh, I mean tradition!
June Bride tradition.
Liz
240353_7_a
You must know how it feels too!
Wanting to be a bride and
celebrate your love with someone...
Liz
240353_6_a
Well... That's just how it is
with girls, right?
Liz
240353_5_a
But how does that explain
Asuna and the other girls'
strange behavior?
Alice
240353_4_a
this is supposed to be the best
time of year to get married.
Liz
240353_3_a
Alice
240353_2_a
bg_18_tower
So, does that make sense? Because
of the "June Bride" tradition,
Liz
240353_1_a
Huh?! What the heck was
that about...?
Kirito
240351_17_a
Sorry, Kirito! Three's a crowd!
Liz
240351_16_a
H-Hey! Why are you leaving me out?
Kirito
240351_15_a
...As you wish.
Alice
240351_14_a
Y-Yeah, but... Why don't
you and me talk about
it over there, Alice?
Liz
240351_13_a
Do you know what the cause is?
Alice
240351_12_a
Oh, it's you...
You're another of Kirito's
allies. Lisbeth, was it?
Alice
240351_11_a
She's not wrong, Kirito.
Liz
240351_10_a
Hmmm, it doesn't seem that way
to me... Are you sure you're not
imagining it?
Kirito
240351_9_a
I'm not certain. But it gives me
the foreboding feeling of a
gathering storm...
Alice
240351_8_a
Oh? How so?
Kirito
240351_7_a
There's been a change in Asuna's
behavior lately, and in the
other girls too.
Alice
240351_6_a
What do you mean, "odd?"
Kirito
240351_5_a
There's something odd going on...
Alice
240351_4_a
What's wrong, Alice?
Kirito
240351_3_a
Kirito
240351_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
...?
Alice
240351_1_a
But I wasn't
sigh
Kazuto
240348_21_a
And it will most certainly NOT
ever be a good memory!
Suguha
240348_20_a
The memory of you leering at me
in my wet shirt isn't something
I'll soon forget...
Suguha
240348_19_a
Kazuto! You're not off the hook!
Suguha
240348_18_a
Ahaha!
Kotone
240348_17_a
Kotone, you're a miracle worker!
Sugu's finally back in good
spirits!
Kazuto
240348_16_a
And besides, I had lots of fun
playing OS out here in the
mountains with you two!
Suguha
240348_15_a
Hehe, I guess you're right.
Suguha
240348_14_a
Well...
Suguha
240348_13_a
But hey! These little embarrassing
incidents make for good memories,
right? In hindsight, anyway.
Kotone
240348_12_a
What's wrong with you?! I was
cold, wet, and embarrassed!
Nothin' fun about it!
Suguha
240348_11_a
Hehe, yup!
Kotone
240348_10_a
You mean the "fun" of almost
drowning?!
Suguha
240348_9_a
Hehe... So, hurray, right?
You got to re-experience the fun!
Kotone
240348_8_a
Yeah. She was forced to log out
for a bit too. It was crazy.
Kazuto
240348_7_a
Oh yeah, you kinda drowned back
in ALO too, right?
Kotone
240348_6_a
Ugh, tell me about it!
I never thought that sorta
thing'd happen to me twice...
Suguha
240348_5_a
Ahaha... Sounds like you had a
seriously hard time back there,
Suguha.
Kotone
240348_4_a
Kazuto
240348_3_a
Kotone
240348_2_a
bg_event_riverside
Achoo!
Suguha
240348_1_a
sigh
Kirito
240347_27_a
I'm going to get out of this river
and walk over to our stuff.
Don't. You. Look. Capiche?!
Leafa
240347_26_a
I know! Ugh!
Alright, listen up, Kazuto.
Leafa
240347_25_a
Well, at least towel off or
something...
Kirito
240347_24_a
Grrr! It'll take forever to get
all of this dry... Stupid real
world physics...
Leafa
240347_23_a
I know! I know!
Kirito
240347_22_a
Kazuto! Don't you DARE look!!
Leafa
240347_21_a
Kotone
240347_20_a
Wait... AAAAAAH!
My shirt's gone see-through!
Leafa
240347_19_a
Huh? What are you talking about?
Leafa
240347_18_a
S-Sugu... You, um...definitely...
have grown... And it's quite
visible...
Kirito
240347_17_a
Kazuto? What's wrong?
Leafa
240347_16_a
Kotone
240347_15_a
Wh-What?! What's with that weird
scream all of a sudden?!
Leafa
240347_14_a
Waaagh?!
Kirito
240347_13_a
Ha ha...
You've really grown, Sugu!
Kirito
240347_12_a
O-Oh... Good to hear.
Kirito
240347_11_a
The water wasn't deep enough back
then to drown either. I'm not dumb
enough to repeat THAT mistake.
Leafa
240347_10_a
Besides, when I almost drowned
back in ALO, it was because I
panicked.
Leafa
240347_9_a
Kazuto...it's like, a foot deep...
Leafa
240347_8_a
...Wait a sec!
You didn't drown?!
You're a terrible swimmer!
Kirito
240347_7_a
Yikes, you're soaking wet!
Kirito
240347_6_a
Hehe... I'm all right, but I did
manage to fall into the river...
Leafa
240347_5_a
Y-Yeah...
Leafa

Kotone
240347_3_a

Are you all right?!
Kirito
240347_1_a
Kotone
240345_33_a
Don't you dare hurt my sister,
monster! HRRRAAAGH!!
Kirito
240345_32_a
Grawwwrk!!
Monster
240345_31_a
Suguuu!!

Hiiiyaaah!
Leafa
240345_24_a
Kotone
240345_23_a
We missed one!
Kazuto, watch out!
Leafa
240345_22_a
Wha
Kirito
240345_21_a
Kotone
240345_20_a
Leafa
240345_19_a
Kirito
240345_18_a
Grawrk!!
Monster
240345_17_a
Ha ha, I know! Well, anyway...
Let's go find Philia. She went
off that way, last I saw.
Kirito
240345_16_a
We might be one of the only people
ever to find it!
Leafa
240345_15_a
Yeah. I never saw anything about
this location on OS info sites.
Leafa
240345_14_a
This is one lucky find!
Kirito
240345_13_a
But there's a ton of monsters out
here dropping pretty rare loot
left and right!
Kirito
240345_12_a
Me neither.
Kirito
240345_11_a
Phew... That really came out
of left field! I never thought
OS would run out here!
Leafa
240345_10_a
240345_9_a
Leafa
240345_8_a
There! That should be it for this
area.
Kirito
240345_7_a
Graaawr!
Monster
240345_6_a
Hraaagh!!
Kirito
240345_5_a
Sugu!
It's all you!

Kirito

bg_event_riverside
Kazuto!
Leafa
240345_1_a
It was just casual curiosity,
but I didn't expect this!!
Kazuto
240343_27_a
Y-Yeah... I was wondering if OS
would run this deep in the
mountains...
Kazuto
240343_26_a
Wait, is that...?
Kazuto, you put on your Augma?
Kotone
240343_25_a
Kazuto?
What's up?
Suguha
240343_24_a
Huh?
Kazuto
240343_23_a
...
Kazuto
240343_22_a
It's got shade, a nice breeze...
I'm sold.
Kotone
240343_21_a
Kazuto
240343_20_a
Kotone
240343_19_a
bg_event_riverside
How's this spot look?
Suguha
240343_18_a
Oh yeah!
Kazuto
240343_17_a
Yeah!
Kotone
240343_16_a
It's just the three of us today,
but let's have enough fun for
the whole crew!
Suguha
240343_15_a
Ahaha, you tell 'em, Kotone!
Anyway, want to hit the road?
Suguha
240343_14_a
Oh, quiet you! This is my
natural hair color, alright?!
No teasing!
Kotone
240343_13_a
Your ALO hair looks way more
normal, though. Not many Japanese
girls have such light hair.
Kazuto
240343_12_a
But when I converted my character
over to ALO, I had to change my
hair color when I went Spriggan.
Kotone
240343_11_a
Ahaha, yup! My SAO avatar looked
a lot more like the real me.
Kotone
240343_10_a
Wow... You kinda look different
from the Philia I know from ALO...
Suguha
240343_9_a
Right back at you!
Suguha
240343_8_a
Nice to real-meet you, Suguha!
Kotone
240343_7_a
Ahaha, I think so!
Kotone
240343_6_a
Is this the first time we've met
in real life, Kotone?
Suguha
240343_5_a
Hey, Kotone. Thanks for coming.
Kazuto
240343_4_a
Suguha
240343_3_a
Kazuto
240343_2_a
bg_02_forest
Hey hey, guys! How's it hanging?
Kotone
240343_1_a
Yeah, feel free. She lives
pretty close, so she can
hop right over too.
Kazuto
240341_22_a
Okay. Well, then I'll invite her!
Suguha
240341_21_a
Though I suppose I should call
her "Kotone" out of game.
Kazuto
240341_20_a
Yeah. I think the only person
who's free tomorrow is Philia.
Kazuto
240341_19_a
Really?
Suguha
240341_18_a
Nah, don't bother. I remember
them mentioning they'd be super
busy tomorrow.
Kazuto
240341_17_a
Woohoo! I'm gonna invite Asuna
and Shino too!
Suguha
240341_16_a
Yeah, sure. Sounds good to me.
Kazuto
240341_15_a
We've got tomorrow off, right?
It's the perfect time for a trip!
Suguha
240341_14_a
For sure... Hey, I've got an idea!
Let's go back!
Suguha
240341_13_a
The memories are still a bit hazy.
It'd be nice to really remember
our family trips more clearly...
Kazuto
240341_12_a
But...
Suguha
240341_11_a
Yeah, but no need to apologize.
I don't really remember much
from back then myself, anyway.
Kazuto
240341_10_a
We weren't brother and sister yet,
were we?
Suguha
240341_9_a
Ah. Ahhh. AH! Sorry.
Back then, we weren't...
Suguha
240341_8_a
I'm glad you remembered.
Kazuto
240341_7_a
Awesome... Looking at the picture,
it's kinda coming back to me.
Suguha
240341_6_a
We went camping here once waaay
back when.
Kazuto
240341_5_a
Yeaaah. Chichibu mountains,
right by this little stream...
Kazuto
240341_4_a
Um...
Uh...yeah?

Nahaha! Seriously, though...
I'm countin' on ya.

What the
? Easy, Argo...
Kirito
240338_30_a
Ya really looked good, swoopin'
in all gallant-like.
Argo
240338_29_a
Nehehe, don'cha worry 'bout me.
'Sides, you'll come save me again
anyway, won'cha, Kii-boy?
Argo
240338_28_a
We're not in a death game anymore,
but a little caution goes a long
way, Argo.
Kirito
240338_27_a
You've always had a tendency
to ruffle peoples' feathers,
I'll say that.
Kirito
240338_26_a
Yeah, I'm glad we made it.
Sinon
240338_25_a
Even so, ya saved me back there.
I thought I was a goner.
Argo
240338_24_a
Nahaha! C'mon, it was just an
idle threat.
Argo
240338_23_a
You made him cry!
Silica

Knock it off, you two! You're
enjoying this a little too much.

Oh man, his face at the end was
so funny! I thought he was going
to pee himself!
Kirito
240338_18_a
Hnrk! Aaaahhhhhh!
Player B
240338_17_a
Yer gonna find out how well the
Pain Absorber works! Got that?!
Argo
240338_16_a
I took note of yer names 'n'
faces. So next time ya show up...
Argo
240338_15_a
Hngh!
Player B
240338_14_a
Just know that ya won't get so
lucky next time.
Argo
240338_13_a
So thanks fer givin' me fair
warnin' that I gotta be ready fer
situations like this.
Argo
240338_12_a
Well, this proves my hunch that
us info brokers aren't well-liked.
Argo
240338_11_a
...
Argo
240338_10_a
Anything you want to say to this
punk, Argo?
Kirito
240338_9_a
You just don't know when to
shut up, do you?
Sinon
240338_8_a
Damn it! Listen, you...
I'll get you back for this!
Player B
240338_7_a
Tell me...
How does that make you feel?
Sinon
240338_6_a
You wanted to hurt Argo, yet it
was your crew that got wrecked.
My, how the tables have turned.
Sinon
240338_5_a
gulp
Player B
240338_4_a
Argo
240338_3_a
Silica
240338_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
Heh! Looks like you're the only
one left...
Kirito
240338_1_a
Aw, shucks. Silica 'n' Sinon
came too?
Argo
240337_22_a
That's right! Nobody hurts
our Argo!
Silica
240337_21_a
Silica
240337_20_a
Argo
240337_19_a
Yeah, good luck with that.
Sinon
240337_18_a
She's got friends! Get 'em!
Player A
240337_17_a
Looks like I made it just in time.
Kirito

Kirito
240337_15_a
Wha
! Kii-boy!
Argo
240337_14_a
GYAH!
Player B
240337_13_a
HYAAAAAAH!
???
240337_12_a
How about I skin YOU instead!
???
240337_11_a
Time to skin this cat!
Player B
240337_10_a
Hrng!
Argo
240337_9_a
I found her!
Player A
240337_8_a
Whoa!
Argo
240337_7_a
Money really does mess with
people's heads...
Argo
240337_6_a
Urgh. It's gonna be tough ta
escape from that many people,
even fer me.
Argo
240337_5_a
We're gonna force you into early
retirement, Argo!
Player B
240337_3_a
Don't let her get away!
Player B
240337_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
She went that way!
Player A
240337_1_a
Congrats on gettin' so many people
ta join yer little surprise
party... But I've got other plans.
Argo
240335_22_a
Oh boy...
Surrounded.
Argo
240335_21_a
I think she needs to feel a bit
of our pain for herself!
Player A
240335_20_a
you can see why we'd be upset!
Player B
240335_19_a
You've got that right. So when
your little funny money games
start crashing our little party,
Player B
240335_18_a
Yep. Makin' real money off this is
a different story.
Argo
240335_17_a
Relax, she only got paid in Yuld.
Isn't that right?
Player B
240335_16_a
You got paid?!
I swear, I'm gonna
Player A
240335_15_a
Ya don't say no ta tha boss.
'Specially when they pay so well.
Argo
240335_14_a
I had ta do some stuff fer the
Cait Sith leader's event.
Argo
240335_13_a
We wanna know why you restarted
your info broker business after
taking all that time off!
Player B
240335_12_a
So that's what this is about?
I'm keepin' yer little site from
linin' yer pockets?
Argo
240335_11_a
Sorry, I couldn't help it.
Player A
240335_10_a
Shh, shut your yap!
Player B
240335_9_a
Don't get cute! You know you're
the reason the traffic on our tips
and tricks site is down!
Player A
240335_8_a
I don't see anythin' about it
bein' private property.
Argo
240335_7_a
Wait, wait, wait. This dungeon's
part of the Girls' Day event.
Argo
240335_6_a
I think you've gone far enough
in this dungeon!
Player B
240335_5_a
Eh?
Argo
240335_4_a
Hey, you! Argo!
Player A
240335_3_a
Now that'll fetch a pretty penny.
Nahaha!
Argo
240335_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
Ah, I see. Approachin' it like
that makes it easier ta beat.
Argo
240335_1_a
You're not alone in thinking
that.
Sinon
240333_20_a
An ad-supported website...
I can't shake the feeling that
something's off about this.
Silica
240333_19_a
Well, they're running a website.
They must have some deal with
an affiliate to serve up ads.
Sinon
240333_18_a
All they're talking about is money,
though...
Silica
240333_17_a
Seems that way.
Sinon
240333_16_a
And that makes them her rivals.
Silica
240333_15_a
Yeah, and it sounds like they run
a hints and tips site of their
own.
Sinon
240333_14_a
Sinon
240333_13_a
That cat they're talking about
must be Argo.
Silica
240333_12_a
Yeah, I'm aware of that.
Player B
240333_11_a
We've gotta keep page views up
between these seasonal events.
Otherwise we won't make any money!
Player A
240333_10_a
Ah, so that's why we're down.
The ALO articles are the most
popular, after all.
Player A
240333_9_a
Well, she's back in business now,
and that's been tanking our page
views the last couple days!
Player B
240333_8_a
You mean that info broker?
I thought she hadn't sold any
solid info for a while?
Player A
240333_7_a
Silica
240333_6_a
Yeah, what was that about?
Sinon
240333_5_a
Sinon
240333_4_a
Huh? What mangy little cat?
Silica
240333_3_a
Seems she's really back on
the prowl...
???
240333_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Tch! That mangy little cat!
???
240333_1_a
Yeah, 'course.
Argo
240331_21_a
Good luck, Argo!
Let me know if I can help!
Silica
240331_20_a
Nahaha! Don't ya worry 'bout that.
I've been doin' this since SAO.
Argo
240331_19_a
It won't be easy to solo.
Sinon
240331_18_a
There are going to be a ton of
quests and side-quests in that
Girls' Day event, right?
Sinon
240331_17_a
Info's like fish
gotta be fresh.
Argo
240331_16_a
Welp, I gotta start workin' my way
through it ASAP.
Argo
240331_15_a
Yeah, I heard about it.
Sinon
240331_14_a
That's the one. The ALO admins are
puttin' on their own official
Girls' Day event, y'know?
Argo
240331_13_a
You mean as an info broker?
Silica
240331_12_a
Takin' the time out ta run that
event sure put tha brakes on my
core business, though.
Argo
240331_11_a
Oh? Well thank ya muchly, nahaha.
Argo
240331_10_a
I'm even more impressed with you
for directing that event on her
orders, Argo!
Silica
240331_9_a
Yep. That's tha power of Alicia
fer ya.
Argo
240331_8_a
It looks like it's inspired other
Cait Sith players to sharpen their
claws, so to speak.
Sinon
240331_7_a
Yeah, it was pretty involved for
a player-organized event.
Sinon
240331_6_a
Nahaha. I gotta say, that Girls'
Day event was pretty fun.
Argo
240331_5_a
Well, if it ain't Silica 'n' Sinon.
Thank ya.
Argo
240331_4_a
Sinon
240331_3_a
Argo
240331_2_a
bg_21_alne
Thanks for all your hard work
earlier, Argo.
Silica
240331_1_a
Alright! I'll do it!
Then you'll see!
Seven
240318_18_a
But if it really bothers you,
you could always brush up
on your maid skills.
Rain
240318_17_a
Hahaha! Sorry, sorry.
Rain
240318_16_a
Aw, c'mon! Can you give it a rest
with the insults already?!
Seven
240318_15_a
It really was a great idea!
And Seven, you really helped out
by being so hopeless!
Rain
240318_14_a
But someone else diving in
as her could naturally do a
horrible job.
Asuna
240318_13_a
Well, I didn't think it'd be
convincing if Rain just
pretended to be bad.
Kirito
240318_12_a
Still, to dive in as someone else...
That was a great idea, Kirito.
Asuna
240318_11_a
Hahaha!
Kirito
240318_10_a
Wh-What'd you just say! You got a
problem or something?!
Seven
240318_9_a
How was that acting?
You're a natural klutz!
Rain
240318_8_a
and putting my exquisite
acting talents to work!
Seven
240318_7_a
Hehe! You can thank me
for diving in as Rain,
Seven
240318_6_a
As far as anyone needs know,
those forum posts were just
garden-variety trolling.
Asuna
240318_5_a
Any time! I'm glad we could put
an end to this and keep your
identity safe, Rain.
Asuna
240318_4_a
Kirito
240318_3_a
Seven
240318_2_a
bg_18_tower_road_sunset
Thank you, Kirito.
And you too, Asuna and Seven.
Rain
240318_1_a
I-I guess if you say so...
Seven
240317_23_a
she is at even the most basic tasks!
Kirito
240317_22_a
Ha ha! Trust me, she's sure to be
happy now that everyone believes
how staggeringly incompetent
Kirito
240317_21_a
Did we really have to take it this
far? I didn't expect she'd be
making this much of a mess...
Seven
240317_20_a
Yeah... The rest we can leave
up to the forums.
Asuna
240317_19_a
Alright! Looks like
Operation: Bad Reputation
went off without a hitch.
Kirito
240317_18_a
...
Kirito
240317_17_a
Gentlemen, it appears we have
been trolled.
Player D
240317_16_a
Yeah. He said she worked at
some real maid cafe, right?
Player D
240317_15_a
There was even that guy in the
forums wigging out and saying he
figured out her real identity.
Player C
240317_14_a
What gives? She was supposed to
be the best maid ever! That was
flagrant false advertising.
Player C
240317_13_a
Yeah. That Rain girl was all
over the place...
Player B
240317_12_a
Kirito
240317_9_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hey, did you see the live stream?
Player A
240317_8_a
Seven
240317_11_a
Asuna
240317_10_a
Rain
240317_7_a
What happened to the
dependable, graceful Rain
I used to know...?
Head Maid
240317_6_a
I-I'm sorry, ma'am...
Rain
240317_5_a
What's more, the customers are
complaining about your lackluster
tea!
Head Maid
240317_4_a
You've broken a dozen plates
and none of the laundry is
sorted correctly!
Head Maid
240317_3_a
Rain
240317_2_a
bg_s2_20_restaurant
Miss Rain!
What's gotten into you today?!
Head Maid
240317_1_a
I guess so...
Asuna
240315_15_a
Right. Until then, we just stay
cool and wait for her to work
her magic.
Kirito
240315_14_a
S-Sure it will! She's bound
to pull it off.
Seven
240315_13_a
Do you think this plan will work?
Asuna
240315_12_a
Yeah. No telling what will
come of this....
Kirito
240315_11_a
It seems like a lot of players
will be tuning in for today's
live stream...
Asuna
240315_10_a
Seven
240315_9_a
Asuna
240315_8_a
...
Kirito
240315_7_a
I bet loads of people will sign
up just to see her. Hell, that's
what I did. Heh heh...
Player A
240315_6_a
Yeah, she's just like a real maid.
Player B
240315_5_a
I'll say. She's so graceful...
It's like she's done this
a million times.
Player B
240315_4_a
I saw that too!
Man, that girl is amazing.
Her maid skills must be through the roof.
Player D
240315_3_a
Yeah! They said it's gonna feature
that cute maid Rain who was
interviewed in MMO Tomorrow!
Player B
240315_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Dude! Did you see the
thing about the maid event
on the live stream today?
Player A
240315_1_a
I think I'll talk
to Kirito about this.
Asuna
240313_25_a
Still, we don't want the rumors
to spread any further.
Asuna
240313_24_a
It's sweet of you
to worry about me, Nana. But you
didn't do anything wrong.
Rain
240313_23_a
Rain, I'm so sorry... I never
should have pushed you
to accept that interview...
Seven
240313_22_a
Yikes... It sounds like you could
be close to getting doxxed...
Asuna
240313_21_a
Plus, someone was posting in
the forums saying that they
thought it might be me too.
Rain
240313_20_a
asking why I quit and
making a big scene.
Rain
240313_19_a
I heard from one of the staff.
A customer came in,
Rain
240313_18_a
How would he know that?
Asuna
240313_17_a
But this is just as bad,
isn't it? He must know that
I'm Rain in ALO.
Rain
240313_16_a
But that's not the same as your
real identity getting out, right?
Seven
240313_15_a
Yeah...
Rain
240313_14_a
Oh... Rain was your nickname
when you worked there too,
wasn't it?
Asuna
240313_13_a
And from that... Well, I'm worried
he's figured out that Rain and
Nijika Karatachi are the same person.
Rain
240313_12_a
It seems one of the regulars
at the place I used to work
found about the interview...
Rain
240313_11_a
Worried?
Asuna
240313_10_a
To be honest...
I'm kinda worried about something...
Rain
240313_9_a
Hmm?
Something wrong, Rain?
Seven
240313_8_a
Oh... Y-Yeah, that...
Rain
240313_7_a
I can really tell that you're
working hard for your dream
in the real world.
Asuna
240313_6_a
Th-Thank you, Asuna...
Rain
240313_5_a
You were so cute!
And you did well in
the interview too.
Asuna
240313_4_a
Seven
240313_3_a
Rain
240313_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hey, Rain! I read that article
in MMO Tomorrow!
Asuna
240313_1_a
Yeah!
That's the spirit, Rain!
Seven
240311_24_a
R-Right... Okay, I guess
I'll accept the interview.
Rain
240311_23_a
Ahaha! You don't mince words,
do you, Seven?
Asuna
240311_22_a
How can you become a star
in the real world if you can't
even do it in a virtual one?
Seven
240311_21_a
You got it all wrong, Asuna!
It's the principle of the thing!
Seven
240311_20_a
Standing out here doesn't
have much to do with that...
Asuna
240311_19_a
B-But Rain only wants to be a
singer in the real world, right?
Asuna
240311_18_a
Y-Yeah, I know...
Rain
240311_17_a
Pop stars have to stand out
and be noticed!
Seven
240311_16_a
C'mon, Rain! How can you make it
as a singer with an attitude like
that!?
Seven
240311_15_a
I don't really like being
the center of attention.
Rain
240311_14_a
Well...
I'm not too sure myself...
Rain
240311_13_a
Really?!
That's amazing!
Asuna
240311_12_a
MMO Tomorrow even asked if
they could interview me in
my maid outfit.
Rain
240311_11_a
Yeah, it seems that way...
Rain
240311_10_a
Still, I hear your maid work
has gotten pretty popular
among the players.
Asuna
240311_9_a
Hehe... This is nothing like
working at a maid cafe,
though.
Rain
240311_8_a
Y-Yeah... I guess experience
pays off, right, Rain?
Asuna
240311_7_a
Asuna
240311_6_a
Rain
240311_5_a
Rain...
That's my big sis in action.
Seven
240311_4_a
Thank you, ma'am!
Rain
240311_3_a
Very good, Miss Rain.
Perfect attention to detail.
Head Maid
240311_2_a
bg_s2_20_restaurant
Is this all right, ma'am?
Rain
240311_1_a
Really?! Thank you so much!!
Strea
240308_18_a
But if someone makes one, I'll
buy one just for you. Promise.
Kirito
240308_17_a
Umm... How about we forget the
part about me developing android
tech?
Kirito
240308_16_a
So, Kirito, hurry up and get that
robot me fully operational!
Strea
240308_15_a
But I still wanna wear this and
walk around the real world with
you guys!
Strea
240308_14_a
Heh, good for you, Strea.
Philia
240308_13_a
That's right! So bring on the
scary monsters! I'll whack 'em,
smack 'em, and send 'em packing!
Strea
240308_12_a
Oh, awesome!
Philia
240308_11_a
It looks the same as it used to,
but its defense is way higher now.
Kirito
240308_10_a
We seriously leveled up its stats.
Kirito
240308_9_a
Ha ha, I'll back her up on this.
We had Ashley help us out.
Kirito
240308_8_a
Super-powered? What are you
talking about?
Philia
240308_7_a
I won't let you complain about how
a sheet of paper would offer
better protection anymore!
Strea
240308_6_a
Yup! But this time, it's
super-powered!
Strea
240308_5_a
You're back in that outfit again,
Strea?
Philia
240308_4_a
Kirito
240308_3_a
Philia
240308_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Ta-dah!
Strea
240308_1_a
Ha ha, sounds fun.
I'll get right on that.
Kirito
240307_17_a
Then download me into it so I can
hang out with you in the real
world!
Strea
240307_16_a
That does sound cool!
Kirito! Go make me one!
Strea
240307_15_a
It'd be really cool if someone
built an android that we could
download you into...
Kirito
240307_14_a
That probe I built is nice, but
there are definite limits to what
it can do.
Kirito
240307_13_a
I mean, I did borrow Yui's probe
once, but that was only for a
little bit.
Strea
240307_12_a
Well, I can't go to the real world.
Strea
240307_11_a
Let's see... In the real world,
people wear it for school.
That's about it.
Kirito
240307_10_a
Uh... I did not see that question
coming.
Philia
240307_9_a
Dress for the job, got it.
Question! What job's appropriate
for this outfit?
Strea
240307_8_a
Strea, it's like this... Cute's all
well and good, but you have to
dress for the job.
Philia
240307_7_a
Y-Yeah, it is cute, but...
Kirito
240307_6_a
What's wrong with it?!
It's cute, isn't it?!
Strea
240307_5_a
Every other second you're
complaining about my outfit!
Strea
240307_4_a
Philia
240307_3_a
Kirito
240307_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Hmph! What is with you two today?!
Strea
240307_1_a
It's just kinda inappropriate...
Philia
240305_24_a
When you try to act serious
with that outfit on...
Philia
240305_23_a
It's just...
How do I put this...
Kirito
240305_22_a
I'm getting all sorts of angry
vibes from you right now...
Strea
240305_21_a
Um... Why are you two glaring
at me like that?
Strea
240305_20_a
...
Kirito
240305_19_a
...
Philia
240305_18_a
Yeah...
I think I'm gonna cry...
Strea
240305_17_a
What a sad story...
Kirito
240305_16_a
sniff
Philia
240305_13_a
I only wish I could have told her
I loved her before she died...
NPC
240305_12_a
Strea
240305_15_a
Kirito
240305_14_a
She wanted to apologize to me...
She wrote this letter, and I...
NPC
240305_11_a
You see, the night before the
monsters attacked, my daughter and
I got into a fight...
NPC
240305_10_a
Her body was found yesterday
clutching this letter...
NPC
240305_9_a
...
Strea
240305_8_a
We fled, but my daughter went
missing... I wanted to believe she
made it out okay, but...
NPC
240305_7_a
...
Kirito
240305_6_a
...
Philia
240305_5_a
Strea
240305_4_a
Kirito
240305_3_a
Philia
240305_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Monsters destroyed our village...
NPC
240305_1_a
sigh
Kirito
240303_24_a
Kirito! How cruel! You want mean
old monsters to kill defenseless
little me?!
Strea
240303_23_a
It'd be better if Strea was on
the front lines with us...
Kirito
240303_22_a
Our current formation's the best
chance we got at beating tougher
monsters.
Philia
240303_21_a
Well, I guess there's no point
arguing with her. We'll just have
to keep on as we have been.
Philia
240303_20_a
R-Right... Yay.
Kirito
240303_19_a
Nope! Not happening!
I like this outfit too much to
strip it off!
Strea
240303_18_a
Strea... Please, put on something
with a little more defense...
For us?
Kirito
240303_17_a
Yup! So, come on! The next area
awaits!
Strea
240303_16_a
Yeah, one hit from a monster in
that outfit and you can kiss all
your HP goodbye.
Philia
240303_15_a
Hehehe... Sorry, guys! I made
you two do all the work out
there today!
Strea
240303_14_a
Bigger question, you're an NPC...
Where do you pick up all of those
weird phrases?
Philia
240303_13_a
Says you... You were goofing
around in the back the whole time.
Kirito
240303_12_a
What's with the long faces?! Perk
up, buck up, and get your pep on!
Don't let a dumb boss get ya down!
Strea
240303_11_a
Same here.
Kirito
240303_10_a
Er, as I was saying... That last
boss was ridiculously tough. I was
so tense, I'm mentally exhausted.
Philia
240303_9_a
Strea...
Kirito
240303_8_a
Guys! Guys! I had SO MUCH FUN!!
Strea
240303_7_a
Y-Yeah, but that's only 'cause
Philia
240303_6_a
You're one to talk. You're
gasping for air like you just
ran a marathon.
Kirito
240303_5_a
Um, Kirito...? You're not supposed
to get tired playing VRMMOs...
Philia
240303_4_a
Strea
240303_3_a
Philia
240303_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Phew...
I'm beat...
Kirito
240303_1_a
Woohoo!!
Kirito, I love you!!
Strea
240301_23_a
Fine, I give up.
Do whatever you want.
Kirito
240301_22_a
She's got us there...
Philia
240301_21_a
But isn't part of playing a game
about trying all sorts of things
and having all sorts of fun?
Strea
240301_20_a
But you're a Gnome, Strea...
You're built to play a front-line
DPS...
Kirito
240301_19_a
Well, I'm choosing this! I'll stay
back and play support!
Strea
240301_18_a
Philia
240301_17_a
Y-Yeah, I did, but...
Kirito
240301_16_a
Besides, didn't you just say that
it's my choice what I wear?
Strea
240301_15_a
Nope! I like this outfit, so I'm
wearing it and you can't stop me!
Strea
240301_14_a
Maybe you should change into
something a little more
battle-ready?
Kirito
240301_13_a
It is going to be tough...
Hey, Strea?
Kirito
240301_12_a
Uh, Strea? The next quest we're
doing has some super tough mobs.
You sure you're going to be okay?
Philia
240301_11_a
It's got terrible physical and
magical defense stats, and doesn't
grant any special abilities...
Philia
240301_10_a
Nope, not really.
Strea
240301_9_a
That uniform doesn't offer that
much protection, right?
Philia
240301_8_a
I just hope it won't be a problem
when it comes time to fight...
Kirito
240301_7_a
Right... Well, it's your choice
what you wear.
Kirito
240301_6_a
Yup! It's too cute not to wear!
Strea
240301_5_a
Hey, Strea. Back in your sailor
uniform?
Kirito
240301_4_a
Philia

Yeah! To adventure!
Silica

Asuna
240298_26_a
W-Well, hey, more fairy tales
await us, right? Let's get going!
Kirito
240298_25_a
Silica
240298_24_a
Yeah-yeah, rub our noses in it.
Liz
240298_23_a
Kirito
240298_22_a
Buuut since Kirito here was my
prince, I'm pretty darned happy
about the whole thing.
Asuna
240298_21_a
Kirito
240298_20_a
Ahaha... Well, it was pretty
horrible at first. I'd have loved
to tag out.
Asuna
240298_19_a
Well, good for you two! So,
Asuna...how was it? How'd you
like being Cinderella?
Silica
240298_18_a
Silica
240298_17_a
W-We did?
Liz
240298_16_a
Kirito
240298_15_a
Hehe, I'll give you ALL the
details later. But hey!
We got Cinderella's story! Yay!
Asuna
240298_14_a
Silica
240298_13_a
What kind of stupid ending is
that?!
Liz
240298_12_a
Instead, we beat up some
monsters, and now Cinderella and
the prince are happily married.
Kirito
240298_11_a
Ha ha, don't ask me why, but it
looks like they cut that part out.
Kirito
240298_9_a
Asuna
240298_10_a
Isn't the prince supposed to be
using Cinderella's glass slipper
to search for her right about now?
Silica
240298_8_a
But...why?
Silica
240298_7_a
Liz
240298_6_a
Huh?! Both of you are back?!
Silica
240298_5_a
Kirito
240298_4_a
Hey Liz! Hey Silica!
Asuna

Silica

bg_21_alne
Welcome back, Kirito.
Liz
240298_1_a
Y-Yeah!
Asuna
240297_38_a
Alright! Asuna, let's waste these
monsters!
Kirito
240297_37_a
Ha ha, awesome! This twist makes
it way more fun than the original!
Kirito
240297_36_a
WAH! The wicked stepsisters
turned into monsters?!
Asuna
240297_35_a
Asuna
240297_34_a
Kirito
240297_33_a
GRAAWRGH!!
Monster
240297_32_a
I'll see you dead before a lazy,
worthless fool like you gets the
prince!!
Wicked Stepsister
240297_31_a
I'll never forgive you, Cinderella!
I'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!
Wicked Stepsister
240297_30_a
Ah. So I guess they were invited
to the ball as well.
Kirito
240297_29_a
U-Um, that woman is my stepsister!
Asuna
240297_28_a
Wh-Why are YOU here?! And why
were YOU the one he had to
choose?! WHY WHY WHY?! RRAGH!
Wicked Stepsister
240297_27_a
Asuna
240297_26_a
Wha
Kirito
240297_25_a
C-Cinderella?!
???
240297_24_a
Asuna...
Kirito
240297_23_a
I'm so happy the one who found
me...was you.
Asuna
240297_22_a
O-Oh, is that so?
Kirito
240297_21_a
Hehe, I'm really happy. I wasn't
looking forward to having to marry
another guy, even for pretend.
Asuna
240297_20_a
W-Wow... Awesome!
Asuna
240297_19_a
One prince, at your service.
Kirito
240297_18_a
Ha ha. Looks like this fairy tale
forced me to play a part too.
Kirito
240297_17_a
K-Kirito?! Wh-Why are you here?!
Asuna
240297_16_a
Asuna
240297_15_a
I've looked everywhere for you,
Asuna.
Kirito
240297_14_a
Huh?
Whaaaaaat?!
Asuna
240297_13_a
Fair lady, would you do me the
honor of a dance?
???
240297_12_a
What's going to happen to me now?
Asuna
240297_11_a
sigh
...
Well, here I am. Castle. Yay.
Asuna
240297_10_a
I need to play things by the
book here...
Kirito
240297_9_a
I already know who I'm supposed to
pick. Besides, Asuna'd kill me if
messed up on purpose.
Kirito
240297_8_a
Okay, now I'm really curious.
Let's see what happens if
No! Bad me!
Kirito
240297_7_a
Would the quest fail, since the
prince didn't pick the right
Cinderella?
Kirito
240297_6_a
What'll happen if I don't pick
Asuna?
Kirito
240297_5_a
R-Right...
Kirito
240297_4_a
Choose, Your Highness. Invite
whichever damsel catches your
fancy to a dance.
Soldier
240297_3_a
It's going to be real hard to pick
Asuna out of the crowd here...
Kirito
240297_2_a
bg_event_minotaur
Whoa... Look at all the fancy
ladies...
Kirito
240297_1_a
Y-Yeah!
Kirito
240295_32_a
Now hurry up and go see Asuna!
She's waiting for you!
Silica
240295_31_a
Stop trying to play it cool!
You're grinning from ear to ear!
Liz
240295_30_a
Sorry, girls, I'll be back in a
snap.
Kirito
240295_29_a
B-But... Well... Alright...
I guess I'm going to a ball.
Kirito
240295_28_a
Umm... Kirito, I think you've
been chosen to play the prince!
Liz
240295_27_a
The entire night will be for
naught if you are not in
attendance!
Soldier
240295_26_a
Today is a most important ball,
you know that! You are to choose
your future bride!
Soldier
240295_25_a
Huh? Prince? Are you talking
to me?!
Kirito
240295_24_a
Come, Prince! We must hurry to
the castle!
Soldier
240295_23_a
Wh-What's going on?! All those
soldiers are running over here!
Silica
240295_22_a
Silica
240295_21_a
Liz
240295_20_a
Say what?
Kirito
240295_19_a
Prince! I've been looking
everywhere for you!
???
240295_18_a
N-No, I swear! I'll just sit here
quietly and wait for her to come
back...
Kirito
240295_17_a
Kirito, be honest. You really want
to go to the castle and check
on her, right?
Silica
240295_16_a
N-No, it's fine. I don't want to
smother her or anything...
Kirito
240295_15_a
Even if it's just for a quest, you
don't want to see any other guy
cozying up to your Asuna, right?
Liz
240295_14_a
You're a terrible liar.
Liz
240295_13_a
Er, n-no, I'm fine. Really.
Kirito
240295_12_a
Heh. Kirito, you don't look that
pleased right now.
Liz
240295_11_a
Yeah, that is how it goes.
Kirito
240295_10_a
That slipper's how the prince
eventually finds her again.
Then they get married, hurray.
Liz
240295_9_a
Next up, the prince falls in love
with her at first sight, and she
runs away leaving a glass slipper.
Liz
240295_8_a
Yeah... It's just like the fairy
tale.
Silica
240295_7_a
Silica
240295_6_a
Liz
240295_5_a
Awesome. Asuna's on her way to
the castle now.
Kirito
240295_4_a
R-Right...

carriage shall take you to the
castle ball.

240293_32_a
Um... I think I'll pass, Asuna...
Ah ha ha ha...
Silica
240293_31_a
Asuna
240293_30_a
Cinderella! What are you doing,
you dolt?! Hurry up and GET
OVER HERE!
Wicked Stepmother
240293_29_a
Silica... If you want to switch
places, I'd be happy to.
Asuna
240293_28_a
Kirito
240293_27_a
Liz
240293_26_a
I'm sure it's tough, but actually
I'm a bit jealous, Asuna. You get
to be Cinderella!
Silica
240293_25_a
I really don't want to get yelled
at or insulted...
But I'll give it my best.
Asuna
240293_24_a
We came to this island to be part
of fairy tales, so I guess I just
got what I asked for...
Asuna
240293_23_a
What?! No way, this is cruel...
But... O-Oh fine...
Asuna
240293_22_a
Silica
240293_21_a
Liz
240293_20_a
Do you mind sticking it out as
Cinderella for a bit?
Kirito
240293_19_a
Silica
240293_18_a
Liz
240293_17_a
I'd say that's pretty likely.
Asuna, sorry about this, but...
Kirito
240293_16_a
I-Is that what's going on here?
Asuna
240293_15_a
Kirito
240293_14_a
Liz
240293_13_a
And Asuna's playing Cinderella?!
Silica
240293_12_a
Does this mean that one of Grimms'
Fairy Tales has just started?
Liz
240293_11_a

240293_9_a
Dude... Scary...
Kirito
240293_8_a
Silica
240293_10_a
And don't be late with dinner!
You've got laundry to do too! Lots
of it! So hurry and get to work!
Wicked Stepsister
240293_7_a
And when you're done with that,
clean the house too!
Wicked Stepsister
240293_6_a
Stand up, you slob! Hurry and
clean the yard, NOW!
Wicked Stepmother
240293_5_a
I have NO idea! I was just passing
by when these women jumped out and
started yelling at me...

240291_24_a
So then that's Cinderella...
Kirito
240291_23_a
Oh, you just might be right!
She certainly sounds wicked!
And those must be her stepsisters!
Silica
240291_22_a
Hey! Do you think that's
Cinderella's wicked stepmother?!
Liz
240291_21_a
It looks like someone's getting
chewed out by those women in
front of that estate.
Kirito
240291_20_a
You lazy, worthless wretch!
???
240291_19_a
I thought I told you to clean up!
Can't you do anything right?!
???
240291_18_a
Wh-What was that? It sounded
like some woman was just
shouting...
Silica

Wah?!

Useless fool!
???

Hmm, wait a sec...
Where's Asuna?
Kirito
240291_12_a
Ha ha. Well, I don't get the appeal
myself, but I guess it tickles
every young maiden's fancy.
Kirito
240291_11_a
Well, duh, it IS the Cinderella
Story. But yeah, every little
girl loves that one.
Liz
240291_10_a
It's like the perfect Cinderella
Story!
Silica
240291_9_a
Oh, I love that story! A poor
young girl and a prince fall in
love, and she becomes a princess!
Silica
240291_8_a
Ah, the good ol' tale of a girl
and a glass slipper.
Kirito
240291_7_a
Cinderella!

land of fairy tales.)

N-No, it's okay. I know you were
just trying to protect me.
Leafa

Well then, I'd have to apologize.
Sorry if that was too much, Leafa.
Kirito

You say that, but what happens
when you go so far as to terrify
her in the process? Hm?!

to harm my little sister.

Go ahead! This game's only around

That doesn't matter to me. I'll
just call the admins and have your

apologize or something!

Gah, they're on to me!
???
240285_34_a
Man, people didn't waste any time
trying to break the rules!
Kirito
240285_33_a
We're on the same page then.
Where'd it come from?
Kirito
240285_32_a
Sounded like a shutter going off
to me!
Liz
240285_31_a
Liz
240285_30_a
Hm? What was that?
Kirito
240285_29_a
Yessss!
???
240285_28_a
Yeah, well it FELT like you were
taking a shot at me...
Kirito
240285_27_a
Oh, no reason...
Liz
240285_26_a
Why'd you look at me when you
said that?
Kirito
240285_25_a
Blech. So creepy.
Liz
240285_24_a
Well, that's the audience for most
gravure idols, so...
Kirito
240285_23_a
Amongst the guys, anyway...
Liz
240285_22_a
Liz
240285_21_a
Wow, she's super popular!
Kirito
240285_20_a
Ehehe...
Leafa
240285_19_a
Leafa, over here!
Player
240285_18_a
Leafa
240285_17_a
Leafa!
Player
240285_16_a
Kirito
240285_15_a
Yep. Keep an eye out.
Liz
240285_14_a
It's starting!
Kirito
240285_13_a
Once again, I would like to remind
our guests that photography
is prohibited.
Announcer
240285_12_a
The public photo shoot for
Gravure Idol Leafa is about to
begin.
Announcer
240285_11_a
Still. I appreciate it.
Kirito
240285_10_a
She's my friend too, y'know.
Liz
240285_9_a
There's no need to thank me.
Liz
240285_8_a
Ah, I see. Well I appreciate you
watching out for her like this.
Kirito
240285_7_a
But Leafa was feeling antsy about
it, so I figured she'd feel safest
with someone on guard duty.
Liz
240285_6_a
Not that we're expecting any.
It's just a photo shoot that's
open to the public.
Liz
240285_5_a
I'll be on the lookout for any
creepers hanging around Leafa's
photo shoot.
Kirito
240285_4_a
Sure do.
Kirito
240285_3_a
Kirito
240285_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Alright, Kirito, you know what
to do.
Liz
240285_1_a
Yeah...
Leafa
240283_22_a
Ah. And that's bugging you, huh?
Liz
240283_21_a
No, but they all get to come
watch the photo shoot itself.
Leafa
240283_20_a
So EVERYONE gets to come take
photos of you?
Liz
240283_19_a
It's going to be open to the
public...
Leafa
240283_18_a
Still, I don't see what's so bad
about it.
Liz
240283_17_a
Yeah, I know...
Leafa
240283_16_a
But I'm not surprised this game
has this kind of quests.
Liz
240283_15_a
Okay, whew. That's good news.
Liz
240283_14_a
They wouldn't put any swimsuit or
lingerie shoots in the game.
Leafa
240283_13_a
No, it's nothing like that.
I just have to do a photo shoot in
the outfit I'm wearing.
Leafa
240283_12_a
Waaait a second!
Aren't those usually pretty...
risque?
Liz
240283_11_a
Yeah, like all gravure idols do,
apparently.
Leafa
240283_10_a
A photo shoot, huh?
Liz
240283_9_a
Long story short, I have to do
a photo shoot.
Leafa
240283_8_a
It's a quest only Gravure Idols
can accept.
Leafa
240283_7_a
Why? What kind of quest is it?
Liz
240283_6_a
But it's gonna suck...
Leafa
240283_5_a
I'm gonna go do an event quest.
Leafa
240283_4_a
Leafa
240283_3_a
What's eating you, Leafa?
Liz
240283_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Ugh...
Leafa
240283_1_a
Urk...!
See? I didn't even need to say
it to set you off...
Kirito
240281_20_a
You are so GROSS!
Why the hell were you looking at
me like that?!
Leafa
240281_19_a
Oh no, here it comes...!
Kirito
240281_18_a
Why would I slap yo
Oh. My. GOSH!
Leafa
240281_17_a
It's too weird! And you'll
probably slap me!
Kirito
240281_16_a
Why nooooot?!
Leafa
240281_15_a
Nope, I can't do it. I can't say
it in front of you!
Kirito
240281_14_a
Quit stalling and tell me already!
Leafa
240281_13_a
Your ALO avatar had, um...
How do I put this...
Kirito
240281_12_a
...What?
C'mon, spit it out!
Leafa
240281_11_a
And since you imported your ALO
avatar... Well...
Kirito
240281_10_a
Well, Pop Star Online creates an
avatar based on the features of
the avatar you import.
Kirito
240281_9_a
Everyone else just gets to be your
ordinary, run-of-the-mill
star. Why'd I get singled out?
Leafa
240281_8_a
Oh, that. I don't think I'm the
right person to ask, actually...
Kirito
240281_7_a
Why do I have to be some sleazy
gravure idol in this game?
Leafa
240281_6_a
Why you...what?
Kirito
240281_5_a
I just don't get it!
Why me?!
Leafa
240281_4_a
Leafa
240281_3_a
What's wrong, Leafa?
Kirito
240281_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Rrrrrgh!
Leafa
240281_1_a
I love you!
Yui
240278_22_a
Mommy... Daddy...
Thank you so much!
Yui
240278_21_a
No matter what, you're our
darling daughter.
Kirito
240278_20_a
I'm with Asuna here.
Backstory doesn't matter one bit.
Kirito
240278_19_a
Hehe, that's so like you, Yui.
Don't worry, your mommy
understands.
Asuna
240278_18_a
Yui...
Kirito
240278_17_a
I still want to spend every day
cheering my mommy and daddy on!
Yui
240278_16_a
Well, I still want to make one
thing clear
even if pixies were
sent to manipulate the fairies,
Yui
240278_15_a
There's no way I'd mistrust you
just because I learned something
about the pixies' origin.
Kirito
240278_14_a
W-Wait a sec, hold on!
I just meant they seemed off in
the backstory.
Kirito
240278_13_a
Which means, he must mistrust the
Aesir emissaries: pixies.
Like me...
Yui
240278_12_a
Daddy said he didn't trust the
Aesir.
Yui
240278_11_a
Sorry...
I'm lost here, Yui...
Asuna
240278_10_a
Oh, uh...yes.
Yui
240278_9_a
Umm... Is this about that pixie
backstory we discovered the other
day?
Kirito
240278_8_a
I'm Mommy and Daddy's support
pixie, so I'm here to cheer you
on!
Yui
240278_7_a
And why are you in that
cheerleader outfit again...?
Kirito
240278_6_a
Yui, where the heck did that
come from?
Asuna
240278_5_a
Gah! Yui...?!
Kirito
240278_4_a
Asuna
240278_3_a
Kirito
240278_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Hurray! Hurray!
Go Mommy! Go Daddy!
Yui
240278_1_a
...
Yui
240277_30_a
My gut tells me that the Aesir
might not be totally above board.
Let's keep our eyes open...
Kirito
240277_29_a
He did, didn't he...?
Asuna
240277_28_a
Didn't he say something about us
trusting the gods too much?
Kirito
240277_27_a
Yeah, but remember when we fought
Thrymr?
Kirito
240277_26_a
Really? But the Aesir are Norse
gods, right? Aren't the gods the
good guys?
Asuna
240277_25_a
Wow, these Aesir seem like jerks.
I get the feeling they're just
using us fairies.
Kirito
240277_24_a
Yes, it appears that way.
Yui
240277_23_a
But to Alfheim, they're servants
of the Aesir: tools to secure a
vital ally.
Kirito
240277_22_a
Yeah. To players, pixies are just
helpful tutorial characters that
explain game mechanics.
Kirito
240277_21_a
I get it... The pixies were sent
by the Aesir to secure the fairies
as allies for this war of theirs.
Asuna
240277_20_a
We have sent the pixies to aid
the fairies who dwell in Alfheim
as a token of our good will.
Yui
240277_19_a
Alfheim lies betwixt the realms
above and below the earth. It is
of dire importance to our war.
Yui
240277_18_a
We, the Aesir, have battled the
foul giants of Nibelheim for ages
without end.
Yui
240277_17_a
So pixies are...divine messengers?
Asuna
240277_16_a
Asgard? That's the world of the
gods said to exist far above
Alfheim.
Kirito
240277_15_a
Pixies are emissaries of Asgard,
sent to the fairy realms...
Yui
240277_14_a
Kirito
240277_13_a
They are?
Asuna
240277_12_a
Let's see...
"Pixies are unlike the fairies
that dwell in Alfheim."
Yui
240277_11_a
Yui, give it a read for us!
Asuna
240277_10_a
Wow! It is! It's about pixies!
Yui
240277_9_a
This is...
Yui
240277_8_a
Looks that way. Now let's see what
this monument says.
Kirito
240277_7_a
Which means you were right and we
fulfilled the condition that
revealed this text?
Asuna
240277_6_a
Something is definitely written
on that thing.
Kirito
240277_5_a
Yeah, it sure is monumental.
Wait a sec...!
Asuna
240277_4_a
Kirito
240277_3_a
Asuna
240277_2_a
bg_04_field_bridge_sunset
Over there. That's the monument.
Yui
240277_1_a
Okay!
Yui
240275_32_a
So let's go check out this
monument.
Kirito
240275_31_a
Ye who read my words sounds like
a quest trigger to me. Reading it
might have unlocked something.
Kirito
240275_30_a
What could this passage mean?
Asuna
240275_29_a
There was some kind of stone
monument up there, but I don't
remember anything written on it...
Asuna
240275_28_a
I'm guessing the "crown" means the
top, where Yggdrasil City is now.
Asuna
240275_27_a
That's the last of it.
Yui
240275_26_a
If ye seek answers, journey to
the World Tree's crown.
Find the monument...
Yui
240275_25_a
Ye who read this parchment,
heed my words...
Yui
240275_24_a
Translation finished.
Yui
240275_23_a
But why is it the only one written
in Old Norse?
Kirito
240275_22_a
I'm not getting a very "pixie"
vibe from this last page...
Kirito
240275_21_a
Yes, please hold on one moment.
Yui
240275_20_a
Hmm...this is in Old Norse.
Yui, can you translate for us?
Asuna
240275_19_a
Please read this last page.
Yui
240275_18_a
Find something, Yui?
Kirito
240275_17_a
It seems that way...
Wait...!
Yui
240275_16_a
Yeah... Nothing but info on
geography, magic, the fairies,
and history...
Asuna
240275_15_a
Welp, nothing special in here at
all.
Kirito
240275_14_a
...
Yui
240275_13_a
Then let's pin our hopes on this
last book!
Kirito
240275_12_a
Ah, I see...
Asuna
240275_11_a
This is the only one of those that
we haven't read yet.
Yui
240275_10_a
Not LAST last, but the last book
that came up when I searched for
books with the keyword "pixie."
Yui
240275_9_a
The last one? Like, last last?
Asuna
240275_8_a
item_event_book
Mommy, Daddy, this is the last
book.
Yui
240275_7_a
but absolutely nothing about the
pixies...
Kirito
240275_6_a
Nope, it's not. There are a bunch
of books on Alfheim's backstory
in here,
Kirito
240275_5_a
Our search isn't going that well,
is it?
Asuna
240275_4_a
Asuna
240275_3_a
Yui
240275_2_a
bg_12_church_lounge
Hmm...
Kirito
240275_1_a
Yay! Sounds like fun!
Yui
240273_32_a
Yeah, we might just find
something.
Kirito
240273_31_a
So, sound like a good place to
start? Shall we go?
Asuna
240273_30_a
Come to mention it, Sugu said the
same thing.
Kirito
240273_29_a
Sinonon told me that there's a
bunch of reference books on the
creation of Alfheim in there.
Asuna
240273_28_a
There's that big library in Arun,
right?
Asuna
240273_27_a
Yeah, I'm down.
So, where do we start?
Kirito
240273_26_a
Let's look into it! Okay?!
Asuna
240273_25_a
B-But hold up! Maybe they have
some kind of super-cool backstory
that no one's discovered yet?
Asuna
240273_24_a
I...can't deny that possibility.
Yui
240273_23_a
It sort of feels like the devs
threw them in as an afterthought
as a nod to Tinkerbell.
Kirito
240273_22_a
Ha ha, well, she has a point.
Their primary game function is to
guide players.
Kirito
240273_21_a
What?!
Mommy, that's rude!
Yui
240273_20_a
Maybe the devs just didn't give
that much thought to their
backstory?
Asuna
240273_19_a
Unlike the other fairy races,
they have neither country nor
defining features.
Yui
240273_18_a
Good points. Pixies are set to
guide individual players.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Yui
240273_17_a
It's not like they're some sort of
secret tenth fairy race and they
don't fight any fairy wars...
Kirito
240273_16_a
But where do the comparatively
tiny pixies fit into all of that?
Kirito
240273_15_a
There are nine fairy races who
fight for control over this land,
right?
Kirito
240273_14_a
Yeah, but honestly, I still don't
really understand what that means
in Alfheim.
Kirito
240273_13_a
That's a good point.
Yui's a pixie here, isn't she?
Asuna
240273_12_a
Strea's an MHCP too, but she's
just another Gnome here.
Kirito
240273_11_a
No, actually. Yui, you're a
private pixie slash navigation
pixie here in ALO, right?
Kirito
240273_10_a
You're referring to the fact that
I'm now a combat-capable
character?
Yui
240273_9_a
I was just wondering how Yui's
being treated by the system now.
Kirito
240273_8_a
Uh, nope. Not about training,
anyway.
Kirito
240273_7_a
Have another helpful comment,
Kirito?
Asuna
240273_6_a
Hmm...
Kirito
240273_5_a
Yeah, just like that!
Asuna
240273_4_a
Kirito
240273_3_a
Asuna
240273_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Hyaaah!
Yui
240273_1_a
Okay, I get it. Sorry.
I'll be quiet now.
Kirito
240271_24_a
...
Asuna
240271_23_a
Thanks!
Yui
240271_22_a
Yeah, that's my girl! Yui, keep up
that spirit and you'll go far!
Kirito
240271_21_a
Rather, it makes me want to try
even harder! I want to get good
enough to take Daddy's advice!
Yui
240271_20_a
Mommy, it's okay. I won't let
something like that get me down.
Yui
240271_19_a
Oh, umm... Well...
Asuna
240271_18_a
So, in other words, I'm still too
unskilled to effectively take
Daddy's advice.
Yui
240271_17_a
If you want to get stronger, it's
important to take everything
including advice
step by step.
Asuna
240271_16_a
Ouch...
Kirito
240271_15_a
Newbie or not, he'll lay into your
technique without hesitation. His
tips won't be level-appropriate.
Asuna
240271_14_a
His pointers will be clear and
concise
but also ultra-mega-uber
harsh and ridiculously advanced.
Asuna
240271_13_a
But, Yui, fair warning: Kirito's
advice is always right. Always
painfully, painfully right.
Asuna
240271_12_a
Ugh, fine...
Asuna
240271_11_a
See, Asuna? Even Yui says she
wants to hear what I have to say.
Kirito
240271_10_a
Now that I have the ability to
grow and get stronger, I want any
and all advice I can get!
Yui
240271_9_a
But, Mommy, Daddy looks like he
really wants to say something...
Yui
240271_8_a
Kirito
240271_7_a
Quiet, Kirito! Stay out of this!
Yui's my disciple, not yours!
Asuna
240271_6_a
Well, actually, I think that she
could have
Kirito
240271_5_a
Yeah, just like that.
That was a good swing, Yui.
Asuna
240271_4_a
Kirito
240271_3_a
Asuna
240271_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Hi-yah!

プレミアちゃんをパートナーに
したから、あっちの服が
報酬になったってことなんだね
リーファ
240268_15_a
なるほど、じゃああたしの場合は
アイングラウンドの住人である
リーファ
240268_14_a
変化する要因はパートナーとなる
NPCとの関連を元にシステムが
自動で決定していく……だって
リーファ
240268_13_a
あっ、説明文がある
えと……このクエストの報酬は
挑戦者によって変化する
リーファ
240268_12_a
う、うん……
でもなんでこれが……
リーファ
240268_11_a
あっ、それは……
アイングラウンドでリーファが
着ていた服ですよね?
プレミア

そうそう!
よし、じゃあそろそろ行こうか!
リーファ
240267_22_a
心が……軽く……
プレミア
240267_21_a
ふふっ、そういうことはね
心が軽くなったって言うんだよ
リーファ
240267_20_a
ありがとうございます……
そう言ってもらえて……
なんだかフワッとした気がします
プレミア
240267_19_a
プレミアちゃんと仲良く
冒険できたことが一番大切だって
思うから……
リーファ
240267_18_a
別にクエスト失敗したって
あたしは全然構わないよ
リーファ
240267_17_a
それにさっきも言ってたでしょ
これは楽しむことが大事
リーファ
240267_16_a
リーファ……
プレミア
240267_15_a
あなたはアイングラウンドにいた
ときよりもずっと強くなってるって
あたしは感じてるよ
リーファ
240267_14_a
その経験はあなたの身体に宿り、
血となり肉となってる
リーファ
240267_13_a
プレミアちゃんはこのALOに
来てから精一杯この世界について
学ぼうとしてきたでしょ?
リーファ
240267_12_a
プレミアちゃん
自信を持って
リーファ
240267_11_a
わたし一人では
きっとなにもできない……
プレミア
240267_10_a
ここまで来れたのは
全部リーファのおかげです
プレミア
240267_9_a
は、はい……
どんな試練が待っているのか……
少し不安です
プレミア
240267_8_a
ってことはここで
一旦お別れしなきゃダメなんだね
リーファ
240267_7_a
双方試練を乗り越えた先に
褒美を遣わそう……
リーファ
240267_6_a
試練を受ける旅人は右扉、
同行者は左扉に入り……
それぞれが試練を受ける
リーファ
240267_5_a
ちょっと説明読むね……
なになに……
リーファ
240267_4_a
前に二つの扉がありますね
どちらに行けばいいんでしょうか?
プレミア
240267_3_a
プレミア
240267_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
ここは……
リーファ
240267_1_a
うん!
そうだね!
リーファ
240265_34_a
さあ、攻略を続けましょう
プレミア
240265_33_a
リーファの顔を見ていたら
なんだか元気が出てきました
プレミア
240265_32_a
プレミアちゃん……
リーファ
240265_31_a
だからそんなに
楽しそうな笑顔を見せることが
できるんですね
プレミア
240265_30_a
それはリーファも同じ……
でもその大変なことでさえも、
リーファは楽しみに変えられる……
プレミア
240265_29_a
わたしはこのダンジョンの難しさを
少し辛く感じていたんですが……
プレミア
240265_28_a
リーファが前にこの世界を
楽しんでほしいと言ったことが
ようやくわかりました
プレミア
240265_27_a
えっ?
リーファ
240265_26_a
なるほど……そうだったんですね
プレミア
240265_25_a
リズさんやシリカちゃんにしても、
ほんとガチだからなぁ～
あはは……
リーファ
240265_24_a
内心冷や冷やしてるんだよ
リーファ
240265_23_a
あはは、ありがと
でもね、最近はみんながすごい勢いで
追い上げてきてるから
リーファ
240265_22_a
そうなんですね、この世界の
リーファはアイングラウンドで見た
ときよりも活き活きしています
プレミア
240265_21_a
でも一応キリト君たちよりも
先にALOを始めてたから
そういう経験値はあるつもりだよ
リーファ
240265_20_a
あはは……
そんな大層なものじゃないよ
リーファ
240265_19_a
それにアイテムの使用タイミングや
仲間に配慮するところも、
すべてが尊敬できます
プレミア
240265_18_a
リーファはすごいと思います
剣技や飛行技術だけではなく
魔法やダンジョン攻略の知識……
プレミア
240265_17_a
うん、一応これでも
仲間内じゃベテランだからね
リーファ
240265_16_a
でもリーファはこういうクエストを
何度もしてきたんですよね……
プレミア
240265_15_a
けっこうハードだったよね
これまでのALOの中でも
かなり上位の難易度を誇るよ、これは
リーファ
240265_14_a
は、はい……
でも……疲れました……
プレミア
240265_13_a
プレミアちゃん
お疲れさま、大丈夫?
リーファ
240265_12_a
はぁ……はぁ……
プレミア
240265_11_a
でりゃああっ!!
リーファ
240265_10_a
わ、わかりました……!
プレミア
240265_9_a
あたしが魔法で蹴散らすから
プレミアちゃんはこっちの
群れてるほうのMobをお願い!
リーファ
240265_8_a
で、ではどうすれば……
プレミア
240265_7_a
そのデカいのは剣の攻撃じゃ
ほとんどダメージを与えられない!
リーファ
240265_6_a
プレミアちゃん!
下がって!
リーファ
240265_5_a
あうっ……!
プレミア
240265_4_a
リーファ
240265_3_a
プレミア
240265_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
グオオオッ!!
モンスター
240265_1_a
うん!
リーファ
240263_26_a
その気持ちに応えるためにも
精一杯がんばりますね
プレミア
240263_25_a
そこまで考えてくれて
わたしも嬉しいです
プレミア
240263_24_a
リーファ……
わかりました
プレミア
240263_23_a
まぁそれでも後悔はしないよ
だってあたし、プレミアちゃんと
そのクエを楽しみたいんだもん!
リーファ
240263_22_a
あはは……やる前からそれは
なるべく考えたくないけど……
リーファ
240263_21_a
たとえそれでクエストを失敗すること
になっても……ですか?
プレミア
240263_20_a
そうだよ!
リーファ
240263_19_a
だからわたしをパートナーに
選んだんですか?
プレミア
240263_18_a
ぜひ体験して欲しいなって
思ったんだ
リーファ
240263_17_a
だからプレミアちゃんに
ALOの楽しさを知ってもらう
意味でも、
リーファ
240263_16_a
うん、飛行する必要もあるし、
魔法を使う場面もあるし
リーファ
240263_15_a
ALOらしい……?
プレミア
240263_14_a
でもね……あたし考えたの
このクエストって
すごくALOらしいなって
リーファ
240263_13_a
それなら尚更……
プレミア
240263_12_a
飛行可能なエリアがダンジョン内に
あって、そこで難しい飛行アクション
もする必要があるんだよ
リーファ
240263_11_a
敵が強いだけじゃなくて、
ダンジョンのギミックとかも
上級者向けで……
リーファ
240263_10_a
確かに今から行くクエストは
けっこう難しいんだ
リーファ
240263_9_a
ああっ
話は最後まで聞いてってば
リーファ
240263_8_a
それはやっぱり……
プレミア
240263_7_a
ストレアにお願いしようかと
思ってたんだ
リーファ
240263_6_a
うん、だからね
あたし最初はあなたじゃなくて
リーファ
240263_5_a
リーファたちの言う現実世界とは
違う世界の住人のことですよね
プレミア
240263_4_a
NPCとは……アイングラウンドや
アルヴヘイムの地で生きる者……
プレミア
240263_3_a
プレミア
240263_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
実はね
今回のクエストは同行者が
NPC一人って制限つきなんだ
リーファ
240263_1_a
わかりました……
プレミア
240261_17_a
でもこれはクエストに
行く途中で話そうかな
リーファ
240261_16_a
あはは……
実はね、これには理由があって……
リーファ
240261_15_a
せっかくならキリトやアスナなど
リーファと肩を並べる実力者に
頼めば良かったのではないかと……
プレミア
240261_14_a
確かに……そうですね
わたしはプレッシャーを
感じています
プレミア
240261_13_a
ああ、それはね
これからしなきゃいけないことが
大変そうだなって不安になることだよ
リーファ
240261_12_a
プレッシャー……?
それはどういうものですか?
プレミア
240261_11_a
ああ、ええと……
ごめんね、なんかプレッシャー
かけちゃったかな?
リーファ
240261_10_a
人数制限のあるクエストに
選ばれるとは
思いませんでした……
プレミア
240261_9_a
それはわたしはまだ
このALOに来たばかりです
まだ若輩者のわたしが
プレミア
240261_8_a
もちろん!
なんでそんなこと訊くの?
リーファ
240261_7_a
わたしでいいんですか……?
今回のクエストの同行者……
プレミア
240261_6_a
ん、どうしたの?
リーファ
240261_5_a
いえ……
でも……
プレミア
240261_4_a
あっ、プレミアちゃん!
来てくれてありがとう!
リーファ
240261_3_a
リーファ
240261_2_a
bg_21_alne
リーファ
プレミア
240261_1_a
You got it.
Rain
240258_27_a
Let's gather up these materials!
Seven
240258_26_a
Enough about all that, sis!
We're wasting our time!
Seven
240258_25_a
Ha ha, okay, fair point.
Rain
240258_24_a
Oh, stop it! I couldn't play it
even if I wanted to!
Seven
240258_23_a
You're not planning to avoid OS
just to spite her, are you?
Rain
240258_22_a
Ha ha! I can see the fire in
your eyes!
Rain
240258_21_a
It felt GREAT, actually!
Seven
240258_20_a
It felt pretty good to snub an
invitation from the snotty little
upstart who bumped my feature!
Seven
240258_19_a
What? Did I say something funny?
Rain
240258_18_a
Heh!
Seven
240258_17_a
Not to mention I'm trying to build
my career as a singer. I don't
have time for another game!
Rain
240258_16_a
I'll stick to ALO, thanks.
I love it too much to let
OS replace it.
Rain
240258_15_a
Ha ha, yeah, same here.
Rain
240258_14_a
Which doesn't put me in OS's
"play in the real world" target
market.
Seven
240258_13_a
Coming to Japan is like a business
trip for me. I mostly focus on
VR research while I'm here.
Seven
240258_12_a
Not really.
Seven
240258_11_a
Hmm...
Seven
240258_10_a
Well, what do you think?
Are you more interested in OS
after that little speech?
Rain
240258_9_a
It felt like it, but maybe she
was just speaking to no one
in particular.
Seven
240258_8_a
Was she talking to us just now?
Rain
240258_7_a
Rain
240258_6_a
bg_18_tower_road
...
Seven
240258_5_a
Yuna
240258_4_a
That was a very pleasant surprise.
Thank you for bearing with
us despite the change in program.
Host
240258_3_a
The AR idol Yuna, ladies and
gentlemen!
Host
240258_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Thank you, everyone! Good night!
Yuna
240258_1_a
bg_os_town_1
I really, really think you should
try playing in AR!
Yuna
240257_53_a
Seven
240257_52_a
bg_18_tower_road
Say what?!
Rain
240257_51_a
bg_os_town_1
Or, say, survivors of a certain
VR death game...
Yuna
240257_50_a
Rain
240257_49_a
bg_18_tower_road
What!
Seven
240257_48_a
bg_os_town_1
For instance, any scientists
researching the effects of VR on
players' psyches...
Yuna
240257_47_a
Seven
240257_46_a
bg_18_tower_road
The host seems caught off-guard...
Was this not in the script?
Rain
240257_45_a
Yuna
240257_44_a
Oh?
Host
240257_43_a
bg_os_town_1
Finally, I'd like to deliver a
message to the people I'd really
like to see play an AR game soon!
Yuna
240257_42_a
Seven
240257_41_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hah! I can feel the corporate
synergy from here.
Rain
240257_40_a
I sure do!
Yuna
240257_39_a
Yuna
240257_38_a
bg_os_town_1
I see! So you see AR and VR
coexisting? Evolving side-by-side?
Host
240257_37_a
Rain
240257_36_a
I know! I bet they fed the host
all these softball questions ahead
of time.
Seven
240257_35_a
Seven
240257_34_a
bg_18_tower_road
She's just outlining the current
technology. She hasn't even
answered the question-"why play?"
Rain
240257_33_a
of AR and VR will come from
understanding and using both.
Yuna
240257_32_a
Now they may sound similar, but
they're actually entirely
different. The real innovation...
Yuna
240257_31_a
But VRMMOs are entirely
virtual.
Yuna
240257_30_a
Well, AR games are set in virtual
worlds that are built inside the
real world...
Yuna
240257_29_a
And why is that?
Host
240257_28_a
But I'd really encourage you all
to make the switch to AR and
try out Ordinal Scale!
Yuna
240257_27_a
bg_os_town_1
Now I believe most of you watching
tonight are all VRMMO players.
Yuna
240257_26_a
Seven
240257_25_a
Seven, she, um...
She can't hear you.
Rain
240257_24_a
Rain
240257_23_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hmph! This better be the most
compelling thing I've ever heard!
You've shelved my feature for it!
Seven
240257_22_a
bg_os_town_1
And I'm here to tell you all about
what makes OS so compelling!
Yuna
240257_21_a
Seven
240257_20_a
Her speech is really natural.
Rain
240257_19_a
Why shouldn't they? She seems
to be an actual player, at least.
Rain
240257_18_a
Rain
240257_17_a
bg_18_tower_road
I mean, why is MMO Tomorrow even
covering an AR game?!
Seven
240257_16_a
Hello everyone! Yuna here.
I'm the idol of Ordinal Scale!
Yuna
240257_15_a
Yuna
240257_14_a
bg_os_town_1
Yuna has a big announcement about
OS, and I'm told she will also be
performing live for us tonight!
Host
240257_13_a
Rain
240257_12_a
GRRRR! Why is THIS little brat on
the show instead of the feature
about ME?!
Seven
240257_11_a
bg_18_tower_road
Uh oh...
Rain
240257_9_a
Seven
240257_10_a
Good evening, everyone!
Yuna
240257_8_a
the lovely and talented Yuna!!
Host
240257_7_a
I believe we have a connection,
so please join me in welcoming
the idol of Ordinal Scale...
Host
240257_6_a
bg_os_town_1
We've had to shuffle some things
around to make time for a
VERY special guest!
Host
240257_5_a
Rain
240257_4_a
bg_18_tower_road
Are you kidding me?!
Seven
240257_3_a
I want to remind you that today's
big story has been changed.
Host
240257_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Now before we get started,
Host
240257_1_a
Okay!
Rain
240255_17_a
Yeah! Let's turn it on right now!
Seven
240255_16_a
Wow, really?
Rain
240255_15_a
The daily MMO Tomorrow video is
going to do a feature on my
research!
Seven
240255_14_a
Oh, by the way!
Seven
240255_13_a
Y-Yeah!
Seven
240255_12_a
We should be enjoying ALO while
we're here!
Rain
240255_11_a
You'll be back in Japan before
I know it, like you said.
Rain
240255_10_a
Sorry, there I go bringing the
mood down again.
Rain
240255_9_a
Yeah... Don't remind me of that
either.
Seven
240255_8_a
It'd be nice if you could play
ALO in the States, though...
Rain
240255_7_a
Besides, I'll be able to come back
soon anyway! Geez.
Seven
240255_6_a
Shhh! Don't remind me!
Seven
240255_5_a
You only have a few days left in
Japan, don't you?
Rain
240255_4_a
Okay, we should be able to get a
bunch of materials here.
Seven
240255_3_a
Seven
240255_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Let's just collect some materials
then.
Rain
240255_1_a
Okay, okay... I get it.
Rain
240253_20_a
NO! My pride won't allow it!
Seven
240253_19_a
Can't you play it casually just to
see what it's all about?
Rain
240253_18_a
I'm not giving up on it!
Seven
240253_17_a
No way! I poured all of my
time and resources into
researching VR for a reason!
Seven
240253_16_a
You know, I've heard that Asuna
and the others are playing OS...
Maybe we should try it?
Rain
240253_15_a
Hahaha, still hung up on that,
are we?
Rain
240253_14_a
Go back to reality and start
playing OS if you love her
so much!!
Seven
240253_13_a
Everywhere we go it's "Yuna this!"
and "Ooh, Yuna that!"
Seven
240253_12_a
Yeah, she's great either way!
Player B
240253_11_a
Really? I mean, I guess it
doesn't really matter.
Player A
240253_10_a
I dunno. I've heard rumors that
she's an AI-controlled NPC!
Player B
240253_9_a
She's gotta be player-controlled.
No NPC could speak or move
so naturally!
Player A
240253_8_a
She's the best I've ever seen!
Player B
240253_7_a
She's got such cool moves!
And a great voice too!
Player B
240253_6_a
She's adorable!
Player A
240253_5_a
Yeah! That's Ordinal Scale's idol,
right? Yuna!
Player B
240253_4_a
Seven
240253_3_a
Rain
240253_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Did you see that?!
Player A
240253_1_a
And that's why I'm mad!
Seven
240251_19_a
Well, a game that gives you such
an impressive sense of presence
is undeniably attractive.
Rain
240251_18_a
No one would even notice if I
started performing again.
Seven
240251_17_a
Daily logins to ALO have fallen
off a cliff.
Seven
240251_16_a
Ordinal Scale fever is sweeping
the nation!
Seven
240251_15_a
No way! Everyone's playing these
AR games now.
Seven
240251_14_a
Can't you just come out of
retirement or something?
Rain
240251_13_a
She's got it so good...
Singing and dancing...
Everyone fawning over her...
Seven
240251_12_a
I was never really into games...
This whole idol thing was your...
Never mind.
Rain
240251_11_a
We quit being idols, and now all
anyone cares about is this girl!
Seven
240251_10_a
But doesn't it suck, sis?
Seven
240251_9_a
Pull yourself together, Seven.
Rain
240251_8_a
Rain
240251_7_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!
Seven
240251_6_a
Yuna
240251_5_a
YEAAAAAAAH!
Audience
240251_4_a
Then it's time for the next song!
Here we go!
Yuna
240251_3_a
WOOOOO!
Audience
240251_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Hey everybody! Are you having a
good time out there?!
Yuna
240251_1_a
Thank you, Sakuya!
Leafa
240248_25_a
Just try not to go overboard...
Sakuya
240248_24_a
Of course, your contributions
to the Sylph race are to be
commended.
Sakuya
240248_23_a
Got it.
Leafa
240248_22_a
Try to be level-headed next time.
Sakuya
240248_21_a
Although we were able to win
this tournament, I cannot in good
conscience approve of your methods.
Sakuya
240248_20_a
Hm... Very well.
Now then, Leafa...
Sakuya
240248_19_a
So, I'd really appreciate it if
you could keep a more open mind,
Sakuya.
Kirito
240248_18_a
So I understand why she'd want
to play OS. There, she gets to
physically move around.
Kirito
240248_17_a
W-Well, Sug-er Leafa plays
sports in real life, doesn't she?
Kirito
240248_16_a
...I see.
What about you, Kirito?
What do you think?
Sakuya
240248_15_a
I want to be committed to both.
They're so much fun, but in
different ways...
Leafa
240248_14_a
Wh-What are you talking about?!
I haven't quit playing ALO!
Leafa
240248_13_a
I suppose I shouldn't hold out
any hope of getting one of my
top warriors back...
Sakuya
240248_12_a
My my... You certainly are
quite passionate about OS, aren't
you, Leafa?
Sakuya
240248_11_a
Plus, I wanted to show them
that OS is just as fun as ALO.
Leafa
240248_10_a
I-I know... But I couldn't just
sit around and watch the
Sylphs lose like that.
Leafa
240248_9_a
but they can still see what you
look like. They could find out
who you really are.
Kirito
240248_8_a
The Augma can prevent your
opponent from seeing your
facial expressions,
Kirito
240248_7_a
You're lucky they were reasonable.
I don't even want to think what
could have happened to you.
Kirito
240248_6_a
Hehe.
Hey, I won, didn't I?
Leafa
240248_5_a
Leafa...
I can't believe you...
Sakuya
240248_4_a
Leafa
240248_3_a
Sakuya
240248_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
Geez...
Kirito
240248_1_a
Rgh... Take her down!
Female OS Player
240247_18_a
Pile on, if you wanna stop me!
Leafa
240247_17_a
Wha...? Those movements!
Who ARE you?!
Female OS Player
240247_16_a
One down!
Leafa
240247_15_a
Huh?! I'm already out of HP?!
How did she...?
Player
240247_14_a
Hiiiyaaah!
Leafa
240247_13_a
I bet it never occurred to you
that I'd be just as strong in
real life!
Leafa
240247_12_a
Huh?
Female OS Player
240247_11_a
It's just too bad you
underestimated me!
Leafa
240247_10_a
The conditions are the same.
Ten of you against one of us!
Leafa
240247_9_a
I was the last one standing in
ALO, remember?
Leafa
240247_8_a
Hmph... I believe you.
I half-expected an ambush,
but here you are.
Female OS Player
240247_7_a
Of course!
I believe in fair fights.
Leafa
240247_6_a
Well, aren't you a cocky one! But
at least you had the nerve to face
me in person.
Female OS Player
240247_5_a
Nope. But my voice is the same,
so you'd be able to tell if you
talked to me.
Leafa
240247_4_a
Though, as we've turned off facial
expressions, it's not as if I'd
recognize you anyway.
Female OS Player
240247_3_a
Heh... So this is what one of
the top Sylphs looks like in
real life.
Female OS Player
240247_2_a
bg_os_town_1
Time for battle!
Leafa
240247_1_a
Hehehe...
Leafa
240245_33_a
...
Leafa
240245_32_a
W-Will do...
Leafa
240245_31_a
Prepare to be slaughtered!
Female Salamander
240245_30_a
I'll talk to my superiors about
settling this outside of the
game.
Female Salamander
240245_29_a
Alright. I accept your challenge.
Though this isn't part of
the tournament's rules...
Female Salamander
240245_28_a
Of all the nerve... Hmph. Fine.
I get what you're doing.
Female Salamander
240245_27_a
I'm REALLY strong in OS.
I could destroy an army
of you guys all by myself!
Leafa
240245_26_a
What...?
Female Salamander
240245_25_a
sigh
If only this were OS!
We wouldn't lose to the likes
of you!
Leafa
240245_24_a
So don't think you can blame a
different game for this pathetic
state of affairs.
Female Salamander
240245_23_a
OS...? Oh, right, that AR game.
We Salamanders have been playing
it too.
Female Salamander
240245_22_a
Not as if this matters, but
the Sylphs really have all
been playing OS lately.
Leafa
240245_21_a
sigh
The truth is...you're right.
Leafa
240245_20_a
Hm? What is it?
Female Salamander
240245_19_a
Oh, yeah...
Leafa
240245_18_a
...
Leafa
240245_17_a
This turnout's just pathetic.
Female Salamander
240245_16_a
Hehe, I guess the rumors were
true. You Sylphs are too obsessed
with AR to even show up.
Female Salamander
240245_15_a
Ugh... Ten versus one?
This isn't good...
Leafa
240245_14_a
You're the last Sylph left
around here! I'd suggest
you surrender!
Female Salamander
240245_13_a
No, Leafa! Waaaait!
Recon
240245_12_a
Well, I'll see you later.
Leafa
240245_11_a
Wh-What...?
Recon
240245_10_a
It's kind of ridiculous,
considering you can come
back in a second.
Leafa
240245_9_a
Recon...
Geez... You don't have
to be so melodramatic.
Leafa
240245_8_a
L-Leafa... Promise me you'll
keep smiling...even after I'm
long gone...
Recon
240245_7_a
Yes!
One down, one to go!
Female Salamander
240245_6_a
Gah!!
Recon
240245_5_a
Recon!
Leafa
240245_4_a
Recon
240245_3_a
Leafa
240245_2_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Yah!
Female Salamander
240245_1_a
Leafa... Thank you.
Sakuya
240243_20_a
Now I'm getting pumped! I'll
show them how strong Sylphs
can be, even in a losing fight!
Leafa
240243_19_a
If we're expected to lose anyway,
I might as well have fun.
Leafa
240243_18_a
Gah, don't worry about it!
No need to be so risky for
just an event!
Leafa
240243_17_a
If we are unable to entice any
more Sylphs to join us, I fully
intend to participate myself.
Sakuya
240243_16_a
And you still want to participate?
Well, I guess all the other races
will be there and you ARE a lord.
Leafa
240243_15_a
We're more than guaranteed to be
at a considerable disadvantage...
Sakuya
240243_14_a
That is, indeed, a problem...
In fact, I'm quite sure we'll
be vastly outnumbered...
Sakuya
240243_13_a
Sure, but I'm just one person.
How are you going to get more
people?
Leafa
240243_12_a
I'd rather not wait around. So,
Leafa, would you be willing to
join the tournament?
Sakuya
240243_11_a
...Though I guess I'm in no
position to talk, ha ha.
Leafa
240243_10_a
Once the initial popularity dies
down, people will be back to ALO
in no time!
Leafa
240243_9_a
Well, you know what? I'm
sure the Augma and OS are
just fads right now, anyway.
Leafa
240243_8_a
At the same time, though, I'm not
an admin, and it's not as if the
players owe me any allegiance.
Sakuya
240243_7_a
As a lord, I should be providing
a superior gaming experience
for all players in my territory.
Sakuya
240243_6_a
No...
You don't need to apologize.
Sakuya
240243_5_a
S-Sorry 'bout that, Sakuya.
Leafa
240243_4_a
But I had hoped it was just
my imagination...
Sakuya
240243_3_a
Leafa
240243_2_a
bg_20_swilvane
sigh
I knew it. I had a
feeling you might be
playing it too...
Sakuya
240243_1_a
Ha...ha ha...
Th-That's odd...
Leafa
240241_23_a
What?!
Leafa
240241_22_a
because they're so hooked
on Ordinal Scale...
Sakuya
240241_21_a
Many of the top Sylphs have
taken a break from ALO
Sakuya
240241_20_a
Well...
There's a reason for that...
Sakuya
240241_19_a
S-So why...?
Leafa
240241_18_a
Whaat?! But that tournament's so
popular that we normally have to
pick the participants by lottery!
Leafa
240241_17_a
We don't have enough Sylph
participants this time around...
Sakuya
240241_16_a
You know those player-organized,
race-vs-race tournaments that
we hold from time to time?
Sakuya
240241_15_a
Huh?
Leafa
240241_14_a
I know this is truly going to
sound pathetic...
Sakuya
240241_13_a
Well...
Actually...
Sakuya
240241_12_a
So, Sakuya, what's the problem?
Leafa
240241_11_a
bg_20_swilvane
Glad to see you, Leafa.
Sakuya
240241_9_a
Leafa
240241_10_a
Uh, okay...
Kazuto
240241_8_a
Well, I'd better get going!
Suguha
240241_7_a
No, apparently the problem
only affects Sylphs!
Suguha
240241_6_a
An emergency...?
Should I come too?
Kazuto
240241_5_a
Sakuya just messaged me.
There's been an emergency!
I have to log into ALO!
Suguha
240241_4_a
Hm?
What's the matter, Sugu?
Kazuto
240241_3_a
Kazuto
240241_2_a
bg_15_kirigaya_dojo
O-Oh no!
Suguha
240241_1_a
Alice...
Kirito
240198_42_a
Kirito
240198_41_a
Let this be engraved on your
mind. Understood?
Alice
240198_40_a
I have no intention whatsoever
of getting to know you.
Alice
240198_39_a
...?
Kirito
240198_38_a
...How many times do I need
to make myself clear?
Alice
240198_37_a
We're here for you and Eugeo...
We're your friends!
Kirito
240198_36_a
A-And if there's anything you
don't understand, you can always
ask me!
Kirito
240198_35_a
Alice...
Kirito
240198_34_a
But unless I assume you're
telling the truth, I'll never be
able to find the Divine Objects.
Alice
240198_33_a
Ever since I set foot in this
world, I've been bewildered
by everything.
Alice
240198_32_a
T-Taboo Index...? Uh...yeah.
It's probably something like that.
Kirito
240198_31_a
Yes. I can understand it if
I think of it in terms of
our world's Taboo Index.
Alice
240198_30_a
That's it.
So do you believe me?
Kirito
240198_29_a
That must be why those gawkers
from earlier were so foolhardy.
Alice
240198_28_a
They command that you spend
your lives half in duty and
half in play.
Alice
240198_27_a
As the gods are able to restore
the lives of those who perish
in this world...
Alice
240198_26_a
And lastly...
Alice
240198_25_a
It is not possible to fight
within areas you call
"safe zones."
Alice
240198_24_a
You build bonds of camaraderie
through joining "guilds" and
adding "friends."
Alice
240198_23_a
You are chosen to receive missions
from the gods, which you call
"quests."
Alice
240198_22_a
One is that you must periodically
leave this world.
Alice
240198_21_a
All people in this world
are bound by certain rules.
Alice
240198_20_a
I see... So, in other words,
it boils down to this:
Alice
240198_19_a
...and that about covers it.
Or at least, a very abridged
version of it.
Kirito
240198_18_a
Okay...
I'll explain everything.
Kirito
240198_17_a
...
Alice
240198_16_a
But it looks like that just
left you and Eugeo even more
confused.
Kirito
240198_15_a
I'm sorry. We only wanted to
do the right thing by you...
Kirito
240198_14_a
...
Kirito
240198_13_a
And at this rate, I'll never achieve
my goal and return home...
Alice
240198_12_a
There are just too many things
I don't understand about
this world.
Alice
240198_11_a
Even if you think you're
doing it for my sake
and Eugeo's...
Alice
240198_10_a
I had already realized that
you're hiding something from
me, you know.
Alice
240198_9_a
Th-That's
Kirito
240198_8_a
Even now, the Forces of Darkness
these creatures you call monsters
threaten to lay waste to your world!
Alice
240198_7_a
They spoke as if they thought this
world were just a silly game!
Reckless, foolish hedonists!
Alice
240198_6_a
Kirito... What in the world
were they thinking?
Alice
240198_5_a
Alice...?
Kirito
240198_4_a
...
Alice
240198_3_a
Alice
240198_2_a
bg_event_alne_field_sunset
Phew...
It looks like they gave up.
Kirito
240198_1_a
...!
Alice
240197_39_a
You have to leave the city
limits before you can fight!
Kirito
240197_38_a
There she is! Surround her!
Before she makes a break
for the exit!
Male Player A
240197_37_a
It's known as a safe zone...
So I'm trying to tell you that...
Kirito
240197_36_a
What are you saying?
Alice
240197_35_a
In this world...
you can't fight there...
Not inside the city.
Kirito
240197_34_a
Erm...
How do I put this...?
Kirito
240197_33_a
So naturally, I prepared to
unleash the fearsome power of
the Integrity Knights.
Alice
240197_32_a
Well, I couldn't sit quietly and
allow them to treat me like an
exotic novelty on display!
Alice
240197_31_a
What do you mean, "why"...?
Isn't it obvious?!
Kirito
240197_30_a
Kirito
240197_29_a
bg_event_alne_field
Kirito!
Why are we running?!
Alice
240197_28_a
After her!
Female Player A
240197_27_a
Hey!
Sh-She's getting away!
Male Player A
240197_26_a
Kirito
240197_25_a
Wha
Alice
240197_24_a
I-It doesn't matter!
Let's just get out of here!
Kirito
240197_23_a
Kirito, what are you saying?!
Alice
240197_22_a
And she's still kind of a newbie
here! Sorry for letting her
cause such a ruckus!
Kirito
240197_21_a
Alice
240197_20_a
S-Sorry about this!
She's our friend!
Kirito
240197_19_a
Huh?
Alice
240197_18_a
Whoa there!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!!
???
240197_17_a
I am one of the illustrious
Integrity Knights...
Alice
240197_16_a
Isn't it obvious I have no
business with you? Don't
you realize who I am?
Alice
240197_15_a
I already told you... I don't know
what you're talking about!
Alice
240197_14_a
Whoa!
Male Player A
240197_13_a
Take THAT!
Alice
240197_12_a
I thought those pictures were
shopped! Awesome! This is a seriously
big deal!
Female Player A
240197_11_a
Now that you mention it...yeah!
Wow, imagine meeting her in a
place like this!
Male Player A
240197_10_a
You were in that MMO Tomorrow
article! You beat Jotunheimr
all on your own, right?!
Male Player B
240197_9_a
Wait a minute...
I recognize that avatar!
Male Player B
240197_8_a
...
Alice
240197_7_a
No way!
Join our guild!
It's way better!
Female Player C
240197_6_a
Wanna join our guild?
Male Player D
240197_5_a
Are you in a guild yet?
Female Player C
240197_4_a
Add you to what?
Alice
240197_3_a
Alice
240197_2_a
bg_21_alne
Hey! Add me? Pleeeaase?
Female Player A
240197_1_a
Seriously, tell me how to do that!
Male Player B
240195_40_a
Can I introduce you to some
of my guild members? Come
on! They're this way!
Male Player A
240195_39_a
Hey! What kinds of customization
settings did you use?
Female Player B
240195_38_a
Hmm? Now that I've got a good
look at you, you're not a fairy,
are you?
Male Player A
240195_37_a
What are you talking about?
Boorish folk. Leave me be...
Alice
240195_36_a
Wow, that's so cool! You look
like when Eowyn fought the
Lord of the Nazgul!
Female Player A
240195_35_a
...
Alice
240195_34_a
Whoa! That equipment's
rarity must be off the charts!
Male Player A
240195_33_a
They're all fairies here...
Not a single human in sight.
Alice
240195_32_a
bg_21_alne
So this is what an
Alfheim city is like...
Alice
240195_31_a
Sinon
240195_30_a
R-Right!
Leafa
240195_29_a
Asuna
240195_28_a
Jeez... We can talk about
this later. Let's get going!
Kirito
240195_27_a
She must have been waiting
for the right moment to run off
and search for the Divine Objects.
Asuna
240195_26_a
Kirito
240195_25_a
It's okay, you two.
Don't blame yourselves.
Asuna
240195_24_a
Leafa
240195_23_a
Th-Then it's just as much
my fault too...
Sinon
240195_22_a
Sinon
240195_21_a
I-I'm s-sorry, Kirito... This never
would've happened if I'd been
paying proper attention...
Leafa
240195_20_a
Asuna
240195_19_a
Us three will go find Alice!
Kirito
240195_18_a
Asuna
240195_17_a
Urgh... Dammit! Alright, Sinon.
You stay in the house and keep
an eye on Eugeo!
Kirito
240195_16_a
Leafa
240195_15_a
He's still in the house! And she
didn't take Amayori, so Alice
couldn't have gone far.
Sinon
240195_14_a
Kirito
240195_13_a
What about Eugeo?!
Asuna
240195_12_a
Sinon
240195_11_a
We let our guard down for a
second, and she just dashed
right out of the house!
Leafa
240195_10_a
Asuna
240195_9_a
Huh?! How?! You and Sugu were
supposed to keep an eye on them!
Kirito
240195_8_a
Leafa
240195_7_a
Alice is gone!!
Sinon
240195_6_a
Asuna
240195_5_a
What's wrong, Sinon?
Kirito
240195_4_a
Asuna
240195_3_a
Kirito
240195_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Kirito, Asuna!
It's an emergency!
Sinon
240195_1_a
Okay. Got it.
Asuna
240193_38_a
Instead of making them
uncomfortable all the time,
let's just try to avoid it.
Kirito
240193_37_a
Whatever world Alice and Eugeo
come from, it seems like they don't
understand those kinds of words.
Kirito
240193_36_a
Let's not use game terminology or
internet slang in front of them.
Kirito
240193_35_a
There is one other thing I want
you to be careful about.
Kirito
240193_34_a
Yeah...
Asuna
240193_33_a
So until they return to their
world, all we can do is try
to help them.
Kirito
240193_32_a
That's the understanding we're
going with, anyway.
Kirito
240193_31_a
Asuna
240193_30_a
I mentioned this to Asuna before,
but we've just met a couple of people
from another world and timeline.
Kirito
240193_29_a
Leafa
240193_28_a
It seems like Alice wants to get
out and track down the Divine
Objects as soon as possible...
Sinon
240193_27_a
Leafa
240193_26_a
Are they gonna be okay?
Sinon
240193_25_a
Asuna
240193_24_a
Yikes, that's true! Still, I don't
think they'll be found as long
as they stay indoors.
Kirito
240193_23_a
those two are sure to build up
a following here. Whether they
like it or not...
Asuna
240193_22_a
Once word spreads that there
are super-strong mystery players
on the scene,
Asuna
240193_21_a
Kirito
240193_20_a
That...doesn't sound good.
Asuna
240193_19_a
Sinon
240193_18_a
Now they're even trying to
track her movements and
share information on her.
Leafa
240193_17_a
Sinon
240193_16_a
Ever since that article was posted,
a lot of players have gotten curious
about Alice.
Leafa
240193_15_a
Asuna
240193_14_a
What do you mean, Sugu?
Kirito
240193_13_a
Sinon
240193_12_a
I'm not so sure about that.
Leafa
240193_11_a
Right... At least they can finally
catch up on some rest.
Sinon
240193_9_a
Leafa
240193_10_a
Kirito
240193_8_a
Then before you know it,
you're fighting in one fierce
battle after another.
Asuna
240193_7_a
I'll say. Just imagine being
suddenly thrown into a
completely unknown world...
Asuna
240193_6_a
They must've been exhausted.
Now they've finally got a chance
to relax and take stock of things.
Kirito
240193_5_a
Asuna
240193_4_a
They're taking it easy
at our place for now.
Kirito
240193_3_a
Leafa
240193_2_a
bg_11_home_veranda
Hey, Kirito...
How are those two doing?
Sinon
240193_1_a
Doesn't look like I really
have a choice...
Alice
240191_97_a
I see. In that case, could you
give me a lift up there?
Eugeo
240191_96_a
Eugeo
240191_95_a
I guess I could travel up
there on Amayori...
Alice
240191_94_a
Sinon
240191_93_a
Asuna
240191_92_a
What'd we tell you?
We're all fairies here...
We fly up there.
Kirito
240191_91_a
Alice
240191_90_a
But how are we supposed to
get up somewhere that high?
Eugeo
240191_89_a
Sinon
240191_88_a
Asuna
240191_87_a
So if you two are gonna be in
this world for a while, why not
use our house as a base?
Kirito
240191_86_a
Sinon
240191_85_a
Asuna
240191_84_a
Phew... Good.
In that case...
Kirito
240191_83_a
Eugeo
240191_82_a
Very well, then...
I suppose Amayori could
do with a rest.
Alice
240191_81_a
Sinon
240191_80_a
Asuna
240191_79_a
H-Hey. Doesn't she look hungry?
Kirito
240191_78_a
Eugeo
240191_77_a
Alice
240191_76_a
Ggrruu!
Amayori
240191_75_a
Eugeo
240191_74_a
...
Alice
240191_73_a
Sinon
240191_72_a
Asuna
240191_71_a
It'll just take a second to
prepare something... Don't
you want to try it out?
Kirito
240191_70_a
A friend of ours here has a little
dragon! She'll know all about
what you can feed yours.
Kirito
240191_69_a
Sinon
240191_68_a
Asuna
240191_67_a
But, um... Er, the thing is...
I got it!
Kirito
240191_66_a
Eugeo
240191_65_a
I can search for them myself.
Alice
240191_64_a
Sinon
240191_63_a
Asuna
240191_62_a
B-But you'll need our help to find
the other Divine Objects, right?
Kirito
240191_61_a
Eugeo
240191_60_a
I can take care of myself.
Alice
240191_59_a
Sinon
240191_58_a
Asuna
240191_57_a
But... Erm... Do you really think that's
a good idea? There are so many things
you don't know about this world...
Kirito
240191_56_a
Sinon
240191_55_a
Asuna
240191_54_a
H-Hey, wait!
Kirito
240191_53_a
Eugeo
240191_52_a
I'm afraid your hospitality won't
be necessary.
Alice
240191_51_a
Eugeo
240191_50_a
Much as I appreciate your kindness,
I don't intend on spending the
time to get to know you.
Alice
240191_49_a
Sinon
240191_48_a
Asuna
240191_47_a
Yep! You'll see it yourself when
you and Eugeo come to
stay with us.
Kirito
240191_46_a
Eugeo
240191_45_a
You live in a place like that?
Alice
240191_44_a
Sinon
240191_43_a
Kirito
240191_42_a
That's the floating castle Aincrad.
Our home is up there.
Asuna
240191_41_a
Eugeo
240191_40_a
That enormous fortress
hanging in the sky...
Alice
240191_39_a
Kirito
240191_38_a
Asuna
240191_37_a
Ah, that makes sense.
Sinon
240191_36_a
They could be from dimensions
with slightly different parameters...
Parallel universes, in other words.
Kirito
240191_35_a
After all, Alice said she's
never met Eugeo before.
Which could mean...
Kirito
240191_34_a
Those two are both Integrity Knights,
but that doesn't necessarily mean they're
from the same world.
Kirito
240191_33_a
Kirito
240191_32_a
Asuna
240191_31_a
What do you mean?
Sinon
240191_30_a
Eugeo
240191_29_a
Well... That's assuming you and
I even come from the same world.
Alice
240191_28_a
Of course not. In our world, there
are only humans and the Forces
of Darkness.
Alice
240191_27_a
There's nothing like this in the
world I come from... At least,
I don't think so.
Eugeo
240191_26_a
It's amazing...
All this time I thought fairies
only existed in children's stories.
Eugeo
240191_25_a
Alice
240191_24_a
You use those wings
on your back to fly, right?
Eugeo
240191_23_a
Sinon
240191_22_a
Kirito
240191_21_a
Yeah.
Asuna
240191_20_a
Eugeo
240191_19_a
Can all fairies fly like that?
Alice
240191_18_a
Sinon
240191_17_a
Kirito
240191_16_a
There are nine different races of
fairies, and they each have their
own region.
Asuna
240191_15_a
Sinon
240191_14_a
Asuna
240191_13_a
Oh! Those are fairies.
Well, technically, everyone living
in this world is a fairy.
Kirito
240191_12_a
Eugeo
240191_11_a
All those people...
They're floating in the air!
Alice
240191_10_a
What is it, Amayori?
Whoa!
Alice
240191_9_a
Grroouuh!
Amayori
240191_8_a
I can hardly believe it... There
was a whole world all the way up
here above our own...
Alice
240191_7_a
Wow...
It's really just like
you guys said!
Eugeo
240191_6_a
Eugeo
240191_5_a
So this...is the surface?
Alice
240191_4_a
Sinon
240191_3_a
Asuna
240191_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Well, Alice, Eugeo...
This is the land of Alfheim.
Kirito
240191_1_a
Ahaha, totally!
Leafa
240188_19_a
Ha ha, yeah. It feels like we
just passed some sort of test
and graduated ninja school.
Kirito
240188_18_a
Yeah! This quest was definitely
meant to train us in the way
of the ninja!
Leafa
240188_17_a
I guess... I'm sure we'll have to
hide again like we did for this
quest, and in the Legrue Corridor.
Kirito
240188_16_a
Hehe, right? But I'm sure it'll
come in handy in the future too.
Leafa
240188_15_a
What the heck? That would have
been nice to have before we
did this quest!
Kirito
240188_14_a
It says equipping it increases
your hiding abilities.
Leafa
240188_13_a
item_event_kunoichi_leafa
Hey, we get an item
called Kunoichi!
Leafa
240188_12_a
So let's see...
Leafa
240188_11_a
Ha ha, gotcha.
Kirito
240188_10_a
I wasn't thinking about any
actual quest reward.
Leafa
240188_9_a
Well, for me, getting to sneak
into a castle was reward enough
in and of itself.
Leafa
240188_8_a
Y-You didn't?
But then why...?
Kirito
240188_7_a
Oh yeah. I never did check...
Leafa
240188_6_a
That reminds me... Was there
any sort of reward for this?
Kirito
240188_5_a
That's one more quest done!
Leafa
240188_4_a
Nice job, Sugu.
Kirito
240188_3_a
Kirito
240188_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle_inside
Yay! We did it!
This treasure is ours!
Leafa
240188_1_a
Kirito
240187_25_a
Sure thing!
Leafa
240187_24_a
We're almost there...
Come on, Sugu!
Kirito
240187_23_a
That has to be the treasure room
we saw on the map!
Leafa
240187_22_a
Ah, hey! Kazuto, there's light
coming from over there!
Leafa
240187_21_a
N-Now that you mention it...
Yeah, it was.
Kirito
240187_20_a
Oh yeah, you're right... That was
before we knew who each other
actually was, huh?
Leafa
240187_19_a
We had to hide from the
Salamanders chasing us then too.
Kirito
240187_18_a
Yeah. You know, now that I think
about it, it's kind of like back
in the Legrue Corridor.
Kirito
240187_17_a
it's still possible to have this
kind of thing in the same game.
I love VR!
Leafa
240187_16_a
Hehe, totally. Even though ALO
is pretty combat-centric,
Leafa
240187_15_a
Talk about an adrenaline rush.
Who knew just sneaking around
could be this much of a thrill?
Kirito
240187_14_a
And throwing pebbles to make a
noise to distract them while you
run right by.
Kirito
240187_13_a
Hiding underwater while your
enemies walk by, oblivious to your
presence...
Leafa
240187_12_a
Yeah. Sneaking in through the
sewers, finding hidden doors...
Leafa
240187_11_a
You know, this is kind of fun...
Trying not to be seen adds a whole
other layer of excitement to it...
Kirito
240187_10_a
I-I know that!
Leafa
240187_9_a
Don't yell, Sugu! The samurai
will hear you!
Kirito
240187_8_a
Excuses, excuses!
Leafa
240187_7_a
bg_s2_11_cave
M-My bad... It's just so dark,
and there's not much space
to move around...
Kirito
240187_6_a
K-Kazuto, watch where you're
putting your hands!
Leafa
240187_5_a
Huh?
Kirito
240187_4_a
Kirito
240187_3_a
Hngaaaah!
Leafa
240187_2_a
...
Kirito
240187_1_a
Kirito
240185_24_a
Got it!
Leafa
240185_23_a
Let's look around for some other
way of getting in.
Kirito
240185_22_a
So that rules out just waltzing in
through the main gate.
Leafa
240185_21_a
It's probably to keep you from
realizing right away that you have
to stay hidden.
Kirito
240185_20_a
Yeah. Kind of an underhanded move,
though, since in theory you COULD
beat them.
Kirito
240185_19_a
Ahh, okay. So those mobs are
designed to be pretty much
impossible to defeat.
Leafa
240185_18_a
That's how we get through this
quest.
Kirito
240185_17_a
and get past those samurai guards
and grab the treasure all without
being seen.
Kirito
240185_16_a
Yeah. I'm pretty sure we're going
to have to make like a ninja,
Kirito
240185_15_a
Oh! Ninjas!
Leafa
240185_14_a
Whose job is it to sneak into
castles like this and steal
stuff without being detected?
Kirito
240185_13_a
Uh... I dunno...
Leafa
240185_12_a
Think about it. What's the first
image that comes to mind when you
hear the word "sneak"?
Kirito
240185_11_a
What is?
Leafa
240185_10_a
Oh... That has to be it...
Kirito
240185_9_a
We shouldn't be hitting a wall
of mobs that tough right from the
get-go...
Kirito
240185_8_a
I know. That's what's not right...
Kirito
240185_7_a
But there's no info anywhere about
anything we're supposed to do
before we sneak into the castle...
Leafa
240185_6_a
You mean our approach is wrong?
Leafa
240185_5_a
Yeah... Something isn't right...
Kirito
240185_4_a
That was close...
Leafa
240185_3_a
Leafa
240185_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle
Phew...
Kirito
240185_1_a
Kirito
240183_32_a
Y-Yeah!
Leafa
240183_31_a
Sugu, we have to retreat!
This is bad!
Kirito
240183_30_a
Attaaack!
Samurai
240183_29_a
Maybe there's no way we can
fight our way through them...
Kirito
240183_28_a
Their HP is ridiculously high...
Leafa
240183_27_a
Wh-What's with these guys?
They're not that strong, but...
Kirito
240183_26_a
Now, after them!
Samurai
240183_25_a
A reward for whomever parts
these knaves' heads from their
shoulders!
Samurai
240183_24_a
K-Kazuto! Are you okay?!
Leafa
240183_23_a
Hnggg!
Kirito
240183_22_a
Y-Yeah!
Leafa
240183_21_a
You're right. Guess we've got
a fight on our hands!
Kirito
240183_20_a
See! More samurai are coming!
Leafa
240183_19_a
This isn't really the time to
joke around, Kazuto!
Leafa
240183_18_a
Ha ha, it's like he's straight out
of a period play or something.
Kirito
240183_17_a
Leafa
240183_16_a
Kirito
240183_15_a
Villains! Intruders!
En garde!
Samurai
240183_14_a
He must be one of the evil lord's
retainers....
Kirito
240183_13_a
Y-Yeah. He looks like a samurai...
Leafa
240183_12_a
Is he an enemy NPC?
Kirito
240183_11_a
Who are you?!
???
240183_10_a
Kirito
240183_9_a
Uwaaah! Sure, give me a heart
attack, why doncha!
Leafa
240183_8_a
Hey, who's there?!
???
240183_7_a
Yeah...
Kirito
240183_6_a
Welp, I guess we just keep
going this way for now.
Leafa
240183_5_a
The ceiling's so low, I doubt it'd
make much of a difference.
Kirito
240183_4_a
Yeah. Seems like we can't fly
in here.
Leafa
240183_3_a
Leafa
240183_2_a
bg_event_japan_castle_inside
So this is what the castle
looks like inside...
Kirito
240183_1_a
Yay! Thank you!
Leafa
240181_16_a
Alright, let's give it a shot.
Kirito
240181_15_a
I'm more interested in that part
than exploring a castle, really.
Kirito
240181_14_a
Why? Do you want to do a no-kill
run?
Leafa
240181_13_a
Well, it doesn't specifically say
that we CAN'T...
Leafa
240181_12_a
Ah, okay. Then we aren't
supposed to attack the lord?
Kirito
240181_11_a
so we have to sneak in and steal
it back.
Leafa
240181_10_a
Nope, not defeat him. He stole
some treasure and hid it inside,
Leafa
240181_9_a
What? So we have to sneak in and
defeat an evil lord or something?
Kirito
240181_8_a
Wanna give it a try?
Leafa
240181_7_a
There's a new quest to go along
with the castle too. You have to
sneak inside it.
Leafa
240181_6_a
Ahaha, yeah, you're right.
Leafa
240181_5_a
Yeah? That doesn't fit in with
ALO's theme at all... Though it's
not the first time that happened.
Kirito
240181_4_a
that was created for the second
part of the collab with that
Japanese-themed game.
Leafa
240181_3_a
Kirito
240181_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Hey, Kazuto! Looks like there's a
Japanese castle in ALO
Leafa
240181_1_a
Ha ha, did I? I think you're
imagining things.
Sakuya
240148_41_a
You said something rude about that
player who chose the same
chocolate as me, didn't you?
Leafa
240148_40_a
Wait...
Leafa
240148_39_a
Great idea!
Leafa
240148_38_a
Good, then let's return to town
and make that chocolate!
Sakuya
240148_37_a
Yep, all thanks to you!
Leafa
240148_36_a
So were you able to get the
ingredient you need?
Sakuya
240148_35_a
Okay... Then I'll let you from
now on.
Leafa
240148_34_a
And I want to help you as such.
Sakuya
240148_33_a
But I'm your friend first,
your lord second.
Sakuya
240148_32_a
And thank you. I do appreciate
that you wanted to keep me safe.
Sakuya
240148_31_a
I see...
Thank you, Sakuya.
Leafa
240148_30_a
Once I learned this simple way of
defeating them, I knew I had to
go after you.
Sakuya
240148_29_a
It's almost impossible to defeat
them head-on, but strike them from
the rear and they're finished.
Sakuya
240148_28_a
These mobs appear in gangs. They
aren't that strong, but their
fronts are impervious to attack.
Sakuya
240148_27_a
Sakuya...
Leafa
240148_26_a
It is not in my nature to turn
a blind eye when a friend is
in trouble.
Sakuya
240148_25_a
I may be in a position of power,
but I'm still a member of the
Sylph race.
Sakuya
240148_24_a
How could you do something so
reckless?! You shouldn't put
yourself in danger...
Leafa
240148_23_a
So I decided to gather as much
info as I could and then follow
you.
Sakuya
240148_22_a
I could tell you would never have
let me come after you back there.
Sakuya
240148_21_a
That's not what I meant! I meant
why did you come?! I told you to
wait...
Leafa
240148_20_a
and what you need to do to beat
it. I'm sorry I got here late.
Sakuya
240148_19_a
She was an odd one, but she told
me all about this monster's
behavioral pattern,
Sakuya
240148_18_a
I ran into another player who had
made the same chocolate you
want to, Leafa.
Sakuya
240148_17_a
Sakuya... Why did you...?
Leafa
240148_16_a
Phew... I'm glad I made it in
time...
Sakuya
240148_15_a
Gyaaaaaggghh!
Monster
240148_14_a
Take THIIIS!
Leafa
240148_13_a
R-Right!
Leafa
240148_12_a
Now, Leafa!
Sakuya
240148_11_a
Sakuya?!
Leafa
240148_9_a
Sakuya
240148_10_a
Ngghh?!
Monster
240148_8_a
Hyaaaaah!
???
240148_7_a
Crap, I'm surrounded!
Leafa
240148_6_a
Graaaaahhhh!
Monster
240148_5_a
This isn't gonna end well...
I need to withdraw!
Leafa
240148_4_a
Tch... I didn't think I'd be
facing this many of them...
Leafa
240148_3_a
Leafa
240148_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
Graaaaaaah!
Monster
240148_1_a
...
Sakuya
240147_21_a
But Leafa
Sakuya
240147_20_a
I'll only be a few minutes, so
wait right here, okay?
Leafa
240147_19_a
Looks like it spawns near here, so
I'll just run out, bash its brains
in, and be back in a flash!
Leafa
240147_18_a
Really, I'll be all right on my own.
A mob like this won't cause me
too much grief.
Leafa
240147_17_a
No. I'm not going to sit this one
out, not when we've come this far.
Sakuya
240147_16_a
Nope... But you stay here, Sakuya.
I'll beat it and come back before
you even know I'm gone.
Leafa
240147_15_a
You're kidding...
Sakuya
240147_14_a
Ugh... The last ingredient we need
we can only get from fighting
a monster...
Leafa
240147_13_a
What is it?
Sakuya
240147_12_a
Huh...?
Leafa
240147_11_a
Exactly.
Leafa
240147_10_a
Ha ha, and for chocolate, no less.
I suppose it really is no
laughing matter, though...
Sakuya
240147_9_a
I hate to even think about what
would happen if you got killed
helping me on this quest...
Leafa
240147_8_a
But you have to expect the
unexpected in this game.
Leafa
240147_7_a
I can hold my own against minor
mobs or your average player.
Sakuya
240147_6_a
Just because I'm the Sylph lord
doesn't mean I'm completely
incapable of fighting, you know.
Sakuya
240147_5_a
We might have been in trouble if
we'd have had to get some items
by fighting monsters or anything.
Leafa
240147_4_a
Yeah. It's nice we were able to
get all of this in town.
Leafa
240147_3_a
Leafa
240147_2_a
bg_event_valentine
Alright, I think we have
everything we need now.
Sakuya
240147_1_a
Very well. Then we have some
ingredients to gather.
Sakuya
240145_23_a
Yeah! This is the one!
Leafa
240145_22_a
So, have you decided?
Sakuya
240145_21_a
Hehe, I meant it as a compliment.
Sakuya
240145_20_a
Heeey, are you calling me
a child?!
Leafa
240145_19_a
and all you can focus on is the
thing's cuteness... Sometimes I
forget how young you are.
Sakuya
240145_18_a
Here we were talking about
ingredients and other chocolate
fundamentals,
Sakuya
240145_17_a
Whaaaat? Come on, how is this
not the cutest thing you've ever
seen?!
Leafa
240145_16_a
Hmm... It looks like some demented
ghoul to me...
Sakuya
240145_15_a
Yeah! Awww, it's so cute!
Leafa
240145_14_a
Is that a chocolate...doll?
Sakuya
240145_13_a
Wh-What is that...?
Sakuya
240145_12_a
item_event_chocolate
Good point! Oh, I want to make
this one!
Leafa
240145_11_a
And even in the real world, there
are fruit-flavored chocolates and
liqueur-filled ones, among others.
Sakuya
240145_10_a
In the real world, yes. But there
are probably special combinations
here in VR.
Sakuya
240145_9_a
Cacao, butter, sugar...
Leafa
240145_8_a
Aren't the ingredients basically
the same, though?
Leafa
240145_7_a
It seems no matter which one you
choose, you have to gather the
ingredients yourself.
Sakuya
240145_6_a
So we can choose what kind we want
to make from this lineup.
Sakuya
240145_5_a
Wow, look at all the chocolate
they have!
Leafa
240145_4_a
Sakuya
240145_3_a
Leafa
240145_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
Welcome!
NPC Shopkeeper
240145_1_a
Okay!
Leafa
240143_24_a
Hehe, that is true... Look.
There are the shops. Let's go.
Sakuya
240143_23_a
You're the one who brought it up
in the first place!
Leafa
240143_22_a
Ha ha, think what you like. In any
case, we have more important things
to discuss.
Sakuya
240143_21_a
Still, it feels like you're not
being a hundred percent honest...
Leafa
240143_20_a
Yes.
Sakuya
240143_19_a
You're really close in the real
world too, aren't you?
Leafa
240143_18_a
I suppose the one I'm closest to
is Alicia. She is my best friend,
after all.
Sakuya
240143_17_a
But no, no one as close as the
kind you seem to be hoping for.
Sakuya
240143_16_a
Hmmm... Well, there are those I
know well enough to give
chocolate.
Sakuya
240143_15_a
I mean, you're in college, right?
Leafa
240143_14_a
I-In any case, do you have a
boyfriend or anything in the real
world, Sakuya?
Leafa
240143_13_a
Hmm... If you say so.
Sakuya
240143_12_a
Because w-we're family! Right?
Families give each other chocolate
on Valentine's Day all the time!
Leafa
240143_11_a
Oh, uh... Um... B-Because...
Leafa
240143_10_a
Why is it that you want to give
chocolate to Kirito?
Sakuya
240143_9_a
Huh? What is it?
Leafa
240143_8_a
Hmm...
By the way, Leafa...
Sakuya
240143_7_a
Alright, then let's go!
Leafa
240143_6_a
I believe if we go to the shops in
the center of town, we can choose
what kind of chocolate to make.
Sakuya
240143_5_a
You're supposed to be able to
learn how to make chocolate here,
but where?
Leafa
240143_4_a
Ha ha, indeed. It really appeals
to one's inner child.
Sakuya
240143_3_a
Sakuya
240143_2_a
bg_event_valentine
Whoooaa! It's like they pulled
this town right out of a fairy
tale!
Leafa
240143_1_a
I don't know if that should make
me happy or sad...
Recon
240141_42_a
...
Recon
240141_41_a
Leafa
240141_40_a
Sakuya
240141_39_a
Th-Thank you...
Recon
240141_38_a
Oh, and I'll make some chocolate
for you too! We're friends,
after all!
Leafa
240141_37_a
Yeah! See you later, Recon!
Leafa
240141_36_a
Shall we head out?
Sakuya
240141_35_a
gasp
Recon
240141_34_a
Y-Yeah... Hehehe, I thought I'd
give it to Kirito.
Leafa
240141_33_a
Um, so are you going to make
some chocolate there?
Recon
240141_32_a
Y-Yeah, you're right.
I understand...
Recon
240141_31_a
I just thought it'd be a good
chance for Sakuya to get out,
since she hardly ever does.
Leafa
240141_30_a
Yeah, sorry, Recon... You can only
go as a pair. But I'm sure someone
else would go with you!
Leafa
240141_29_a
Um... I guess I can't come with
you, huh...?
Recon
240141_28_a
Really? Thank you!
Leafa
240141_27_a
Then I shall accompany you. If
it's within our territory, I will
be safe from harm, after all.
Sakuya
240141_26_a
That's the place!
Leafa
240141_25_a
Ah, you can go to the town there
for help making chocolate,
isn't that right?
Sakuya
240141_24_a
Wanna come with me?
Leafa
240141_23_a
Apparently you can only go there
in a party of two, and both of
you have to be the same race.
Leafa
240141_22_a
So, Sakuya, you know that new area
they released for Valentine's Day?
Leafa
240141_21_a
H-Hi...
Recon
240141_20_a
Oh, hi to you too, Recon.
Leafa
240141_19_a
It seems we've been spotted.
Sakuya
240141_18_a
Recon
240141_17_a
Sakuya
240141_16_a
Oh! Hey, Sakuya!
Leafa
240141_15_a
C-Could she be thinking...
about m-me...?
Recon
240141_14_a
That's exactly what I mean.
Sakuya
240141_13_a
Wha
?! You don't mean she's
thinking about Valentine's Day?!
Recon
240141_12_a
Considering the time of year...
Yes, that must be it.
Sakuya
240141_11_a
Oh, you're right...
Recon
240141_10_a
She looks like she's very
deep in thought.
Sakuya
240141_9_a
Huh?
Recon
240141_8_a
Wait a moment, Recon.
Sakuya
240141_7_a
Heeey, Leaf
Recon
240141_6_a
Hmm...
Sakuya
240141_5_a
Sakuya
240141_4_a
Oh, Lady Sakuya, look!
It's Leafa! It's Leafa!
Recon
240141_3_a
What should I doooo?
Leafa
240141_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hmmm... Hmmmmm...
Leafa
240141_1_a
ありがとう、みんな……
ユウキ
240138_32_a
あはは、そう……だね
じゃあありがたくこれは
もらっておくよ
ユウキ
240138_31_a
ふふっ……
アスナ
240138_30_a
はは、すまんすまん
キリト
240138_29_a
キリトさん!?
せっかくカッコつけてるんだから、
余計なこと言わないでくれる!?
クライン
240138_28_a
おお……
クラインがなんだか、
まともなことを言ってる
キリト
240138_27_a
んで、天穂日命みてーに
強くなりたいと願えばいいさ……
クライン
240138_26_a
お前ぇがまだ自信を持てねぇなら、
その度にその刀を見ればいい
クライン
240138_25_a
クライン……
ユウキ
240138_24_a
これはお前ぇの強さの証明
天穂日命の名を刻む刀だからこそ、
お前ぇが持つ意味があるんだぜ
クライン
240138_23_a
いや、ユウキ
これはお前ぇのだ
クライン
240138_22_a
item_event_amenohohi
だからこれはクラインに……
ユウキ
240138_21_a
ま、まあとにかくボクは
それが目的だったから、
この刀をもらうことじゃないんだ
ユウキ
240138_20_a
そ、そうかな……えへへ
ユウキ
240138_19_a
ユウキは……
きっと楽な道は選ばないよ
地上のために戦ってくれるはずだよ
アスナ
240138_18_a
気づいたらエントリーしてたんだよ
あはは……
ユウキ
240138_17_a
用意された楽な道を選んじゃわない
かなって思ったら、なんだか彼に
笑われてる気がして……
ユウキ
240138_16_a
ボクがもし彼だったら、
同じようなことできるかな?
ユウキ
240138_15_a
ユウキ……
アスナ
240138_14_a
楽な道に戻らず
敢えて苦難の道を進んだんだ……
ユウキ
240138_13_a
彼は……アメノホヒは……
神として高天原に戻ることが
できたのに……
ユウキ
240138_12_a
うん……
だって人には生まれ持った
境遇や運命があるでしょ?
ユウキ
240138_11_a
挑戦状……?
アスナ
240138_10_a
そんな気がしてね
ユウキ
240138_9_a
なんかその話を聞いたとき、
ボクはその神様に
挑戦状を突き付けられたような……
ユウキ
240138_8_a
らしいな
まあ諸説あるみたいだけど……
キリト
240138_7_a
そして数年後に帰れることになっても
そのまま地上に残って、
地上のために戦ったらしいんだよ
ユウキ
240138_6_a
地上はすごく荒れていて、
彼はそのことを憂いた……
ユウキ
240138_5_a
その神様って天照大神の子供
なんだけどね、地上に遣わされて、
そこで数年過ごしたらしいんだ
ユウキ
240138_4_a
アスナ
240138_3_a
キリト
240138_2_a
bg_event_alo_arena
アメノホヒの名前を知って、
ボク神話を調べてみたんだ
ユウキ
240138_1_a
えっ……?
アスナ
240137_23_a
うーんと……
欲しいとは……
ちょっと違うかな?
ユウキ
240137_22_a
でもわたし……てっきりユウキは
その刀が欲しくて
大会に出場したのかと思ってたよ
アスナ
240137_21_a
こんなレアな刀なら……
きっとクラインみたいなプレイヤーが
本来は持つべきでしょ?
ユウキ
240137_20_a
うん、だってクラインは
刀使いだもんね
ユウキ
240137_19_a
えっ……ユウキいいの?
アスナ
240137_18_a
へっ……!?
クライン
240137_17_a
良かったらあげようか?
ユウキ
240137_16_a
まあそうだけどよ……
クライン
240137_15_a
でもクラインは
アメノホヒが欲しかったんだよね
ユウキ
240137_14_a
これはオレの実力が
足りねーってだけだぜ……
クライン
240137_13_a
い、いやもう構わねえよ
参加したいって言った順番なんて、
カンケーねぇからな……
クライン
240137_12_a
楽しみにしてた大会なのに、
ボクが後から横取りするような
感じになっちゃって……
ユウキ
240137_11_a
あはは……
クライン、ごめんね
ユウキ
240137_10_a
惜しくなんかねーよ!
ユウキのHPほとんど
減ってなかっただろーがよ!
クライン
240137_9_a
クラインも惜しかったな
キリト
240137_8_a
アスナー!
応援ありがとー!
ユウキ

ユウキ～!
おめでとー!
アスナ
240137_4_a
よーし!
これで優勝はボクのもの!
やった～!
ユウキ

ユウキ

bg_event_alo_arena
ぐぇへ……
ま、負けた……
完膚なきまでに……
クライン
240137_1_a
だ、だよね……
アスナ
240135_26_a
まあユウキが相手じゃ……
無理だろうな……
次元が違いすぎる……
キリト
240135_25_a
クラインはALOの
プレイヤーの中ではかなりの
上位に入るのは確かだけど……
キリト
240135_24_a
クラインさん……
勝てると思う?
アスナ
240135_23_a
………………
アスナ
240135_22_a
ああ、がんばれよ!
キリト
240135_21_a
おしっ、元気出てきたぜ!
今から帰って対策考えてやるぜ!
あんがとな!
クライン
240135_20_a
キリの字……
そ、そうだよな……
諦めるにはまだ早い……!
クライン
240135_19_a
今からでも対策を練れば、
きっと勝つ可能性もゼロじゃない!
キリト
240135_18_a
ユウキにだって弱点やスキ、
勝機は必ずあるはずだ
キリト
240135_17_a
クライン、女々しいぞ
いくら強い相手とはいえ戦う前から
諦めるなんて情けないだろ?
キリト
240135_16_a
今回の優勝はオレのもんかと、
安心してたのによぉ……
クライン
240135_15_a
んなこたぁどうでもいいんだよ!
くそぉ……ユージーンのオッサンも
参加しねぇらしいし、
クライン
240135_14_a
どうなんだろう……?
アスナ
240135_13_a
なにか心境の変化でもあったのか?
キリト
240135_12_a
さっき正式に出場すると決めたって
連絡があったんだ……
アスナ
240135_11_a
ユウキは大会のこと知って
数日は悩んでたみたいなんだけど……
アスナ
240135_10_a
そ、そうだけどさ……
キリト
240135_9_a
だってお前ぇ二度も負けたんだろ!
クライン
240135_8_a
おい、それはちょっと
聞き捨てならないぞ
キリト
240135_7_a
あの絶剣ユウキが参加するんじゃ、
キリト以上に勝ち目ねぇじゃねーか!
クライン
240135_6_a
キリの字が参加しねぇって聞いて、
超ラッキーって思ってたのによぉ!
クライン
240135_5_a
ご、ごめんね……

アメノホヒ……かぁ
ユウキ
240133_22_a
うん、そうだね
アスナ
240133_21_a
なるほど……金色で、
まるで夕暮れに輝く稲穂みたい……
名前とも合っててカッコイイね
ユウキ
240133_20_a
ふぅん
ああ、画像があったよ
アメノホヒは刀なんだね
ユウキ
240133_19_a
アメノホヒって言うらしいよ
日本神話の神様の名前みたい
アスナ
240133_18_a
ここに大会の情報が書いてあるね
なになに……報酬は……ん?
これなんて読むのかな?
ユウキ
240133_17_a
……あっ
ユウキ
240133_16_a
でもボクまだ参加するって
決めたわけじゃないし
ユウキ
240133_15_a
なるほど、ふふっ
そうだったんだね
ユウキ
240133_14_a
今ユウキに教えちゃったら、
ものすごい強敵が立ちはだかる
ことになるよ……あはは
アスナ
240133_13_a
クラインさんがね、キリトくんが
参加しないって聞いたら、
ライバル減るって喜んでたの
アスナ
240133_12_a
えっ、どうしたの?
ユウキ
240133_11_a
あっ……しまった
アスナ
240133_10_a
それ、ボクも参加してみようかな～
ユウキ
240133_9_a
へぇ～、そんなのあるんだね
ボクはなにか新しい大会でもないか
見に来ただけだったんだけど……
ユウキ
240133_8_a
友達のクラインさんが
参加するって言ってたから
アスナ
240133_7_a
わたしは今度行われるっていう
剣士限定の大会について
ちょっと情報集めに来たんだ
アスナ
240133_6_a
ふふっ、確かに
アスナ
240133_5_a
あはは、それを言うなら
アスナも一緒だよね?
ユウキ
240133_4_a
うん、そうだね
今日って大会はないはずだけど、
こんな場所でどうしたの?
アスナ
240133_3_a
アスナ!
わあ、奇遇だね!
ユウキ

すげぇ斬れる刀らしくてな

えっ?
ええと、そいつは……
クライン

クラインさん、
キリトくんを誘いに来たの?

ああ、新春の記念に開催されるとか

確か剣士限定の大会だったな
キリト

Well, I've got an early start
tomorrow. Time to log out
and get some sleep.
Kirito
240128_20_a
Or was it my imagination?
Kirito
240128_19_a
But...I could've sworn I heard
a song...
Kirito
240128_18_a
O-Oh, yeah... I must have fallen
asleep before I logged out...
Kirito
240128_17_a
Huh...?
Kirito

humming Christmas tune
???
240128_15_a

Kirito

And encourage them to reach
higher... What do you think,
Sachi?
Kirito
240128_13_a
I hope I've become someone who can
shine a light on people's lives...
Kirito

I...hope I've proved you right...

Goodnight, Yui.

Goodnight, Daddy.

I guess I will.
Sleep mode, activate!
Yui

Okay, Daddy. 
yawn
Yui
240128_5_a
Yui, don't worry about me.
Head to bed if you want.
Kirito
240128_4_a
Oh, just another minute or two.
I'll go back soon.
Kirito
240128_3_a
Daddy? Why haven't you logged out
yet? Mommy's already gone.

move on...
Kirito

Asuna... Thank you. Honestly,
I can't remember much from when
I locked myself away anymore...
Kirito
240127_22_a
Umm... Sorry. I kinda got preachy
there.
Asuna
240127_21_a
...
Kirito
240127_20_a
You'd keep fighting so that one
day you could be that sort of
person to others in need.
Asuna
240127_19_a
Yeah. You decided that even if you
couldn't be the person she thought
you were now...
Asuna
240127_18_a
Umm... You mean the Santa thing?
Kirito
240127_17_a
It was what she said to you that
broke you out of your shell,
wasn't it?
Asuna
240127_16_a
After what you just told me,
I think I finally understand why
you were able to move on.
Asuna
240127_15_a
Asuna...
Kirito
240127_14_a
You seemed lost, and there was an
incredible sadness in your eyes.
But you fought harder than ever.
Asuna
240127_13_a
I remember that, you know? When
you came back to the Assault
Team...
Asuna
240127_12_a
I... Yeah, I guess I did.
Kirito
240127_11_a
You cried, you suffered, and you
moved on. You continued to live
your life.
Asuna
240127_10_a
Yeah...?
Kirito
240127_9_a
But Kirito...
Asuna
240127_8_a
Ha ha... After that I locked myself
in my room in town for days...
Kirito
240127_7_a
Kirito...
Asuna
240127_6_a
How worthless I am... How I have
no right to protect anyone...
Kirito
240127_5_a
Every time I remember what she
said...all I can think of is how I
failed to protect her...
Kirito
240127_4_a
That I was a warm and caring
person who encouraged her to try
harder...
Kirito
240127_3_a
She said that...that I was like
Santa from that song about the
red-nosed reindeer...
Kirito
240127_2_a
bg_03_forest_snow
The Moonlit Black Cats... One of
them...left me a message.
Kirito
240127_1_a
But there's still a part of me
that wants to find them again,
to talk with them...
Kirito
240125_21_a
I thought I had moved on.
I thought I could forget them...
Kirito
240125_20_a
I don't know...
Kirito
240125_19_a
Kirito...
Do you still want to see them?
Asuna
240125_18_a
So that's what was bothering you.
Asuna
240125_17_a
Maybe I can see them again...
Or at least, I get that feeling.
Kirito
240125_16_a
Maybe the people I couldn't save
are here somewhere too...
Kirito
240125_15_a
And if...if SAO's Hollow Data
is here...
Kirito
240125_14_a
So I'm having trouble accepting
it... It can't just be pure
coincidence...
Kirito
240125_13_a
But ALO shares the same core
system as SAO.
Kirito
240125_12_a
That Hollow Anima monster... maybe
it was coincidence its name was so
similar to the Hollow Area.
Kirito
240125_11_a
...
Asuna
240125_10_a
I guess...ten seconds is how long
it took for the NerveGear to fry
your brain after your avatar died.
Kirito
240125_9_a
I found the revival item...and
learned it only worked on someone
dead for less than ten seconds.
Kirito
240125_8_a
I never heard about that...
So...what happened?
Asuna
240125_7_a
There was a rumor that this boss
dropped an item that could revive
a player.
Kirito
240125_6_a
Was that even possible?
Asuna
240125_5_a
I wanted to see if defeating it
would really let me bring a dead
player back to life...
Kirito
240125_4_a
The Christmas after it happened,
I went in search of a special
monster.
Kirito
240125_3_a
I do.
Asuna
240125_2_a
bg_03_forest_snow
A long time ago, I joined a guild
in SAO and lost people very
special to me. Remember?
Kirito
240125_1_a
Ha ha, nice one...
Asuna... I told you about
this briefly once before...
Kirito
240123_18_a
Hehe, reading my boyfriend's heart
is my very own unique skill!
Unlocked at love level a million!
Asuna
240123_17_a
Ha ha, I give up. You can see
right through me, Asuna.
What tipped you off?
Kirito
240123_16_a
I...
Kirito
240123_15_a
I think it's the Christmas season
that's got you upset. So, am I
right?
Asuna
240123_14_a
No, I'm not talking about that
anymore. I don't think it's the
Hollow Area that's bothering you.
Asuna
240123_13_a
What are you talking about? The
Hollow Area didn't traumatize me
that much...
Kirito
240123_12_a
Wait a second!
Me...?!
Kirito
240123_11_a
I see... So I guess the only one
still imprisoned by their past is
you.
Asuna
240123_10_a
Philia's grown stronger.
She won't let a painful past
dictate her future anymore.
Kirito
240123_9_a
Actually...no, she wasn't.
I was worried about her at first
too, but she seemed fine.
Kirito
240123_8_a
It's about Philia... She was pretty
shaken when she heard the
word "Hollow," wasn't she?
Asuna
240123_7_a
Hey Asuna... What's up? Why the
sudden urge for an evening stroll?
Kirito
240123_6_a
...
Asuna
240123_5_a
And it's winter now... ALO's
seasons are based somewhat
on the real world.
Kirito
240123_4_a
Yeah, it would be. Coniferous
trees like these only grow in
cold climates.
Kirito
240123_3_a
Brrr!
It's kinda cold out here, huh?
Asuna
240123_2_a
bg_03_forest_snow
...
Kirito
240123_1_a
Huh...?
Kirito
240121_24_a
Hey Kirito? Can we stay on a bit
longer? I want to go for a walk
together.
Asuna
240121_23_a
...
Asuna
240121_22_a
Right... Good...
Kirito
240121_21_a
I...see...
Asuna
240121_20_a
N-No, Philia thought so for a
second too, but it seems like it's
just the name that's similar.
Kirito
240121_19_a
Hollow... Like the Hollow Area
back in SAO? Are they related?
Asuna
240121_18_a
Daddy and Philia fought a big
monster called a Hollow Anima
and got materials. That's all.
Yui
240121_17_a
Mommy.
Yui
240121_16_a
Did something happen in the woods?
Asuna
240121_15_a
I have? N-No, that's...
Kirito
240121_14_a
Ever since you got back, you've
been acting kinda weird...
Asuna
240121_13_a
Huh? What is it?
Kirito
240121_12_a
Kirito...?
Asuna
240121_11_a
I had fun too...
Kirito
240121_10_a
Yeah, let's. But just so you know,
I had a lot of fun at the Christmas
party with you today.
Asuna
240121_9_a
Ha ha, sorry. Anyway, it's getting
late. Want to log out?
Kirito
240121_8_a
Oh, cut it out, Kirito!
Stop rubbing it in!
Asuna
240121_7_a
Ha ha, I see you're still a
scaredy-cat when it comes
to the paranormal.
Kirito
240121_6_a
W-Well... Good...
That's a relief...
Asuna
240121_5_a
That's correct. So you don't have
to be scared, Mommy.
Yui
240121_4_a
Y-Yeah, there was...but I took
care of it. It's gone now.
Kirito
240121_3_a
Th-There's a ghost in the woods?!
Asuna
240121_2_a
bg_13_home_lounge_sunset
Wh-Wh-What?!
Asuna
240121_1_a
アイアイサ～!
ストレア
240118_14_a
みんな、最後のひと踏ん張りよー!
240118_13_a
そうね
残りはお皿を並べておかなくちゃ
240118_12_a
あっ、皆さんそろそろキリトさん達が
集合する時間ですよ
シリカ
240118_11_a
そ、そんなことないよ……
みんなもアタシのワガママに
付き合ってくれてありがとね～
ストレア
240118_10_a
そうね～
今回ばかりはストレアに感謝だわ
240118_9_a
やっぱり乳製品系のレア素材を
たくさん入れられたのが、
大きかったと思うよ
フィリア
240118_8_a
ふふっ、そうだね
でもこれもやっぱりストレアの
思いつきのおかげだよね
フィリア
240118_7_a
あたし達だけでも
ちゃんと美味しそうなケーキ、
できましたね!
シリカ
240118_6_a
はい!
アスナさんが不在で作るのも
ちょっと不安でしたけど……
シリカ
240118_5_a
ふーっ、
一時はどうなることかと思ったけど、
なんとか完成できたわね～
240118_4_a
シリカ
240118_3_a
240118_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
やったね～
これでケーキも完成だよー
ストレア
240118_1_a
ふふっ、
サンタ衣装ゲットしちゃうよ～!
ストレア
240117_18_a
了解です!
シリカ
240117_17_a
じゃあ転移門に戻って
4層にレッツゴーよ!
240117_16_a
うん、キリト達からそう聞いたよー
ストレア
240117_15_a
サンタ衣装を手に入れるには……
確か4層に行くんだよね?
フィリア
240117_14_a
はい、そうですね!
シリカ
240117_13_a
サンタ衣装を手に入れたら、
ようやく戻ってケーキ作りを
再開できるわね
240117_12_a
とにかくこれにてケーキ素材も
全部収集完了ね
あとはストレア先生ご所望の
240117_11_a
えへへ、バレたか～
ストレア
240117_10_a
あはは……
でもこれってただの偶然でしょ?
フィリア
240117_9_a
ふっふっふ～
どうどう、アタシの実力は～?
ストレア
240117_8_a
ほんと今回に関しては、
ストレアの思いつきサマサマよね～
240117_7_a
ふふっ、偶然とはいえ、
レア物たくさんゲットできて嬉しいな
フィリア
240117_6_a
これで必要な素材は
全部手に入ったねー
フィリア
240117_5_a
やったわね、シリカ!
240117_4_a
フィリア
240117_3_a
240117_2_a
bg_05_danac
やりましたよ!
これでレアなバター素材、
《レックル・バター》ゲットです!
シリカ
240117_1_a
確かにそうなりそうね!
240115_29_a
ふふっ、
結果的に新生アインクラッドに
来て良かったですねー!
シリカ
240115_28_a
はい、そうですね!
シリカ
240115_27_a
ケーキ素材に
合いそうなのもあるはずだし、
今からそれ狙ってみよーよ!
フィリア
240115_26_a
あたし2層のレア食材、
いくつか手に入れる方法知ってるよ!
フィリア
240115_25_a
おおっ……!
それいいじゃない!
ストレア、でかした!
240115_24_a
そのと～り～!
ストレア
240115_23_a
通常はなかなか入手しにくい、
乳製品素材も沢山ある場所だよ!
フィリア
240115_22_a
ああ、なるほど!
アインクラッドの2層って言えば、
牛ワールドだね!
フィリア
240115_21_a
えと……それって……
240115_20_a
2層……ですか?
シリカ
240115_19_a
それでさ、今から2層に行くのは
どうかなって思ったんだー
ストレア
240115_18_a
ケーキの素材で
乳製品集めなきゃダメでしょ?
ストレア
240115_17_a
ええっ!?
またストレアの思いつき?
もーっ、今度はなんなのよ……
240115_16_a
それよりもちょっと
思いついたことがあるのー
ストレア
240115_15_a
やり方はキリト達から聞いたから、
多分すぐにできると思うんだー
ストレア
240115_14_a
えっ、どうして?
240115_13_a
ねえねえ、それ後回しにしないー?
ストレア
240115_12_a
じゃあ次はサンタ衣装ね……
240115_11_a
えへへ、
みんな手伝ってくれてありがとね!
ストレア
240115_10_a
そうですね
なんだか懐かしい感じです
シリカ
240115_9_a
わーっ!
ホントにSAOのときのやつね
240115_8_a
……ほい!
どう?
ストレア
240115_7_a
うん、いいよー
ストレア
240115_6_a
おめでとう、ストレア!
早速なってみてよ
フィリア
240115_5_a
これでSAOアバターになれるよ～!
ストレア
240115_4_a
240115_3_a
フィリア
240115_2_a
bg_10_field
やったー!
これで討伐数達成～!
ストレア
240115_1_a
アイアイサ～ッ!
ストレア
240113_23_a
よーし、さっさと狩るわよ!
後でやること盛りだくさんなんだし!
240113_22_a
そうですね
1層の地上付近なら
そんなに強くないはずですし
シリカ
240113_21_a
なんだ……結構楽ちんなんだね
フィリア
240113_20_a
この近くの草原フィールドにいる
モンスターを何体か討伐すれば
いいんだってー
ストレア
240113_19_a
そのクエストって
なにをすればいいんですか?
シリカ
240113_18_a
うん!
ストレア
240113_17_a
次にサンタ衣装手に入れて、
そしたら最後に乳製品素材を
買いに行くからね
240113_16_a
ハァ……わかったわよ
じゃあちゃっちゃと
クエストクリアしちゃいましょ
240113_15_a
フィリア
240113_14_a
シリカ
240113_13_a
あはは～、ごめんね～
ストレア
240113_12_a
す、ストレアさん、
胸で顔がつぶれて……
息が……できましぇん!!
シリカ
240113_11_a
わ～っ、シリカありがとー!
わかってくれて嬉しいよ～!
ストレア
240113_9_a
シリカ
240113_10_a
叶えてあげたいって思うんです……
シリカ
240113_8_a
それにストレアさんは、SAOで
生まれたAIですから、SAO
アバターになりたいっていう想いは
シリカ
240113_7_a
ま、まあ時間ならまだありますし、
きっと大丈夫ですよ
シリカ
240113_6_a
あーあ、あたし達、ケーキ作り
ほっぽり出して、こんなトコ
来ちゃったけど……いいのかなあ
フィリア
240113_5_a
そうみたいね……
240113_4_a
フィリア
240113_3_a
240113_2_a
bg_11_starting_city
SAOアバター解放のクエが
この新生アインクラッドに
あるんだねー!
ストレア
240113_1_a
そんなワガママな……
240111_27_a
SAOアバターと
サンタコス手に入れないと、
買い物行く気にならないよ～!
ストレア
240111_26_a
ええっ!?
フィリア
240111_25_a
ううん～
まだ～!
ストレア
240111_24_a
ちなみにストレア
乳製品一式はもう買ってきたの?
フィリア
240111_23_a
今はクリスマスパーティ用に
ケーキを用意しないとダメですし……
シリカ
240111_22_a
そ、そんなこと今言われてもねぇ……
240111_21_a
ついでにサンタコスも
着てみたいよ～!
ストレア
240111_20_a
あーん!
アタシもSAO装備に
戻ってみたい～!
ストレア
240111_19_a
メジャー装備かと思いきや、
レアリティが上がってて
手に入れるのすごく大変だって
フィリア
240111_18_a
ああ、それも話題になってたね……
フィリア
240111_17_a
ついでに最近レア装備だって
評判のサンタ衣装を
見つけたらしいんだよー!
ストレア
240111_16_a
そうみたいですね
同じ基幹プログラムで動いてるから
可能ってことみたいですけど
シリカ
240111_15_a
ああ、最近ALOでも
他のVRMMOのアバターに変更
できる機能がついたらしいわね
240111_14_a
キリトとアスナが
SAOアバター装備を
ゲットしたんだってー!
ストレア
240111_13_a
そんなことよりも、大変なんだよ～!
あのね～!
ストレア
240111_12_a
買い物でなにかあったの?
フィリア
240111_11_a
ストレア……どうしたの?
240111_10_a
タッ、タイヘン、タイヘン～～!!
ストレア
240111_9_a
うーん、楽しみだなぁ
ブッシュ・ド・ノエル!
フィリア
240111_8_a
そうね
240111_7_a
ストレアさんの購入分は、
確かバターと牛乳、
生クリームですよね
シリカ
240111_6_a
あとはストレアが買ってきてくれる
乳製品系が揃えばクリスマスケーキを
作れるわね
240111_5_a
小麦粉と板チョコ……
その他調味料系はあるから……
240111_4_a
卵買ってきましたー!
シリカ
240111_3_a
240111_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
果物獲ってきたよー!
フィリア
240111_1_a
うん!
ユウキ
240108_39_a
さあ、帰ろうぜ
みんな待ってるはずだ
キリト
240108_38_a
ふふっ、でもありがとう
迎えに来てくれて
ユウキ
240108_37_a
はは、見破られたか～
キリト
240108_36_a
それにしてもキリト……
言い方がちょっぴりボクに
嫉妬してるみたいだったよ?
ユウキ
240108_35_a
あはは、そうだね……
ちゃんと言っておくよ
ユウキ
240108_34_a
それこそ心眼じゃないけど、
盲目的になるからなぁ……
キリト
240108_33_a
アスナもわかってるとは思うけど、
ユウキに関しては
キリト
240108_32_a
ボクはアスナの横を歩いて……
共に手を取り合っていきたいんだ……
ユウキ
240108_31_a
ああ、ユウキはアスナと……
いつでも対等に立っていたいんだろ?
キリト
240108_30_a
えっ……ああ
それも聞かれちゃってたのかあ
ユウキ
240108_29_a
あと……
特別扱いされたくないって言葉、
アスナにも伝えておけばいいと思う
キリト
240108_28_a
ふふっ、ありがとう
ユウキ
240108_27_a
心眼使いの達人って感じで、
カッコ良かったぜ
キリト
240108_26_a
うん……
イチかバチかの戦法だったけど、
うまくいって良かったよ
ユウキ
240108_25_a
呪術を無効化して敵を一撃で
倒すんだからな
キリト
240108_24_a
敵の挙動と距離感を記憶しておいて、
あえて目を瞑り視界を殺し……
キリト
240108_23_a
そこは心配なかったみたいだな
むしろさすがは絶剣って感じだった
キリト
240108_22_a
でもさっきのバトル
光の呪術にやられてたときは、
一瞬加勢しようかと思ったけど……
キリト
240108_21_a
あはは……
キリトはいつでも
気づき過ぎなんだよ……
ユウキ
240108_20_a
まあそれはどちらでもいいさ
無事に手に入ったみたいだし、
俺は忘れることにするよ
キリト
240108_19_a
……!
ユウキ
240108_18_a
やっぱりパーティには
来ないつもりだったんだろ?
キリト
240108_17_a
でも……ここでもしペンダントを
取れなかったら、
キリト
240108_16_a
あはは
ユウキ
240108_15_a
ユウキのことに関しては、
少々過保護な気はするけどな、はは
キリト
240108_14_a
まあユウキは一度やらかしてるだろ?
アスナも気が気じゃないんだよ
キリト
240108_13_a
あはは、ボクも信用ないなぁ
ユウキ
240108_12_a
はぁ、なるほど……
お目付役ってわけだね
ユウキ
240108_11_a
……!
ユウキ
240108_10_a
知らなかったか?
俺けっこう追跡スキルの熟練度も
高いんだぜ
キリト
240108_9_a
で、でも居場所を
設定オフにしたままだったのに……!
ユウキ
240108_8_a
こうして迎えに来たってわけだよ
キリト
240108_7_a
アスナが、
ユウキがちゃんとパーティに来るか、
心配だって言うからさ
キリト
240108_6_a
キリト!?
ど、どうしてここに!?
ユウキ
240108_5_a
よっ、ユウキ
お疲れさん
キリト
240108_4_a
えっ?
ユウキ
240108_3_a
ユウキ

bg_event_dungeon_alo
まさか目を閉じて突撃するなんて、
思わなかったな……

うおおおーーっ!!!
ユウキ
240107_14_a
目なんて見えなくたって……
ボクにはこれまで培ってきた経験と
この剣の腕がある……!
ユウキ
240107_13_a
これでお前の視力は
一切が絶たれる!!
呪術使い
240107_12_a
ならば再び喰らうがいい
我が光の呪術!
呪術使い
240107_11_a
まだ向かってくるか……
諦めの悪い妖精だ
呪術使い
240107_10_a
一人だけ特別扱いなんて……
なんかイヤだ!
ユウキ
240107_9_a
ボク、やっぱりちゃんと用意したい
アスナ達にはいつもお世話に
なってるし、
ユウキ
240107_8_a
そういうわけにはいかないよ……!
アスナは交換用のプレゼントは
要らないって言ってくれたけど……
ユウキ
240107_7_a
大人しくペンダントは諦め、
ここから立ち去ることだ
呪術使い
240107_6_a
この敵Mobとインプは
相性が悪かったのか……!
ユウキ
240107_5_a
くうっ……そうか
あのナビキャラさんが言ってたのは、
そういう意味だったのか……
ユウキ
240107_4_a
暗視を得意とするインプのお前には
堪えるだろう
呪術使い
240107_3_a
これは私が神と崇める
太陽神の光の呪術……
呪術使い
240107_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
くっ……
目が……見えない!?
ユウキ
240107_1_a
来るがいい!
呪術使い
240105_22_a
わかったよ
ボク、そこそこ強いけど覚悟してね!
ユウキ
240105_21_a
……!
そうなのかあ……
戦いは避けられないってことだね
ユウキ
240105_20_a
目的の物は私が持っている
手に入れたくば私と戦い奪うことだ
呪術使い
240105_19_a
哀れな……
えと、そのペンダントが欲しいのは
正解なんだけど……
ユウキ
240105_18_a
《煌星のペンダント》を
手に入れるためにやってきた
哀れな妖精か
???
240105_17_a
いかにもこの浮島の主だが……
そうか貴様も
???
240105_16_a
わっ……
そのローブ姿……
もしかしてあなたが呪術使い?
ユウキ
240105_15_a
貴様、なにものだ……?
???
240105_14_a
さて、どこにあるのかな……?
ユウキ
240105_13_a
ここにある《煌星のペンダント》は、
すごく綺麗でクリスマスの贈り物に
ピッタリだって聞いたけど……
ユウキ
240105_12_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
ここか……
ユウキ
240105_11_a
うん!
じゃあ行ってくるね～!
ユウキ
240105_10_a
)s5
……止めても無駄のようじゃな
ならば精々気をつけることだ
NPC
240105_9_a
その人と戦うことじゃないからね
ユウキ
240105_8_a
それに今回の目的はその浮島にある
《煌星のペンダント》を
探すことなんだ
ユウキ
240105_7_a
平気平気、こう見えてもボクは
けっこう名の知れた剣士なんだよ
ユウキ
240105_6_a
)s5
お主インプじゃろう?
とても太刀打ちできないはずだ……
NPC
240105_5_a
)s5
独りは止めておいた方がいい
あの浮島に住む呪術使いは、
特殊な技を使う
NPC
240105_4_a
うん、ちょっと今仲間がいなくて……
ユウキ
240105_3_a
ユウキ
240105_2_a

お前さん、独りで行くつもりかい?
NPC

………………
アスナ
240103_32_a
はーい
ユウキ
240103_31_a
今日の午後5時から開始だから
絶対に来ること、いいわね?
アスナ
240103_30_a
ならいいけど……
うん、待ってるからね
アスナ
240103_29_a
あはは、さすがにボクはそこまで
強情っぱりじゃないよ
ユウキ
240103_28_a
えっ、いや……ちゃんと来るなら
いいんだけど、ユウキ……
抵抗するかと思ったから……
アスナ
240103_27_a
ど、どうしたのアスナ?
ユウキ
240103_26_a
えっ……?
アスナ
240103_25_a
そ、そう……えへへ
わかったよ、
じゃあお邪魔させてもらおうっかな
ユウキ
240103_24_a
そんなの気にしないわよ!
手ぶらで全然構わないんだよ?
アスナ
240103_23_a
ボ、ボク
なにも準備してなかったし……
ユウキ
240103_22_a
それに向けてみんな頑張って
用意してるって聞いてたから……
ユウキ
240103_21_a
だって確かアスナ達のパーティって
みんなでプレゼントの交換会を
やるんでしょ?
ユウキ
240103_20_a
もう、
どうして言ってくれなかったの?
水臭いじゃない
アスナ
240103_19_a
あはは……シウネー、鋭いや
ユウキ
240103_18_a
……!
ユウキ
240103_17_a
もしかしたらそうせずに、
独りで過ごそうとしてるのかも
しれないって!
アスナ
240103_16_a
シウネーに連絡をもらったの!
ユウキはアスナさん達のパーティに
参加させてもらうって言ってたけど、
アスナ
240103_15_a
と、というか
アスナはどうしてボクを
探してたの……?
ユウキ
240103_14_a
どうしてそんなことしたの!?
アスナ
240103_13_a
う、うん……
ユウキ
240103_12_a
も、もう探したよ!
ユウキ、居場所を検索される設定オフ
にしてたでしょ!?
アスナ
240103_11_a
えっ、アスナ……?
ユウキ
240103_10_a
ユウキ
240103_9_a
ユ、ユウキ!!
アスナ
240103_8_a
…………………
ユウキ
240103_7_a
スリーピング・ナイツのみんな、
現実で楽しく過ごしてると
いいけど……
ユウキ
240103_6_a
クリスマスかぁ……
ユウキ
240103_5_a
あはは、今日はボクだけか……
いつもは人気の狩り場
なんだけどなぁ……
ユウキ
240103_4_a
よし、これで20匹は倒したかな
ユウキ
240103_3_a
グギャァッ!
モンスター
240103_2_a
bg_event_field
てりゃあっ!!
ユウキ
240103_1_a
はぁ……
さて、どうしよっかなぁ……
ユウキ
240101_14_a
………………
ユウキ
240101_13_a
うん、楽しんできてね
ユウキ
240101_12_a
そう……わかったわ
じゃあ私は行きますね
シウネー
240101_11_a
ALOのアスナのお家に集まって
パーティするらしいんだ
ユウキ
240101_10_a
大丈夫だって
ほら、代わりにアスナ達のクリスマス
パーティに参加させてもらうからさ
ユウキ
240101_9_a
ユウキ……
シウネー
240101_8_a
あんまり羽目を外さないようにって
言っておかなきゃ、あはは
ユウキ
240101_7_a
だからシウネーも満喫してきてね
あ、あとテッチやタルケンに
メッセ送って
ユウキ
240101_6_a
それでいいんだよ
現実で過ごせる日をクリスマスに
するのは、当然だと思うし
ユウキ
240101_5_a
でもこれじゃあクリスマスに
ALOにダイブできるのがユウキ
だけになっちゃうわ……
シウネー
240101_4_a
ううん、気にしないで
シウネー
ユウキ
240101_3_a
ユウキ
240101_2_a
bg_21_alne
ごめんなさい、ユウキ……
シウネー
240101_1_a
うん!
ユウキ
240098_31_a
じゃあ今からログハウスに行こうか
アスナ
240098_30_a
わかりました
平たく言うと何でもいいって
ことでしょ?
アスナ
240098_29_a
はは、じゃあシェフのお任せってやつで
頼むぜ
キリト
240098_28_a
それじゃあ漠然とし過ぎてて
わかんないよ～
アスナ
240098_27_a
じゃあねー、何かレアな食材使った、
高級そうなやつ!
ユウキ
240098_26_a
ふふっ、りょうかいー
何作ろっか?
アスナ
240098_25_a
おおっ、それはいいな
俺もそれで頼むぜ
キリト
240098_24_a
じゃあ久しぶりにアスナの手料理が
食べたいな!
ユウキ
240098_23_a
わたしにできることなら
何でもするから、
遠慮なく言ってよ
アスナ
240098_22_a
ふふふっ、二人に借りができたし、
こっちも何かお礼しなきゃね
アスナ
240098_21_a
あはは、うん……
そうだけど改めて言われると
照れちゃうな
ユウキ
240098_20_a
ユウキの真摯な気持ちが伝わって……
その……嬉しかったんだ
キリト
240098_19_a
そんな中で独り諦めずに対策を
ユウキが探し続けてくれたのは、
アスナのためだもんな……
キリト
240098_18_a
みんな自発的な回復を諦めてるだろ?
キリト
240098_17_a
だって今回の《風の邪気》って症状……
やられてるプレイヤーもそこそこ
いるみたいだが、
キリト
240098_16_a
えっ?
ユウキ
240098_15_a
いや……ただの偶然さ
むしろ俺の方が……嬉しかったよ
キリト
240098_14_a
でもキリトが来てくれないと
失敗してた所だったよ
あのとき助けに来てくれてありがとう
ユウキ
240098_13_a
そうだったんだね
アスナ
240098_12_a
それが最近実装された新デバフ状態の
回復薬の素材になってたんだ
ユウキ
240098_11_a
新素材《世界樹の花弁》……
要するに花びらだね
ユウキ
240098_10_a
うん、これもユウキとキリトくんの
おかげだよ……ありがとう
アスナ
240098_9_a
良かったな、アスナ
キリト
240098_8_a
わあ!
やったね!
ユウキ
240098_7_a
風の邪気のアイコンも消えて、
正常に戻ったよ!
アスナ
240098_6_a
ああっ……!
ステータス画面が更新されたよ!
アスナ
240098_5_a
ど、どう……アスナ?
ユウキ
240098_4_a
キリト
240098_3_a
ユウキ
240098_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
………………
アスナ
240098_1_a
ははは、わかったよ
キリト
240097_20_a
でも無作為に取り過ぎないよう
注意しようね!
リソース保護も大事だよ!
ユウキ
240097_19_a
あはは、わかったよ!
ユウキ
240097_18_a
よし、しらみつぶしだ
この花園一帯で採集できる素材、
根こそぎ取る勢いでやってやるぞ!
キリト
240097_17_a
ううん、まだ行ってないよ
ユウキ
240097_16_a
ユウキ、あっちの方角は何か
調べてみたか?
キリト
240097_15_a
この先……
ユウキ
240097_14_a
ってことは俺達がこの先に進むのを
邪魔したのかもしれない……!
キリト
240097_13_a
でも倒し切っても
何もドロップしなかったけど……
ユウキ
240097_12_a
たとえば新素材の入手にやってくる
プレイヤー達の邪魔をしに出てきた
とか……十分考えられるぞ
キリト
240097_11_a
実は対処法もシークレットで
実装されてて……
今のMob達は、
キリト
240097_10_a
かもな……
シルフの新しい魔法の実装に伴い、
キリト
240097_9_a
アスナのデバフ状態と何か
関係あるのかな?
ユウキ
240097_8_a
いや……
そうでもなかったと思うんだが……
キリト
240097_7_a
そうだね
でもここって普段から
こんなにモンスターが出る場所なの?
ユウキ
240097_6_a
これで片付いたみたいだな……
キリト
240097_5_a
よし!
ユウキ
240097_4_a
ギャアッ!!
モンスター
240097_3_a
キリト
240097_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
セリャアアッ!!
ユウキ
240097_1_a
ああ、もちろん!
キリト
240095_18_a
キリト……手助け頼めるかな?
ユウキ
240095_17_a
とりあえずこいつらを片付けるのが
先みたいだな
キリト
240095_16_a
ギャウギャウッ!
モンスター
240095_15_a
あはは……なるほどね
ユウキ
240095_14_a
俺も同じってことさ
キリト
240095_13_a
ユウキも、アスナを回復させる手段を
探して、この世界樹の苗木で復活した
花園までやってきたんだろ?
キリト
240095_12_a
キリト!?
どうしてここに!?
ユウキ
240095_11_a
考えてることは一緒だな、ユウキ
キリト
240095_10_a
えっ!?
ユウキ
240095_9_a
ギャアアオオッ!!
モンスター
240095_8_a
ユウキ
240095_7_a
シッ!!
キリト
240095_6_a
わわっ、これはちょっと……
マズイかも!
ユウキ
240095_5_a
グギャア!!
モンスター
240095_4_a
モンスター!?
しかも……数が多い……!
ユウキ
240095_3_a
グラアアッ!
モンスター
240095_2_a
bg_04_field_flower
きっとここに……
何かヒントがあるはず……!
ユウキ
240095_1_a
うん、大丈夫!
任せといて!
ユウキ
240093_22_a
あはは、ありがとうユウキ
でもあんまり無理はしないでね
明日奈
240093_21_a
心配しないで!
必ず見つけてみせるから!
ついでにキリトよりも早くね!
ユウキ
240093_20_a
で、でも……
明日奈
240093_19_a
ボクもアスナを治す手段
探してみるよ!
ユウキ
240093_18_a
ユウキ?
明日奈
240093_17_a
そっかぁ……よーし
ユウキ
240093_16_a
ゲームなんだから必ず対処法は
あるはずって、キリトくんはずっと
言ってるんだけどね
明日奈
240093_15_a
うーん、キリトくん達と調べて
みたんだけど、今のところ
そういう手段はなさそうなんだ……
明日奈
240093_14_a
そうだよね……
ねえ、それって回復アイテムとか魔法で
無効化させることはできないのかな?
ユウキ
240093_13_a
このデバフ効果って具体的に
何日まで続くとか決まってないんだよ
先が見えないと、なんだか不安で……
明日奈
240093_12_a
そうだね……数日だけとはいえ、
この状態が続くのはね……
明日奈
240093_11_a
でも落ち込んでるって聞いたから……
ユウキ
240093_10_a
もちろん元気だよ
風邪って言っても別に現実で
体調崩した訳じゃないからね、あはは
明日奈
240093_9_a
ありがとう
アスナ、元気?
ユウキ
240093_8_a
はい、したよ
明日奈
240093_7_a
もちろんだよ!
今プローブの視聴覚機能を
オンにするから待ってて!
明日奈
240093_6_a
うん、今大丈夫かな?
ユウキ
240093_5_a
えっ?
この声……ユウキ?
明日奈
240093_4_a
アスナ
???
240093_3_a
明日奈
240093_2_a
bg_event_asuna_room_real
……アスナ
???
240093_1_a
うん、もちろんだよ!
ユウキ
240091_22_a
きっと喜ぶと思うんだ
キリト
240091_21_a
ああ、少し落ち込んでたから、
ユウキも暇なときにプローブで
話しかけてやってくれないか?
キリト
240091_20_a
ダイブしないかもしれないって
言ってたね……
リーファ
240091_19_a
アスナさん
風邪の効果が消えるまでの数日は、
リーファ
240091_18_a
まあどの種族も一枚岩じゃないしな
キリト
240091_17_a
誰がやったのか、
今サクヤ達が調査中ではあるけど、
もしかしたらレネゲイドかもしれないね
リーファ
240091_16_a
そ、そうなんだ……
ユウキ
240091_15_a
別のシルフのプレイヤーに襲われて、
やられちゃったんだって
リーファ
240091_14_a
アスナさんがソロで
素材集めしてたときに、
リーファ
240091_13_a
ま、まさか!
あたしはそんなことしないよ
リーファ
240091_12_a
リーファがアスナにその呪いを
かけたの?
ユウキ
240091_11_a
その他ステータスが半減以下に
なっちゃうの
リーファ
240091_10_a
数日で解けるんだけど、
その間はずっとHPやMP、
リーファ
240091_9_a
うん、最近実装された新魔法で
風妖精専用の奴があってね
リーファ
240091_8_a
風って付くからには、
風妖精シルフと関係があるの?
ユウキ
240091_7_a
まあその名前が《風の邪気》……
略して風邪だ
キリト
240091_6_a
ゲームとかでよく《呪い》とか
あるだろ?
それに近いデバフ喰らっちゃったんだよ
キリト
240091_5_a
あっ……いや、
正確にはうーんと、なんて言うんだろ
キリト
240091_4_a
リーファ
240091_3_a
キリト
240091_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
えっ?
アスナがALOで《風邪》引いた!?
ユウキ
240091_1_a
うん……でもやっぱり言わせて
リズ、ありがと
レイン
240068_21_a
レインは人見知りの殻を破って、
自分の力でその剣を手に入れたのよ
240068_20_a
あたしはなにもしてないわ
むしろあそこでちゃんと声をかけて
交渉できたからでしょ?
240068_19_a
まさに得することがあったよ
これもリズのおかげだよ
レイン
240068_18_a
う、うん
今日はリズに付いてきて良かったよ
レイン
240068_17_a
なんだかすごそうね
ふふっ、でも良かったわね
240068_16_a
多分そうだと思う
レイン
240068_15_a
その島に訪問することでレシピを
見つけられるから、
島を作る武器が作れるってわけね
240068_14_a
元々《天沼矛》は島を作るほどの
強大な力を持っていたって言われてる
神様の武器だったんだって
レイン
240068_13_a
日本神話に伝えられる
神器から名付けられた剣……
《天沼矛剣（あめのぬぼこのけん）》
レイン
240068_12_a
へぇ……そんな風に
ゲットできるレシピもあるのね
ねえ、なんて言う武器なの?
240068_11_a
あそこに着いた時、わたしの
鍛冶スキルのステータスに
新レシピが表示されたんだよ
レイン
240068_10_a
前にキリト君たちに
連れてってもらったの
レイン
240068_9_a
うん、もう消えちゃったんだけど、
南方にできた特殊なエリアでね
レイン
240068_8_a
あの島……?
240068_7_a
フラグ解放の条件は
あの島に辿り着いた
レプラコーン……だと思う
レイン
240068_6_a
うん、このレシピはね
ある場所に行くことで見つかったの
レイン
240068_5_a
えっ……そうなの?
あの会場にいる全員がわからないって
言ってたわよ?
240068_4_a
あ、あれはね……
実はあれを使って作れる武器の
レシピを……わたし知ってたんだ
レイン
240068_3_a
レイン
240068_2_a
bg_18_mountain_sunset
あの素材、どうするの?
240068_1_a
レイン……
240067_29_a
あ、ありがとうございます!
レイン
240067_28_a
ああ、いいぜ
どうせ持ってたって意味ないしな
持っていってくれ
レプラコーン
240067_27_a
わ、わたし大した素材持ってないので
等価交換にはならないかも
しれませんけど……
レイン
240067_26_a
もし良ければそれ譲って
もらっていいですか……?
レイン
240067_25_a
えっ……?
240067_24_a
あっ……えと
レイン
240067_23_a
さすがにあたしも要らないかな……
240067_22_a
うーん、どの武器レシピとも
合致しないわね……
240067_21_a
ぶっちゃけどんな装備が作れるのか
全然わからないし……要るか?
レプラコーン
240067_20_a
この素材と、この素材が
余ってるんだ……
レプラコーン
240067_19_a
う、うん……
レイン
240067_18_a
ああ、そうだったわね
じゃあ今回はあたしが交渉するのを
隣で見ててよ
240067_17_a
で、でもわたしそんなに
余り素材持ってないよ……
レイン
240067_16_a
確かに面白そう……!
あたし達も参加しましょうよ
240067_15_a
ああ、いいぜ!
面白いと思う!
効率的だしな!
240067_14_a
これだけのメンツが揃ってるんだ
お互いに欲しかったり余ってる素材が
結構あると思うんだよ
レプラコーン
240067_13_a
ついでと言ってはなんだが、
もし良ければこの後で
不要素材の交換会をやらないか?
レプラコーン
240067_12_a
ん……どうしたのかしら?
240067_11_a
ああ、忘れてた
最後にちょっといいか、みんな
レプラコーン
240067_10_a
ふふっ、そう
なら良かったわ
240067_9_a
う、うんと……
まあまあだったかな?
レイン
240067_8_a
い、意見を求められたときは、
かなりテンパっちゃったけど……
レイン
240067_7_a
レイン、どうだった?
240067_6_a
……ほっ
レイン
240067_5_a
お疲れ様でした
240067_4_a
240067_3_a
レイン

さて、これで
今日の定例会は終了だ
レプラコーン
240067_1_a
そ、そうかなぁ……?
レイン
240065_16_a
脳筋プレイヤーのレインでも
得することがきっとあるはずだから!
240065_15_a
まあ……そうだったわね
だ、大丈夫よ
240065_14_a
うーん……
でもほら、わたしってあんまり
鍛冶屋として活動してないし……
レイン
240065_13_a
それが簡単に手に入るんだから
役立てないでどうするのよ
240065_12_a
レプラコーンのトッププレイヤーが
あれだけ揃っていれば、最新の情報が
ほぼ集まってるようなものよ
240065_11_a
レプラコーンは鍛冶妖精
つまり素材に関する情報や
武器レシピを知ることが大事でしょ?
240065_10_a
役立つこと……?
レイン
240065_9_a
それにちゃんと役立つことや、
得することだってあるはずだから
240065_8_a
あの人たちはレプラコーンの上位陣よ
誘われただけ、
ありがたいと思いましょうよ
240065_7_a
すごく居心地悪かったんだもん……
レイン
240065_6_a
で、でもぉ……
前にあの集まりに出席したとき、
なんか堅苦しい雰囲気で
レイン
240065_5_a
ALOにおいて種族の活動は
ギルドと同じくらい重要なのは
わかってるでしょ?
240065_4_a
まったくいつまでも
泣き言言わないの
240065_3_a
240065_2_a
bg_event_alo_sky
ふぇぇ……
レイン
240065_1_a
はは……まあがんばれ
キリト
240063_24_a
ふぇぇ～～ん!
キリトく～ん、アスナちゃ～ん!
レイン
240063_23_a
冗談でわざわざ迎えに来ないでしょ
いいから、さっさとする!
240063_22_a
え、ええっ!?
ホントに!?
レイン
240063_21_a
逆だねぇじゃないわよ!
あたしも呼ばれてるんだから、
ほら行くわよ
240063_20_a
よく聞くけど……
わたしの場合……うん
確かに逆だねぇ
レイン
240063_19_a
ネット上で社交性あって
はっちゃけてる人が、現実で根暗で
引きこもりだったりってのは、
レイン
240063_18_a
あ、あはは……確かにそうだね
レイン
240063_17_a
なんで仮想世界だと、
時々そうなるんだろうな……?
キリト
240063_16_a
レインって現実だと
アイドル目指してるし、
メイド喫茶でバイトもしてるのに、
キリト
240063_15_a
また出た
レインの人見知り
240063_14_a
ええと……わたし種族の活動に
これまであんまり
参加してこなかったから、その……
レイン
240063_13_a
レイン、
ホントはどうするつもりだったの?
アスナ
240063_12_a
ま、まあまあリズも落ち着いて
アスナ
240063_11_a
あんた今キリト達と
談笑してたでしょ?
240063_10_a
あ、ああ……そう言えば
こ、今回はパスしようかなって……
忙しいし……
レイン
240063_9_a
招待のメッセ来てたでしょ?
240063_8_a
そうよ! レインあなた、
今日のレプラコーンの集まりに
参加しないつもりなの?
240063_7_a
えっ、わたし!?
レイン
240063_6_a
レインを探してたのよ!
240063_5_a
リズ?
どうしたんだ?
キリト
240063_4_a
キリト
240063_3_a
レイン
240063_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
ああっ!
いた!
240063_1_a
アスナさーん、
そりゃないっす……
キリト
240061_18_a
あはははっ!
なんだ～、まさに真実そのままだね
ちゃんと伝わってたんだね
アスナ
240061_17_a
ななっ……!
キリト
240061_16_a
最終的には人の和の真ん中に
いつも陣取ってるって話も聞いたよ
レイン
240061_15_a
でも離れようとするくせに
結局すぐに戻ってきて、
レイン
240061_14_a
うへぇ……
そんな情報が広まってたのかよ
キリト
240061_13_a
なにかにつけて、
集団行動を嫌がるって
レイン
240061_12_a
攻略組の黒の剣士は、凄腕なのに
他のプレイヤーと共に
行動するのが苦手で、
レイン
240061_11_a
ああ、SAOの頃の話だよね
よく噂には聞いてたよ
レイン
240061_10_a
うぐっ……
キリト
240061_9_a
そうだよ、可哀想だよ
それに万年ソロだったキリトくんには
そんな事言われたくないよねぇ
アスナ
240061_8_a
も、もーっ!
キリト君、昔の話でしょ?
恥ずかしいから止めてよ～
レイン
240061_7_a
最初の頃は後を追っかけてくるくせに
すぐ逃げようとして、おまけに
いつも謝ってばかりだったよな
キリト
240061_6_a
はは、それにしてもレイン……
だいぶ俺たちに
打ち解けてくれたよな
キリト
240061_5_a
ふふっ、そうだね
今思い返しても
笑っちゃうよね～
アスナ
240061_4_a
キリト
240061_3_a
アスナ
240061_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
あはは
でもあのクエストは
ほんと楽しかったよね～
レイン
240061_1_a
Hehe, thanks.
Asuna
240058_25_a
Okay, I'll be sure to keep you
in the loop!
Yuuki
240058_24_a
Don't forget me! I'd like to come
along next time too!
Asuna
240058_23_a
You know I will!
Yuuki
240058_22_a
Yeah, ditto for me. Hit me up
again if you catch wind of any
other interesting info.
Kirito
240058_21_a
Hahaha, well, I had fun at least.
It was nice getting to hang out
with you, Kirito.
Yuuki
240058_20_a
Kirito... The devs aren't going
to ignore someone who keeps trying
to find ways to break the system.
Asuna
240058_19_a
Yeah. For a gamer, there's nothing
better than figuring out how
to game the game, you know?
Kirito
240058_18_a
That's what's bothering you? Not
that you couldn't get the cloak?
Asuna
240058_17_a
Seriously?
Asuna
240058_16_a
No, I meant that the Spriggan
figured out a workaround
before I did...
Kirito
240058_15_a
Do you want to be able to fly in
the dark that much, Kirito?
Asuna
240058_14_a
I just...can't believe it...
Kirito
240058_13_a
What a shame...
Asuna
240058_12_a
Apparently nothing they tried
after that worked. The Spriggan
could never hold on to the cloak.
Yuuki
240058_11_a
The cloak was only in the
Spriggan's storage for a moment
before it went back to the Imp's.
Yuuki
240058_10_a
Its automatic processers sent out
a patch for that loophole
in a matter of seconds.
Kirito
240058_9_a
Yeah. The Cardinal System doesn't
miss a beat.
Kirito
240058_8_a
You mean...
Asuna
240058_7_a
We didn't even need to ask them.
We could tell the second we saw
the dejected look on their faces.
Kirito
240058_6_a
What happened?
Asuna
240058_5_a
W-Well...
Yuuki
240058_4_a
Kirito
240058_3_a
Yuuki
240058_2_a
bg_18_inn_restaurant_morning
So...
What did that Spriggan say?
Asuna
240058_1_a
Sure!
Kirito
240057_20_a
Hehehe, it feels like we've played
this game all the way into
overtime! Let's get going!
Yuuki
240057_19_a
Seems like this quest for the
Imp cloak is far from over.
Kirito
240057_18_a
Take me there.
Kirito
240057_17_a
Want to go have a little chat
with this player? I know where
they are right now...
Yuuki
240057_16_a
I see... I have to hand it to
them. That's an ingenious way
of using loopholes in the system.
Kirito
240057_15_a
And then when the Spriggan
beat the monster, it
dropped the cloak!
Yuuki
240057_14_a
That sounds like one of those
snatcher mobs...
Kirito
240057_13_a
that can steal items and things
from players, so it picked it up...
Yuuki
240057_12_a
First the Imp dropped the cloak
and left it in some dungeon.
I guess there's a monster there
Yuuki
240057_11_a
Apparently they tried an experiment
with one of their friends
that was an Imp.
Yuuki
240057_10_a
How in the world is that even
possible?
Kirito
240057_9_a
They're saying it was a Spriggan
that used some kind of underhanded
tactics to get it!
Yuuki
240057_8_a
You've got to be joking!
Kirito
240057_7_a
Someone got their hands on one!
Someone who's not an Imp!
Yuuki
240057_6_a
What about it? I'm not an Imp,
so it's not like I can own one...
Kirito
240057_5_a
Imp cloak...?
Oh, the one that made it so
you could fly in the dark?
Kirito
240057_4_a
This is bad! This is real bad!
Remember that Imp cloak?
Yuuki
240057_3_a
Huh? Yuuki?
What's wrong?
Kirito
240057_2_a
bg_21_alne
K-Kirito!
Yuuki
240057_1_a
Oh, well, good.
Kirito
240055_22_a
Don't say that! It was fun!
Yuuki
240055_21_a
Yep. Sorry to take up so much
of your time.
Kirito
240055_20_a
So I suppose that's case closed,
then.
Yuuki
240055_19_a
Yeah.
Kirito
240055_18_a
Well, I guess that's a relief
for us Imps. We don't have to
worry about losing our advantage.
Yuuki
240055_17_a
I bet it's just some worthless
item someone created because
they thought it sounded cool.
Kirito
240055_16_a
It's probably impossible to make
any sort of equipment that can
imitate the Imps' ability.
Kirito
240055_15_a
You think?
Yuuki
240055_14_a
What the hell...? Hmm...
This is all a big setup.
Kirito
240055_13_a
It goes without saying that
you can't sell it or auction it
off either.
Yuuki
240055_12_a
And you can't even transfer it
to someone who's NOT an Imp.
Yuuki
240055_11_a
I know. There's no way to tell if
the one wearing it is an Imp
who can already fly in the dark.
Yuuki
240055_10_a
And what's even the point
if it DOES work?
Kirito
240055_9_a
Huh? But wait, how can you tell
if the cloak even works like that?
Kirito
240055_8_a
They were already an Imp!
Yuuki
240055_7_a
But...?
Kirito
240055_6_a
Yeah, there was one player, but...
Yuuki
240055_5_a
You did?
Does anyone actually have it?
Kirito
240055_4_a
So I found out a bit more
about that cloak!
Yuuki
240055_3_a
Hey, Yuuki!
Kirito
240055_2_a
bg_21_alne
Kiritoooo!
Yuuki
240055_1_a
That'd be a big help. Thanks.
Kirito
240053_26_a
Then I'll look into that too.
Yuuki
240053_25_a
Yeah. It could be one of those
legendary "conditional" items that
don't actually exist in the system.
Kirito
240053_24_a
There must be...
That'd be pretty important
to find out, huh?
Yuuki
240053_23_a
Hey... Are there any players who
have already gotten the cloak?
Kirito
240053_22_a
Hehe, you're thinking of getting
up to no good, aren't you...
Yuuki
240053_21_a
Well, I just... I guess I could
always make a dummy account as an
Imp and get the info that way...
Kirito
240053_20_a
Huh?! I've never known you to give
up on anything in these games!
You're a total completionist!
Yuuki
240053_19_a
I know so!
I think I better give this up...
Kirito
240053_18_a
Haha, you think so?
Yuuki
240053_17_a
Oh. Wait, what?!
What do you mean, "just"?!
That's SERIOUSLY not good!
Kirito
240053_16_a
I'd just lose my ability to fly
in the dark.
Yuuki
240053_15_a
No, nothing like that would
happen.
Yuuki
240053_14_a
But only say what you can say! I'm
not going to do anything to make
you go all renegade or whatever!
Kirito
240053_13_a
So it's basically taboo outside of
your own race... What would happen
if you did tell someone?
Kirito
240053_12_a
That's why we absolutely cannot
tell other races how or where to
get the cloak...
Yuuki
240053_11_a
Yeah, you're right... All the
races are kind of at war with
each other here in ALO...
Kirito
240053_10_a
It'd be super bad news for them if
just whipping on a cloak gave the
other races that ability too.
Yuuki
240053_9_a
Think of it this way: being able
to fly in the dark is like the
Imps' secret weapon.
Yuuki
240053_8_a
What are you talking about?
Kirito
240053_7_a
I don't think you should even try.
Yuuki
240053_6_a
Well, from the sound of things...
it's gonna be a pain in the butt.
But more than that...
Yuuki
240053_5_a
Awesome! So can we get it?
Kirito
240053_4_a
Good! I've been looking into that
cloak I told you about. I found an
Imp NPC with tons of info on it!
Yuuki
240053_3_a
Hey, Yuuki. How's it going?
Kirito
240053_2_a
bg_21_alne
Kiritoooo!
Yuuki
240053_1_a
Hahaha, your wish is my command.
Yuuki
240051_30_a
No way... Alright, clear your
schedule, my dear Miss Zekken. I
want to know all about this cloak.
Kirito
240051_29_a
They say there's this rare item
that allows players who aren't
Imps to fly in the dark. A cloak.
Yuuki
240051_28_a
There-what?
Kirito
240051_27_a
Oh, there is.
Yuuki
240051_26_a
It'd be nice for those of us who
aren't Imps if there was an item
we could equip to deal with that.
Kirito
240051_25_a
You know, considering flight is
ALO's main draw, it's weird how
often you can't use it.
Kirito
240051_24_a
You got it.
Yuuki
240051_23_a
So if something like that happens
again, don't hold back.
Kirito
240051_22_a
That kind of situation becomes way
more manageable with even just one
person who's able to fly.
Kirito
240051_21_a
I get that, I guess, but...
Kirito
240051_20_a
Hehe, that's totally it. I mean,
the whole point of that quest was
that you couldn't fly.
Yuuki
240051_19_a
You wanted to experience the same
frustration of being stuck as
everyone else...just for fun?
Kirito
240051_18_a
sigh
... I'm not sure what being
solid has to do with anything,
but let me get this straight.
Kirito
240051_17_a
Ehehehe...
Yuuki
240051_16_a
Um... Because it was, uh...
Out of...solidarity?
Yuuki
240051_15_a
I knew it.
Why'd you keep it quiet?
Kirito
240051_14_a
Well, I'd have to give it another
go to be certain, but...I was
able to fly then. I think.
Yuuki
240051_13_a
Um... Yeeaah...
Yuuki
240051_12_a
Imps can fly in the dark and all,
right? I meant to ask back then,
but I totally spaced...
Kirito
240051_11_a
Wh-What?!
Yuuki
240051_10_a
All of us except you.
Kirito
240051_9_a
Both things kept the sunlight from
reaching our wings, so they got
too weak for all of us to fly.
Kirito
240051_8_a
The fog in the valley,
the sandstorm in the desert...
Kirito
240051_7_a
Well, there's been something
bugging me ever since...
Kirito
240051_6_a
Yeah, I remember joining you
guys on our little adventure.
Yuuki
240051_5_a
You remember that event with the
Jewel in Butterfly Valley?
Kirito
240051_4_a
Hmm? What's up, Kirito?
Yuuki
240051_3_a
Yuuki
240051_2_a
bg_21_alne
Hey, Yuuki.
Kirito
240051_1_a
Yeah. Spasiba.
Rain
240048_29_a
Then why don't you come with us?
We can all get stronger together,
so your master won't scold you.
Asuna
240048_28_a
Hehe, I bet she would.
Asuna
240048_27_a
Ehehe, here I go crying again...
My master would scold me if
she saw...
Rain
240048_26_a
Rain...
Kirito
240048_25_a
Liz... I... Thank you...
Thank you... 
sniff
Rain
240048_24_a
You carry that strength she gave
you even now here in ALO.
Liz
240048_23_a
You know, Rain... Your master
lives on in your avatar.
Liz
240048_22_a
Hahaha, it wasn't that big of
a deal...
Rain
240048_21_a
Because you wanted to help
Seven, right?
Asuna
240048_20_a
This time, I wanted to be strong.
Rain
240048_19_a
I thought I couldn't keep going
like that, so I got a job and
started singing...
Rain
240048_18_a
Then I started slowly remembering
about my master...
Rain
240048_17_a
Yeah. After rehab, my life
was like it had been before,
like I'd never even played.
Rain
240048_16_a
O-Of course I am...
Um, then...you went back
to your real life afterwards?
Liz
240048_15_a
I'm glad you told us.
You're glad too, right, Liz?
Kirito
240048_14_a
Heh, it's kind of embarrassing
to talk about.
Rain
240048_13_a
So...that's how I spent my time
in SAO.
Rain
240048_12_a
That's when I heard the
announcement that SAO
had been beaten.
Rain
240048_11_a
I don't really remember
how long I spent just crying
in my master's home.
Rain
240048_10_a
I went into mourning...
Rain
240048_9_a
I knew in my head that it was just
the programmed scenario, but...
I was still overcome with grief.
Rain
240048_8_a
Yeah... I was heartbroken, even
though I knew she was just an NPC.
Rain
240048_7_a
So that scenario got triggered...
Kirito
240048_6_a
It seems that scenario was due to
play out once her disciples
reached a certain level.
Rain
240048_5_a
It's more accurate to say she'd
always been sick.
Rain
240048_4_a
She got sick?
Liz
240048_3_a
Liz
240048_2_a
bg_21_alne
The illness that killed my master.
Rain
240048_1_a
What kind of event?
Kirito
240047_49_a
Then an incident...or rather an
event happened.
Rain
240047_48_a
But I figured I was at least able
to help the Assault Team...
Rain
240047_47_a
I was still scared, still didn't
believe in myself.
Rain
240047_46_a
Right. And that's how I was going
to get strong...or so I thought.
Rain
240047_45_a
gain EXP that way, you wouldn't
have been able to level very
efficiently, right?
Asuna
240047_44_a
If you didn't join up with
the Assault Team to fight
the tough floor bosses and
Asuna
240047_43_a
So that's what happened...
Liz
240047_42_a
Well, we all went down to the
lower floors and joined parties
with other players.
Rain
240047_41_a
Then me and the others-oh, uh,
by "others," I mean her other NPC
disciples...
Rain
240047_40_a
Once I'd trained enough under my
master, she kicked us out.
Rain
240047_39_a
It was. I gained lots of EXP and
materials from going out to
hunt mobs.
Rain
240047_38_a
So it was just that bonus
that helped you get stronger?
Kirito
240047_37_a
That's how I got so
much more EXP, even though
I was fighting weak monsters.
Rain
240047_36_a
and I got a bonus from
studying under her.
Rain
240047_35_a
Well, my master's home was
an instance map,
Rain
240047_34_a
But would just training like that
get your level and your skills
as high as they are?
Kirito
240047_33_a
I spent the better part of two
years learning to fight and to
forge in those mountains.
Rain
240047_32_a
My master was about my mother's
age. She eschewed others and
lived a life of isolation.
Rain
240047_31_a
That's where I met her and
where I became her student.
Rain
240047_30_a
I roamed all over, trying to
escape that death game. That's
how I came to the mountains.
Rain
240047_29_a
tempering both metal
and her own body.
Rain
240047_28_a
My master lived a hermit's life
in the mountains,
Rain
240047_27_a
Yeah...
Asuna
240047_26_a
I guess there were other NPCs in
Aincrad besides Yui who had AI.
Kirito
240047_25_a
AI, huh? I see...
Kirito
240047_24_a
Yeah. But not just any NPC.
One with AI, one capable of
complex thought.
Rain
240047_23_a
An NPC?
Kirito
240047_22_a
I have a master. A master who
taught me how to smith, how to
fight... A master who's an NPC.
Rain
240047_21_a
Rain...
Liz
240047_20_a
So that's why I want to tell you
what happened in SAO.
Rain
240047_19_a
Actually, I was happy you asked.
I could tell you were really
interested in what I had to say.
Rain
240047_18_a
I'm sorry.
Liz
240047_17_a
So that's why I wanted to get to
know you better...b-by asking
those things...
Liz
240047_16_a
I was so happy when we got to be
friends, Rain, so...
Liz
240047_15_a
You know, I...
I've never made friends with
other Leprechauns before...
Liz
240047_14_a
I think that's enough apologizing
for one day.
Asuna
240047_13_a
Ah... Yeah...
Rain
240047_12_a
Come on, you two.
You're getting stuck in a loop.
Kirito
240047_11_a
No, really! I was wrong!
Liz
240047_10_a
Th-That's not true!
Rain
240047_9_a
Y-You didn't do anything wrong!
It was my fault for being so nosy!
Liz
240047_8_a
I-I'm sorry, about before!
I should have answered
your question...
Rain
240047_7_a
Um, Rain... About before...
Liz
240047_6_a
Rain...
Asuna
240047_5_a
Hi, Rain...
Kirito
240047_4_a
Asuna
240047_3_a
Kirito
240047_2_a
bg_21_alne
Hi, Kirito... Hi, Liz...
Rain
240047_1_a
Okay, I understand.
Liz
240045_20_a
Let's give her time.
Kirito
240045_19_a
Even if we keep some distance
from her, things won't go south
like they did before
Kirito
240045_18_a
You're right. Despite all that
she's been through, she's finally
befriended us.
Kirito
240045_17_a
That's why I think we should
wait for her to come to us.
Asuna
240045_16_a
All we can do to help her is be
ready to listen when she needs
to talk.
Asuna
240045_15_a
Even if you were only asking
out of curiosity, Rain has a lot
of painful memories.
Asuna
240045_14_a
Calm down for a second, Liz.
Asuna
240045_13_a
Th-Then maybe I better go
apologize...
Liz
240045_12_a
Maybe your questions touched on
one of Rain's.
Kirito
240045_11_a
Well, SAO survivors do carry
considerable emotional scars...
Kirito
240045_10_a
Kirito, do you think I asked
something I shouldn't have?
Liz
240045_9_a
Luckily Seven had the sense to let
it drop, and then they left...
Kirito
240045_8_a
Yeah.
Kirito
240045_7_a
So then Rain just went quiet?
Asuna
240045_6_a
Well, you see...
Liz
240045_5_a
Kirito, Liz... You've been kind
of quiet. Is something wrong?
Asuna
240045_4_a
...
Kirito
240045_3_a
Liz
240045_2_a
bg_17_restaurant_night
Asuna
240045_1_a
Hm...?
Wh-What's going on?
Did something happen?
Seven
240043_21_a
...
Rain
240043_20_a
Hi, Seven.
Kirito
240043_19_a
Oh, Kirito! Liz!
I didn't expect to see you here!
Seven
240043_18_a
Raaaaaain! Sorry I'm late!
Seven
240043_17_a
Um... Well...
Rain
240043_16_a
Ah, my bad! I'm prying again...
Liz
240043_15_a
all the enhancements you made to
your sword skills. What must your
daily routine have looked like?
Liz
240043_14_a
You honed your smithing skills,
you leveled, and let's not forget
Liz
240043_13_a
That's right...
Rain
240043_12_a
So that must mean you've been
honing your smithing skills
ever since SAO.
Kirito
240043_11_a
You're a Leprechaun. Your smithing
skills aren't as high as Liz's,
but they're still up there, right?
Kirito
240043_10_a
but I didn't really make any
friends in the game until you...
Rain
240043_9_a
We're all friends now,
Rain
240043_8_a
I was pretty much
a loner in Aincrad.
Rain
240043_7_a
N-No, it's fine...
Rain
240043_6_a
Y-You don't have to answer
if you don't want to!
Liz
240043_5_a
S-Sorry, am I prying too much?
Liz
240043_4_a
Ah-!
Liz
240043_3_a
Kirito
240043_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
Rain
240043_1_a
...
Kirito
240041_21_a
I...
Rain
240041_20_a
So what exactly did you do
during the two years you
were in Aincrad?
Liz
240041_19_a
No, I didn't...
Kirito
240041_18_a
Cat's out of the bag...
You didn't know she wasn't part
of the team, did you, Kirito?
Liz
240041_17_a
But you weren't part of
the Assault Team, were you?
Liz
240041_16_a
Y-Yeah...
I mean, I wasn't the strongest
by any means...
Rain
240041_15_a
So to get as strong as you are,
you must have had to do a ton
of leveling in SAO, right?
Liz
240041_14_a
Y-Yeah, along with Kirito
and everyone else.
Rain
240041_13_a
You're an SAO survivor,
right, Rain?
Liz
240041_12_a
Oh, hey,
can I ask you something,
about surviving SAO?
Liz
240041_11_a
Wow, that sounds rough.
Kirito
240041_10_a
I'm actually pretty hard on her.
I'm training her like an SAO
survivor, to toughen her up.
Rain
240041_9_a
Hehe, seems that way.
Liz
240041_8_a
Ha ha, her honor guard may be gone,
but she probably feels safe as long
as you're around, Rain.
Kirito
240041_7_a
So I said I'd go with her
so I could hone my skills too.
She should be here soon.
Rain
240041_6_a
I'm questing with Seven right now.
She runs into way too much trouble
going it alone, you know.
Rain
240041_5_a
What're you up to, Rain?
Liz
240041_4_a
Liz
240041_3_a
Oh, hey, Rain!
Kirito
240041_2_a
bg_20_butterfly_valley
Kirito! Liz!
Rain
240041_1_a
You've got me all wrong!
Kirito
240038_28_a
I can't trust you, Kirito!
Leafa
240038_27_a
Eeewww, Daddy!
Strea
240038_26_a
Daddy, you can't hide your
facial expressions in a VRMMO...
Yui
240038_25_a
N-No, I'm not!
Kirito
240038_24_a
Kirito, you're breaking out
in a cold sweat.
Leafa
240038_23_a
Ha ha, too bad, you could've
proven my innocence... Ha, ha...
Kirito
240038_22_a
Y-Yeah...
You and Yui don't have any special
powers or anything now, huh?
Kirito
240038_21_a
Then I could just access Cardinal
and look up a certain player's
emotional state, easy peasy.
Strea
240038_20_a
I wish I was still a Mental Health
Counseling Program like in SAO.
Strea
240038_19_a
Aaah, too bad!
Strea
240038_18_a
Sure, it was...
Leafa
240038_17_a
Huh? M-Must have just been
your imagination!
Kirito
240038_16_a
I thought I felt someone gazing
longingly at me just now!
Strea
240038_15_a
Hm? Kirito?
Leafa
240038_14_a
Hm? What do you mean?
Yui
240038_13_a
And when the two of them
are in action, it's like...
Wow...
Kirito
240038_12_a
Yeah. It's like they didn't even
need me there at all.
Kirito
240038_11_a
That's great!
Yui
240038_10_a
It started back when the three of
us went questing. They fight
really well together.
Kirito
240038_9_a
Y-Yeah.
Kirito
240038_8_a
Those two have gotten real close
real fast!
Yui
240038_7_a
Leafa
240038_6_a
Yeah, it sure was!
Strea
240038_5_a
Well, if you say so! Hehehe.
In any case, we timed that switch
perfectly! It was awesome!
Leafa
240038_4_a
Hehe, it was nothing next to how
fast you struck, Leafa!
Strea
240038_3_a
Strea
240038_2_a
bg_21_alne
That attack was killer, Strea!
Leafa
240038_1_a
U-Uh, okay.
Leafa
240037_22_a
Yeah, I could probably get pretty
strong. So let's be friends,
okay, Leafa?
Strea
240037_21_a
Skills... Oh, that's right. The
system here isn't based on levels!
Strea
240037_20_a
That makes sense.
So you'll be able to hone your
skills too, right?
Leafa
240037_19_a
To Cardinal's automatic
recognition, we're two totally
different entities.
Strea
240037_18_a
That's why we weren't affected the
same when we were converted.
Strea
240037_17_a
On the other hand, it seems that
Yui was an NPC with no parameters
in SAO.
Strea
240037_16_a
I see.
Leafa
240037_15_a
as an NPC capable of joining in
battle.
Strea
240037_14_a
Well, my best guess is that during
SAO, my parameters were set
Strea
240037_13_a
I was just wondering,
why are you a Gnome and
not a pixie like Yui?
Leafa
240037_12_a
I-It's nothing...
Leafa
240037_11_a
So, what's wrong?
Strea
240037_10_a
S-Sure.
Leafa
240037_9_a
Well, what do you want
me to call you then?
Is just "Leafa" all right?
Strea
240037_8_a
I-I'm way too young to be an aunt!
Leafa
240037_7_a
So I just thought,
as Kirito's daughter,
I should call you "auntie."
Strea
240037_6_a
Well, you're Kirito's sister
in real life, right?
Strea
240037_5_a
Auntie?!
Leafa
240037_4_a
Hm? Yes, Auntie?
Strea
240037_3_a
Strea
240037_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hey, Strea.
Leafa
240037_1_a
That girl is wrapping him
around her little finger...
Leafa
240035_28_a
Ehehe, was it that obvious?
Strea
240035_27_a
I knew it, Strea!
Those were crocodile tears!
Kirito
240035_26_a
Then come sweep up your baby girl
in your big strong arms!
Strea
240035_25_a
Y-You've got it all wrong!
Kirito
240035_24_a
I knew it... You just see me as
some stupid NPC, don't you?
Waaaahhh!
Strea
240035_23_a
Nuh-uh, no way!
I'm totally consenting,
so it's fiiine!
Strea
240035_22_a
Uuhhh... I feel like this
probably violates the
harassment code...
Kirito
240035_21_a
Daaaaddy, come oooon!
Strea
240035_20_a
No, I'm really not...
Leafa
240035_19_a
S-Suguha?
Y-You're glaring at me...
Kirito
240035_18_a
Tch...
Leafa
240035_17_a
I'm waaaaiting!
Strea
240035_16_a
Huh?!
Kirito
240035_15_a
Well then, give me a big bear hug,
Daaaddy!
Strea
240035_14_a
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean it
that way!
Kirito
240035_13_a
Does our relationship
mean that little to you?!
Strea
240035_12_a
Grrr! Kirito, you big meanie!
Don't make it sound so forced!
Strea
240035_11_a
That's just kind of
how it turned out.
Kirito
240035_10_a
Well, ah...
This is Yui's little sister, so...
Kirito
240035_9_a
Now there's this girl...
Leafa
240035_8_a
Just when I thought I'd finally
come to terms with the fact that
Yui is your daughter...
Leafa
240035_7_a
Um...
Leafa
240035_6_a
Leafa? What's the matter?
Kirito
240035_5_a
Ah, yeah...
Leafa
240035_4_a
So, nice to meet you, Leafa!
Strea
240035_3_a
Strea
240035_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Hmm...
Leafa
240035_1_a
Hehehe!
Strea
240033_22_a
Hey, watch out, Strea,
you'll squish Yui!
Kirito
240033_21_a
And one more for me!
Strea
240033_20_a
Strea
240033_19_a
That's not fair!
Daddy, I want a hug too!
Yui
240033_18_a
Uaaah-!
Okay, okay, enough squeezing!
Kirito
240033_17_a
Yui
240033_16_a
Thank you!
Oh, it's been so long,
I just want to squeeze you!
Strea
240033_15_a
...
Yui
240033_14_a
Yeah, I do.
Kirito
240033_13_a
Hehe, but this is great!
Don't you think I'm cute, Kirito?
Strea
240033_12_a
I see.
So she's different from you, Yui.
Kirito
240033_11_a
I think it turned out that way
because Strea was converted
as a fairy NPC.
Yui
240033_10_a
Search complete!
That's a female Gnome avatar.
Yui
240033_9_a
What is this? It's cute,
but I've never seen it before!
Strea
240033_8_a
That looks a little...uh...
Kirito
240033_7_a
Strea...
Yui
240033_6_a
That's right.
Kirito
240033_5_a
from an MHCP
to your private pixie?
Strea
240033_4_a
Yui
240033_3_a
Kirito
240033_2_a
bg_18_mountain
So in this world, this ALO,
my big sister Yui was converted
Strea
240033_1_a
Hahaha, there's a lot to explain.
Kirito
240031_26_a
Hehehe, well, you see...
Yui
240031_25_a
Oh...
Um, who's this little girl?
Why is she so tiny?
Strea
240031_24_a
This world operates on the same
core systems as SAO. It's called
Alfheim Online!
Yui
240031_23_a
Correct!
Yui
240031_22_a
So you're saying that this is a
whole different world from SAO?
Strea
240031_21_a
I turned you into a crystal
and kept you in my inventory.
Kirito
240031_20_a
You and Yui were created as MHCPs
in SAO, right? But because that
world was being destroyed,
Kirito
240031_19_a
Wha...?
Strea
240031_18_a
Strea, I need you to listen to me.
Sword Art Online, the world you're
from...is gone.
Kirito
240031_17_a
Huh?
Why are you crying, Kirito?
What do you mean, "convert"?
Strea
240031_16_a
I'm so glad we were able to
convert her safely!
Kirito
240031_15_a
Strea knows who you are, Daddy!
Yui
240031_14_a
What's wrong, Kirito?
Strea
240031_13_a
That was a good nap... Huh?
Strea
240031_12_a
Hnn...
Aaahh...
Strea
240031_11_a
Yes! It worked!
Kirito
240031_10_a
This is...Strea!
Yui
240031_9_a
Strea!
Kirito
240031_8_a
bg_18_mountain
Hnnn...
Strea
240031_7_a
Yui
240031_6_a
Ah...!
Kirito
240031_5_a
This is how I brought you into ALO,
so it has to work...!
Kirito
240031_4_a
O-Okay, Daddy!
Yui
240031_3_a
Yui
240031_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Let's go, Yui.
Kirito
240031_1_a
Hehe, maybe! If we feel like it.
Yuuki
240028_28_a
I'm just feeling a little left
out, so...maybe include me
every once in a while?
Kirito
240028_27_a
Well, you say that, but when
something like this comes up,
you're the only one we can ask!
Asuna
240028_26_a
C'mon, I can't be the bad guy
EVERY time.
Kirito
240028_25_a
Hm. Not a bad idea.
Sinon
240028_24_a
Yes, please!
Silica
240028_23_a
Great idea! I'm in!
Leafa
240028_22_a
I like these kinds of ladies-only
quests! Quest or not, we should
turn this into a regular meetup!
Liz
240028_21_a
Congrats, Yuuki!
Asuna
240028_20_a
Yep, that does it!
Thanks, guys!
Yuuki
240028_19_a
Either way, we completed the
quest, right?
Silica
240028_18_a
Probably. Otherwise guys wouldn't
take it seriously.
Kirito
240028_17_a
Hm. They must have withheld that
information on purpose.
Asuna
240028_16_a
Oh, well, that's good news!
Yuuki
240028_15_a
penalized when they lose. At least
that's what the info box said when
I died.
Kirito
240028_14_a
Nah. It looks like whoever accepts
terms of the duel doesn't get
Kirito
240028_13_a
Sorry, Kirito.
I hope the penalty wasn't too bad?
Yuuki
240028_12_a
Hehe, looks like we were all
a little upset with Kirito deep
down inside.
Sinon
240028_11_a
Urgh... Augh...
Kirito
240028_10_a
What she said!
You're just being paranoid!
Liz
240028_9_a
Whaaaat?
How could we be mad at you?
Leafa
240028_8_a
I'm getting the sense that some
of those hits actually had some
anger behind them!
Kirito
240028_7_a
Quit ganging up on me like that!
Kirito
240028_6_a
Having said that...
What the heck, guys?!
Kirito
240028_5_a
D-Don't worry, it's fine.
Kirito
240028_4_a
I'm really sorry to put you
through this, Kirito.
Asuna
240028_3_a
Asuna
240028_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
Gugh... I lost!
Kirito
240028_1_a
Wait, you don't mean-?
Asuna
240027_28_a
And let's admit it-we've all
wanted to have a go at him at
one time or another.
Sinon
240027_27_a
Mhm. Someone who can't say no.
Sinon
240027_26_a
Oh?
Got someone in mind, Sinon?
Yuuki
240027_25_a
It shouldn't be.
Sinon
240027_24_a
Finding someone to agree to those
terms might be more difficult
than winning the fight.
Asuna
240027_23_a
Yep, that's what it comes down to.
Liz
240027_22_a
So we have to make a formal
request and then get them to
accept that there'll be a penalty.
Silica
240027_21_a
Uh, yeah, I guess.
Yuuki
240027_20_a
or Half Loss mode duel.
Leafa
240027_19_a
Which means that they can't resign
in the middle of a First Strike
Leafa
240027_18_a
Turns out there was more.
We have to use Total Loss
mode this time.
Yuuki
240027_17_a
What is it, Yuuki?
Asuna
240027_16_a
Oh, whoops!
Yuuki
240027_15_a
Says who? As long as we don't
make it a duel to the death, we
won't get penalized.
Liz
240027_14_a
We can't just go picking on weak-
looking players.
Silica
240027_13_a
Ha ha, oh Liz.
Silica
240027_12_a
So we can just pick some random
weak guy and kick his butt, right?
Liz
240027_11_a
Looks like it.
But this is the last objective!
Yuuki
240027_10_a
Is that the only condition?
Leafa
240027_9_a
Again? That's a bit of a letdown.
Sinon
240027_8_a
Umm...
Looks like we have to take on
a dude in PvP and win?
Yuuki
240027_7_a
It just showed up.
Let me read it again.
Yuuki
240027_6_a
What is it?
Liz
240027_5_a
Yep! We've only got
one more, right?
Asuna
240027_4_a
Liz
240027_3_a
Asuna
240027_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
Awesome!
Another objective down!
Yuuki
240027_1_a
Sounds good!
Yuuki
240025_26_a
We should capitalize on that and
complete the next objective!
Asuna
240025_25_a
Hehe, I'm glad you two are
hitting it off so well!
Yuuki
240025_24_a
Sure did!
Leafa
240025_23_a
using magic showed up, and held
them off with quick attacks
like a real pro.
Sinon
240025_22_a
While Leafa jumped in whenever
a player wielding a bow or
Sinon
240025_21_a
Sinon turned anyone who came near
her into Swiss cheese!
Leafa
240025_20_a
Ahaha!
Leafa
240025_19_a
Ooh! Going the cool-but-a-little-
intimidating route, eh, Sinon?
Liz
240025_18_a
for female players to prove
that they're as good as the men.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
Sinon
240025_17_a
Look, I'm just here because I
heard this quest was a good chance
Sinon
240025_16_a
I wouldn't expect anything less
of a great Sylph warrior and a
gunner who cut her teeth in GGO!
Yuuki
240025_15_a
You've got that right.
Sinon
240025_14_a
Uh-huh! And we barely broke a
sweat, huh, Sinon?
Leafa
240025_13_a
Every player you fought was
a seasoned ALO veteran.
Y-You guys are good!
Asuna
240025_12_a
Not to mention...
Asuna
240025_11_a
Wow! A perfect 8-0 record!
That's incredible...
Silica
240025_10_a
Go right ahead.
Sinon
240025_9_a
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me see your records!
Liz
240025_8_a
progress once you
register your party!
Leafa
240025_7_a
Yep! The cool thing about this
quest is that it starts tracking your
Leafa
240025_6_a
You two have already been out
there taking guys on in PvP
battles, haven't you?
Yuuki
240025_5_a
Don't mention it.
Sinon
240025_4_a
Thanks for helping us out!
Yuuki
240025_3_a
It's Leafa! And she's
got Sinonon with her!
Asuna
240025_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
Hey, everybody! Over here!
Leafa
240025_1_a
Yeah, let's go!
Silica
240023_27_a
I'm in!
Asuna
240023_26_a
Let's do it!
Liz
240023_25_a
Hehe, I like the energy that's
building here! So, what do you say
we check off the next objective?
Yuuki
240023_24_a
Yeah, you've got a point!
Asuna
240023_23_a
and show them what we're really
capable of!
Liz
240023_22_a
That's why now, more than ever,
we've got to take advantage
of events like this
Liz
240023_21_a
I agree with Liz.
I've felt the same thing!
Silica
240023_20_a
And I think some of the guys
look down on us when we play.
Liz
240023_19_a
and, like it or not,
lots of guys play them.
That's just the reality of it.
Liz
240023_18_a
VRMMOs sprang up decades ago
as a natural extension of mainstream
online games,
Liz
240023_17_a
Eh, I don't mind either way!
Liz
240023_16_a
Didn't she, though? Hehe...
Yuuki
240023_15_a
Quit blowing things out of
proportion! Liz never said she'd
"kick the crap" out of anyone!
Asuna
240023_14_a
Geez, Yuuki!
Asuna
240023_13_a
Wait-it's not?
Liz
240023_12_a
it's not a license to go kicking
the crap out of parties full of
dudebros.
Yuuki
240023_11_a
While this campaign quest is
limited to female-only parties,
Yuuki
240023_10_a
Yeah, you're right.
Yuuki
240023_9_a
I feel like we're getting
off-topic...
Asuna
240023_8_a
Liz has been like this since we
got your message! Hahaha!
Silica
240023_7_a
Hehehe... It's times like this
that make me want to show them
how tough women really are!
Liz
240023_6_a
all the guys who think parties
of girls are "cute" what's what!
Liz
240023_5_a
You better believe it!
This quest is a chance to show
Liz
240023_4_a
Wow, Liz, you're raring to go!
Asuna
240023_3_a
No problem! I've been waiting for
a quest like this!
Liz
240023_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
Oh, Liz and Silica are here!
Thanks for coming, guys!
Yuuki
240023_1_a
Ha ha! I don't think that means
what they think it does, though...
Asuna
240021_20_a
Well, I've heard that Girl Power
is the central theme of the quest.
Yuuki
240021_19_a
So, why include that challenge?
Asuna
240021_18_a
Hmm, well if I get to choose,
all the guys I know could make
things pretty easy for me...
Asuna
240021_17_a
Yeah, I think so.
Yuuki
240021_16_a
Are you serious?
Any guy you want?
Asuna
240021_15_a
Oh yeah, you have to fight and
defeat a male player in a duel.
Yuuki
240021_14_a
And, let's see...
Yuuki
240021_13_a
Yeah, I'll break it down for you.
It's part of the campaign, but
the mobs are pretty powerful.
Yuuki
240021_12_a
Can you tell me more about
it so I can tell them what
kind of quest it is?
Asuna
240021_11_a
Yeah, totally!
Yuuki
240021_10_a
Should I tell Liz,
Silica, Leafa, and Sinonon
about this, then?
Asuna
240021_9_a
A ladies-only quest, huh?
Interesting!
Asuna
240021_8_a
So I figured I better start
building a new party.
Yuuki
240021_7_a
Tecchi and the rest of the
guys couldn't join in if
they wanted to!
Yuuki
240021_6_a
We couldn't find a time that
worked for everyone. But this
quest is only for women anyway!
Yuuki
240021_5_a
I'd love to help!
But where are the rest of
the Sleeping Knights?
Asuna
240021_4_a
I've got a quest I want you to
complete with me.
Yuuki
240021_3_a
What is it, Yuuki?
Asuna
240021_2_a
bg_21_alne
Asuna!
Yuuki
240021_1_a
Night.
Kazuto
240018_25_a
Well, I better get to bed.
Goodnight, Kazuto.
Suguha
240018_24_a
Don't worry, I will.
Kazuto
240018_23_a
I don't want her getting
the wrong idea.
Suguha
240018_22_a
Heh, you better get permission
from Asuna first!
Suguha
240018_21_a
Okay. Thank you.
Suguha
240018_20_a
Kazuto...
Suguha
240018_19_a
So I'll take you to see that tree
as many times as you want.
Kazuto
240018_18_a
There's been a lot of distance
between us the last few years.
I'm trying to make up for that.
Kazuto
240018_17_a
Sugu, I...
I always try to be the
best brother I can be.
Kazuto
240018_16_a
Oh my gosh, why would I say that?
This is so embarrassing!
Suguha
240018_15_a
Sugu...
Kazuto
240018_14_a
Er, nothing! Forget I said that!
You didn't hear me say that!
Suguha
240018_13_a
What-?
Kazuto
240018_12_a
I mean, if you and I could go to
somewhere like that together,
that'd be one thing-
Suguha
240018_11_a
I see.
Kazuto
240018_10_a
I know it's not fair to him, but
I don't really want to be with
anyone right now.
Suguha
240018_9_a
You know, I'm pretty sure Recon
just wanted to go with you.
Alone, I mean.
Kazuto
240018_8_a
Hahaha, nope, still not buying it!
Suguha
240018_7_a
No, but I still count as an adult!
I-I'm Yui's dad!
Kazuto
240018_6_a
Calling yourself a "chaperone"
was a stretch, though. You're
not an adult yet, either!
Suguha
240018_5_a
I really like going to see stuff
like that in a group.
Suguha
240018_4_a
Yeah, thanks, Kazuto.
Suguha
240018_3_a
Suguha
240018_2_a
bg_18_suguha_room
So, were you okay with that, Sugu?
Kazuto
240018_1_a
Y-Yay...
Recon
240017_23_a
Yeah!
Kirito
240017_22_a
Okay then, let's get going!
Leafa
240017_21_a
Yes, of course!
Yui
240017_20_a
And if you could also lead us
there, that'd be a big help!
Kirito
240017_19_a
Tell us about the glowing tree
everyone's talking about in the
Sylph territory.
Kirito
240017_18_a
Hi, Daddy!
Yui
240017_17_a
Great! So the three of us-wait,
Yui's here too. Come on out, Yui!
Kirito
240017_16_a
Uh, yeah.
Sure.
Recon
240017_15_a
It's fine! Right, Recon?
Leafa
240017_14_a
U-Umm...
Recon
240017_13_a
Sorry to get in the middle of
things, Recon. I hope this is
okay with you.
Kirito
240017_12_a
Kirito-
Leafa
240017_11_a
So I'm going with you two.
Kirito
240017_10_a
Um, Kirito-?
Recon
240017_9_a
Yep.
You definitely need a chaperone.
Kirito
240017_8_a
You're clearly still just kids,
so I think you need a chaperone.
Kirito
240017_7_a
So, I was going to leave this
to you guys, but um...
Kirito
240017_6_a
...
Leafa
240017_5_a
...
Recon
240017_4_a
Leafa
240017_3_a
Recon
240017_2_a
bg_16_forest_night
...
Kirito
240017_1_a
...
Suguha
240015_29_a
I mean, it's not up to me.
He's asking you, so you two have
to work it out.
Kazuto
240015_28_a
Well, I, uh...
Kazuto
240015_27_a
Picture us, standing there!
All alone by that tree! How would
you feel if that happened?
Suguha
240015_26_a
He might take me to see that
tree, right? How would you feel
about that, huh?
Suguha
240015_25_a
Hm? About what?
Kazuto
240015_24_a
So, what'd you think?
Suguha
240015_23_a
Huh.
Kazuto
240015_22_a
People say it's a good
spot for a date.
Suguha
240015_21_a
Oh, that?
Yeah, I've heard of that place.
Suguha
240015_20_a
and he wanted to know if you'd
like to go see it with him.
Kazuto
240015_19_a
Yeah.
He says there's a rare, glowing
tree in the Sylph forest,
Kazuto
240015_18_a
Did you ask what he wanted?
Suguha
240015_17_a
Well, Recon and I kept waiting
and waiting, but you never showed,
so I came to get you.
Kazuto
240015_16_a
O-Oh...
Kazuto
240015_15_a
I thought I could walk back to
my room like this because you
were still diving!
Suguha
240015_14_a
Wait, why did you log out?
Suguha
240015_13_a
Kazuto
240015_12_a
...
Suguha
240015_11_a
O-Okay, geez!
Kazuto
240015_10_a
Who cares about homework!
Turn around, you perv!
Suguha
240015_9_a
I thought you had homework to do!
Kazuto
240015_8_a
I-I was taking a bath!
Suguha
240015_7_a
Where have you been, Sug-whoa!
What are you doing?!
Kazuto
240015_6_a
Wh-Wh-Whoa!
Kazuto?!
Suguha
240015_5_a
That little liar! She said she'd
dive in after me, but she ran off!
Kazuto
240015_4_a
She's not here...
Where could she have gone?
Kazuto
240015_3_a
...
Kazuto
240015_2_a
bg_18_suguha_room
Hey, Sugu?
Kazuto
240015_1_a
S-Sure thing! Please do!
Recon
240013_20_a
But you might want to let me do
the talking when Leafa gets here.
Kirito
240013_19_a
That's not my call to make.
You'll have to work this out
yourselves.
Kirito
240013_18_a
S-So...
Is that a no?
Recon
240013_17_a
I see.
Kirito
240013_16_a
So I... I was hoping to take
Leafa there tonight, if possible.
Recon
240013_15_a
The wind has to be blowing, too,
but tonight looks like it could
be perfect...
Recon
240013_14_a
There's a short window where
it looks SUPER pretty...
Recon
240013_13_a
There's a tree deep in a forest
in Sylph territory that glows
really beautifully at night...
Recon
240013_12_a
N-No, it's...
Recon
240013_11_a
You're not gonna tell me, are you?
Kirito
240013_10_a
Well...
Recon
240013_9_a
So, what did you want to see
Leafa about?
Kirito
240013_8_a
Er, I mean... Never mind.
Recon
240013_7_a
Oh no?
Kirito
240013_6_a
Today's homework wasn't all that
hard, though...
Recon
240013_5_a
Sorry, Recon.
She said she has homework to do.
Kirito
240013_4_a
Say what?!
I have to tell you first?!
Recon
240013_3_a
Recon
240013_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
So...that's how it is. She...
asked me to talk to you first...
Kirito
240013_1_a
U-Uhh... What?
Kazuto
240011_20_a
You better ask before I
get there! I mean it!
Suguha
240011_19_a
I'll dive as soon as I'm done!
Suguha
240011_18_a
But-! I've, uh, just realized
that I've got homework to finish!
Suguha
240011_17_a
Ask him yourself!
Kazuto
240011_16_a
Will you go ahead
and see what he wants?
Suguha
240011_15_a
Oh yeah?
Kazuto
240011_14_a
Okay, I'll dive, but
I might be a little late.
Suguha
240011_13_a
Hmm... Uhhm...
Suguha
240011_12_a
He didn't say. Maybe he can't say
unless you guys actually meet up.
Kazuto
240011_11_a
So, what did he want?
Suguha
240011_10_a
I see...
Kazuto
240011_9_a
Urgh, I know.
He's not a bad guy. It's just...
Suguha
240011_8_a
Hey, whoa, that's not nice!
Kazuto
240011_7_a
He what?
Erm. Actually, come to think of it...
Maybe I shouldn't.
Suguha
240011_6_a
Cool.
That Recon guy said he
wanted to see you.
Kazuto
240011_5_a
Huh? Oh, yeah!
I'm down!
Suguha
240011_4_a
Want to dive today, Sugu?
Kazuto
240011_3_a
Kazuto
240011_2_a
bg_18_suguha_room
Oh man, I am SO full!
I can't eat any more!
Suguha
240011_1_a
I need to raise my level more...
to protect the Moonlit Black
Cats...
Kirito
210004_2_a
There we go! I've got EXP!
Kirito
210004_1_a
I can drink it to earn a lot
of EXP.
Kirito
210003_1_a
There's a type of item
called an EXP Potion.
Kirito
210002_1_a
Sachi... I'll protect you
and the others, no matter
what.
Kirito
210001_1_a
I should find parties to
work with, and try these
Co-op Quests.
Kirito
209001_2_a
In Co-op Quests, you
team up with other parties
to clear event quests.
Kirito
209001_1_a
I should try to do them all.
Kirito
208002_3_a
They might even drop rare
items, like Nicholas's quest.
Kirito
208002_2_a
There are a lot of new event
quests.
Kirito
208002_1_a
I should give it a try.
Kirito
208001_2_a
This event quest wasn't in
the beta.
Kirito
208001_1_a
You need a copy of the item
to do it. I should come back
when I have copies.
Kirito
207003_2_a
Once you upgrade equipment
to the max, it can be
evolved.
Kirito
207003_1_a
My weapon is stronger!
Kirito
207002_1_a
I should ask a blacksmith
NPC to upgrade my equipment.
Kirito
207001_2_a
I've found a lot of Col and
items...
Kirito
207001_1_a
I've found a strong weapon.
I can't forget to equip it!
Kirito
206003_1_a
>6H
The first one's free.
But you better be back!
Agil
206002_2_a
>6H
Well, hey Kirito!
I've got good deals for you!
Agil
206002_1_a
I'll need new equipment if I
want to back them up.
Kirito
206001_2_a
The Moonlit Black Cats...?
Kirito
206001_1_a
I should equip new weapons
when I find them.
Kirito
205003_2_a
Nice! It's more powerful
than my current weapon.
Kirito
205003_1_a
I should equip it now.
Kirito
205002_2_a
I found a weapon in that
last battle.
Kirito
205002_1_a
I should equip it now.
Kirito
205001_2_a
I found a weapon in that
last battle.
Kirito
205001_1_a
I should form a party with
her. For now, at least.
Kirito
204001_2_a
Asuna...? Seems she's one
of the few girls in SAO.
Kirito
204001_1_a
I should unlock attributes
when I get more
items!
Kirito
203003_2_a
Alright! My HP's increased!
Kirito
203003_1_a
First, I should increase
my HP.
Kirito
203002_2_a
I can use items to unlock
attributes.
Kirito
203002_1_a
It's almost time to face the
boss. I should unlock
attributes beforehand.
Kirito
203001_1_a
When I've saved up enough,
I should scout new party
members.
Kirito
202005_2_a
That was a nice reward!
Kirito
202005_1_a
I should open my rewards
when I clear a quest.
Kirito
202004_2_a
And clearing bonus missions
earns you more gifts.
Kirito
202004_1_a
Rewards for clearing quests
seem to come to the Gift Box.
Kirito
202003_1_a
I should try to do them all.
Kirito
202002_2_a
If I finish NPC requests,
I can earn rewards.

Seems I finished an NPC's
request during that last battle.
Kirito
202001_1_a
Alright, let's head off!
Kirito
201008_1_a
Let's head to Tolbana.
That's where the boss raid
meeting's being held.
Kirito
201007_1_a
Let's head to Tolbana.
That's where the boss raid
meeting's being held.
Kirito
201006_1_a
Time to form a party!
Kirito
201005_1_a
Argo introduced me to a
strong player. I should form
a party with them.
Kirito
201004_1_a
Argo introduced me to a
strong player. I should form
a party with them.
Kirito
201003_1_a
?6h
This time it's on the house.
Accept it as payback for
helping me the other day.
Argo
201002_3_a
Lookin' for some friends?
Then you've come to the right
info broker!
Argo
201002_2_a
?6(
Hey, Kii-boy!
Argo
201002_1_a
I should scout new party
members to help defeat the
boss.
Kirito
201001_3_a
The Floor 1 boss has finally
been found...
Kirito
201001_2_a
It's been a month since SAO
began.
Kirito
201001_1_a
Got it. Thank you!
Kirito
150108_26_a
Just keep an eye out for them
and you'll be fine.
Shaman Player
150108_25_a
I've only ever heard rumors, mind
you. But supposedly they're pretty
nasty.
Shaman Player
150108_24_a
Really? That doesn't sound cool...
Leafa
150108_23_a
But AE's full of people playing
bad guys, and a couple of them
like to overdo it.
Shaman Player
150108_22_a
Alright then.
Kirito
150108_21_a
At any rate, I'm done attacking
you. I certainly can't beat you.
Shaman Player
150108_20_a
Ha ha, well done.
Kirito
150108_19_a
I guess that's a point of pride
for us eccentrics, though.
Shaman Player
150108_18_a
Heh, it definitely leads to some
amusing moments.
Shaman Player
150108_17_a
Which is pretty funny, actually.
Everyone's personality totally
changes after each fight.
Kirito
150108_16_a
That's why we all engage you in
normal conversation when we lose.
Shaman Player
150108_15_a
Hey, we're not actually evil.
We just act evil in-game.
Shaman Player
150108_14_a
That's rich, coming from the
guy who attacked us!
Leafa
150108_13_a
O-Okay, sure.
Kirito
150108_12_a
Don't let all the talk get to you.
Just keep doing what you're doing
and it'll fade.
Shaman Player
150108_11_a
Entertainment, sports, you name
it. The story's always the same.
Shaman Player
150108_10_a
Hah! Come on, a rising star like
you attracts the wrong kind of
attention anywhere they go!
Shaman Player
150108_9_a
So they aren't just out to steal
my kimono?
Kirito
150108_8_a
Oh people are talking about him. 
Leafa
150108_7_a
I knew taking you on was a risk,
but I didn't think you'd take me
down THAT easily.
Shaman Player
150108_6_a
No, but I should've guessed.
I'd heard all the rumors about
Kirito, the noob.
Shaman Player
150108_5_a
Ha ha, didn't expect me to have
an item that can trace curses,
did you?
Kirito
150108_4_a
Kirito
150108_3_a
Leafa
150108_2_a
bg_08_forest
Damn! Ungh...
Shaman Player
150108_1_a
Okay, okay!
Just stop talking...
Kirito
150107_20_a
I wouldn't be surprised if they've
put a bounty of sorts on your
head.
Leafa
150107_19_a
...and just about anyone who's
played a VRMMO knows the name
Kirito by now.
Leafa
150107_18_a
Ahh, I see what you mean.
Not to mention you were
instantly good at this game...
Leafa
150107_17_a
I can't guarantee I haven't made
a few enemies along the way.
Kirito
150107_16_a
I've done a lot of things in a lot
of VRMMOs... Not all of them good.
Kirito
150107_15_a
What's that supposed to mean?
Leafa
150107_14_a
I hope that's all they want...!
Kirito
150107_13_a
They all want that outfit, right?
Leafa
150107_12_a
What can I say?
I'm a real popular guy...
Kirito
150107_11_a
I don't recall getting attacked
this much before you found that
stupid kimono!
Leafa
150107_10_a
Yeah, no kidding!
Leafa
150107_9_a
Urgh... We're totally getting
targeted...
Kirito
150107_8_a
Maybe not. This is an evil
Shaman's ability!
Kirito
150107_7_a
So the attacker might not even be
hiding nearby?!
Leafa
150107_6_a
Some sort of long-distance spell!
Kirito
150107_5_a
What kind of attack is that?!
Leafa
150107_4_a
Augh!
Kirito
150107_3_a
Leafa
150107_2_a
bg_08_forest
Hnh?!
Kirito
150107_1_a
Oh yeah...?
Kirito
150105_15_a
If people find out a noob like you
has that kimono, you're gonna have
a lot of new "friends," get me?
Player
150105_14_a
Geez. Then you REALLY better
watch your back.
Player
150105_13_a
Heh... Yeah, actually.
Kirito
150105_12_a
Wait, you didn't know that before
you went looking for this kimono?
What are you, a noob?
Player
150105_11_a
Yikes... That sounds pretty scary.
Kirito
150105_10_a
There are also Noble Thieves who
can pull off a kind of hit-and-run
thievery, so watch your back.
Player
150105_9_a
Some players have the ability
to steal from another player's
inventory. Mostly bad guys.
Player
150105_8_a
Wait... Stolen how, exactly?
Leafa
150105_7_a
Really? Okay, I'll be on my guard.
Kirito
150105_6_a
I know of a handful who were after
it, so don't let it out of your
sight, lest it get stolen.
Player
150105_5_a
Nice! Supposedly only a select few
players get that outfit.
Player
150105_4_a
Congrats!
Leafa
150105_3_a
Leafa
150105_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
Woo! Another quest cleared.
I got a special New Year's kimono!
Kirito
150105_1_a
Ha ha, I was just kidding!
Kirito
150103_21_a
No way am I gonna be seen walking
around with a Bandit!
Leafa
150103_20_a
Are you nuts?!
Leafa
150103_19_a
I kind of want to see what it's
like to play a bad guy...
Kirito
150103_18_a
Yeah, it sounds pretty deep.
And while I'd love to stay on
the straight and narrow...
Kirito
150103_17_a
I've heard there are standard and
special jobs in the job system.
It's basically its own side quest.
Leafa
150103_16_a
I don't think they're standard
jobs. You have to unlock them
as a job change option.
Leafa
150103_15_a
Though, come to think of it,
I didn't see any options like
that when I picked a job.
Kirito
150103_14_a
Ha ha, yeah, people are really
throwing themselves into these
roles.
Leafa
150103_13_a
There were corrupt merchants too.
Remember how he said "You've got
evil in ya too"?
Kirito
150103_12_a
That's quite a few evil job
classes, if you ask me.
Leafa
150103_11_a
Yeah, but we've got Noble Thieves,
Thugs, and now Bandits... Based on
what Asuna said, anyway.
Leafa
150103_10_a
Well, Japanese sword fighting
dramas have always had villains
and such. It makes sense to me.
Kirito
150103_9_a
Asuka Empire's a trip, isn't it?
What other game has evil roles and
classes for players to assume?
Leafa
150103_8_a
Yeah, exactly. He was actually
pretty nice, all told.
Kirito
150103_7_a
Ah, so Bandit is another job
class, like the Thug who burst
into the dojo for a PvP fight?
Leafa
150103_6_a
Ha ha, it sounds worse than it
was. It was just another player.
Kirito
150103_5_a
You what?! Are you okay?!
Leafa
150103_4_a
Yeah, sorry about that.
I got held up by a Bandit
on the way here.
Kirito
150103_3_a
Kirito
150103_2_a
bg_event_ayakashi_street
There you are, Kirito!
Where have you been?
Leafa
150103_1_a
Heh... I'll keep that in mind.
Kirito
150101_17_a
Besides, I can always jump through
a couple hoops and change jobs
down the line.
Bandit Player
150101_16_a
Eh, it injects a little drama
into the proceedings. I think
it's fun.
Bandit Player
150101_15_a
Wow, is that how the Bandit class
is set up? Sounds rough.
Kirito
150101_14_a
We've gotta make ends meet
somehow!
Bandit Player
150101_13_a
Yeah, yeah...
I've got a hungry family out in
the country to think about too...
Bandit Player
150101_12_a
Numbers never tell the whole story
in a VRMMO. You should be a bit
more careful.
Kirito
150101_11_a
You're pretty strong. I figured I
could take you based on your
level. You looked like a noob.
Bandit Player
150101_10_a
I'm okay with that. I still get
plenty of points for driving you
off.
Kirito
150101_9_a
Okay, I picked the wrong guy to
mess with. Just spare me the
death penalty, eh?
Bandit Player
150101_8_a
Looks like I won that one.
Had enough?
Kirito
150101_7_a
Kirito
150101_6_a
HYAAAAAAH!
Kirito
150101_5_a
RAAAAAH!
Bandit Player
150101_4_a
Sorry, that's not happening!
Kirito
150101_3_a
Kirito
150101_2_a
bg_02_forest
Hand over everything you've got!
Bandit Player
150101_1_a
Thank you, Alice! Woohoo!
Eugeo
150088_33_a
Eugeo
150088_32_a
I...suppose that is a...somewhat
valid way of looking at things...
Very well. We may play.
Alice
150088_31_a
Asuna's right. Don't focus on the
negative, think of the positive!
Make happy memories while you can!
Kirito
150088_30_a
Besides, I think they'll treasure
the time they got to spend with
you.
Asuna
150088_29_a
I know that saying goodbye hurts,
but I think these kids can handle
it when the day comes.
Asuna
150088_28_a
Kirito
150088_27_a
Hehehe, I think we can play for
just a liiittle bit longer, right?
Asuna
150088_26_a
H-Hey, I thought I said it was
time to go home! Where are you--
Come back here this instant!
Alice
150088_25_a
Alice, you too! Let's play!
Child C
150088_24_a
Eugeo, come play with us!
Child B
150088_23_a
I... You... But...
sigh
I really blew it, didn't I?
Eugeo
150088_22_a
They told me about that when they
saw me watching their children.
You should have said something.
Alice
150088_21_a
I was not proposing you abandon
your duties, or break your promise
to their parents.
Alice
150088_20_a
Yes, stay away from them. As in,
watch over them from a distance,
but still within sight.
Alice
150088_19_a
N-Now hold on, you were the one
who told me to stay away from
them...
Eugeo
150088_18_a
When I saw them heading out of
town, I quickly followed to ensure
their safety.
Alice
150088_17_a
Because you shirked your duty and
didn't keep an eye on them, I had
to do it myself.
Alice
150088_16_a
It was mere chance I ran across
them. You were irresponsible to
let them out of your sight.
Alice
150088_15_a
Alice, you found them!
Oh, I'm so relieved...
Eugeo
150088_14_a
You're late, Eugeo.
Alice
150088_13_a
Yaaay! It's Eugeo!
Eugeo, come play with us!!
Child A
150088_12_a
Alice
150088_11_a
Kids, we've been looking all over--
ALICE?! What are you doing here?!
Eugeo
150088_10_a
It's the missing kids!
Asuna
150088_9_a
Asuna
150088_8_a
Look, over there!
Kirito
150088_7_a
sigh
... How did I end up doing
this again?
Alice
150088_6_a
No, I dun wanna! I wanna play
more with you, Alice!
Child C
150088_5_a
Now, kids, it's time to head home.
Alice
150088_4_a
No, that's boring!
I wanna go pick flowers!
Child B
150088_3_a
Alice
150088_2_a
bg_01_field
I wanna play tag next!
Child A
150088_1_a
And we'll help you do it!
Kirito
150087_23_a
I...didn't think of that...
Oh no, what have I done!
I have to find them!
Eugeo
150087_22_a
...
Eugeo
150087_21_a
Yeah, but would those kids have
gone missing if you were there
to watch out for them?
Kirito
150087_20_a
My reasons don't change the fact
that she was right...
Eugeo
150087_19_a
Yeah, I'm sure she would've left
you alone if she knew...
Asuna
150087_18_a
Oh, seriously? Why didn't you just
tell Alice that?
Kirito
150087_17_a
That's why they asked me to play
with them and keep them company.
Eugeo
150087_16_a
Their parents were really busy
getting ready for Christmas, so
they couldn't keep an eye on them.
Eugeo
150087_15_a
Hey Eugeo, I have a question...
How did you meet those kids,
anyway?
Kirito
150087_14_a
I'm always ready!
Kirito
150087_13_a
Yeah! Are you both ready to head
out, or do you need a minute?
Asuna
150087_12_a
Come on, we've got to find them!
Eugeo
150087_11_a
Asuna and I chatted with them, so
that could explain why this just
appeared in our quest log...
Kirito
150087_10_a
Hmm... Do you think this quest has
something to do with those kids
Eugeo was playing with?
Kirito
150087_9_a
Totally! And hey, the quest
triggered for me too!
Kirito
150087_8_a
Children have gone missing?!
We have to save them!
Eugeo
150087_7_a
It's a quest to find lost kids?
That's kind of...vague?
Kirito
150087_6_a
A quest just popped up!
Apparently, some kids left town,
and no one's seen them since!
Asuna
150087_5_a
What's the problem, Asuna?
Kirito
150087_4_a
Eugeo
150087_3_a
Kirito
150087_2_a
bg_03_forest1
Kirito, Eugeo! We've got trouble!
Asuna
150087_1_a
Where are those kids going...?
Alice
150085_20_a
...
Alice
150085_19_a
Yeah, and then we can play and
play and play! It'll be great!
Child C
150085_18_a
I know! Let's go find him!
I bet he'll be so happy to see us!
Child B
150085_17_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Eugeo hasn't come to play with us
in forever... Maybe he's really
busy?
Child A
150085_16_a
Eugeo
150085_15_a
Eugeo...
Kirito
150085_14_a
I guess I was trying to pretend
that it would last forever...
Eugeo
150085_13_a
Yeah...
Kirito
150085_12_a
When that day comes, we'll have
to bid all our friends here
goodbye...
Eugeo
150085_11_a
One day, after we find all of the
Divine Objects, Alice and I will
have to go back to our own world.
Eugeo
150085_10_a
And she's totally right.
She and I, we don't belong here.
Eugeo
150085_9_a
Uh, just now...?
Kirito
150085_8_a
Alice scolded me the other day.
She said I shouldn't get too
friendly with the locals...
Eugeo
150085_7_a
No. The truth is...
Eugeo
150085_6_a
You're not playing with those
kids today?
Kirito
150085_5_a
Hey, Kirito...
Eugeo
150085_4_a
Oh, hey there.
Kirito
150085_3_a
Kirito
150085_2_a
bg_03_forest1
...
Eugeo
150085_1_a
Alice, wait!
Asuna
150083_21_a
I...will share this epiphany with
Eugeo posthaste.
Alice
150083_20_a
...
Alice
150083_19_a
So in short, you don't want those
kids to be sad when you leave.
How nice of you.
Kirito
150083_18_a
That is why befriending them
now is an act of reckless and
self-serving cruelty.
Alice
150083_17_a
Those children do not.
Alice
150083_16_a
We understand each other's fates
and why a day of parting must
surely come.
Alice
150083_15_a
I mean, I'm going to be really
sad when Alice and Eugeo leave...
Asuna
150083_14_a
But we're no different, right?
Asuna
150083_13_a
Hmm... I see her point, though.
The more they like him, the sadder
they'll be when he leaves.
Kirito
150083_12_a
That's...a bit harsh,
don't you think?
Asuna
150083_11_a
His befriending them now will
only cause them undue suffering
at a later date.
Alice
150083_10_a
It's troubling, is what it is.
One day, we'll have to return
to our own world.
Alice
150083_9_a
Hehe, I'm not surprised he has a
little fan club. Isn't it so cute
how all those kids just love him?
Asuna
150083_8_a
It...appears that he's made a
number of very small friends.
Alice
150083_7_a
Sorry, didn't notice... Everything
okay? You're glaring at Eugeo
pretty hard.
Kirito
150083_6_a
I was standing right there.
Alice
150083_5_a
Oh, hey Alice. I didn't know you
were here.
Asuna
150083_4_a
Kirito
150083_3_a
Asuna
150083_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
Hello.
Alice
150083_1_a
Yeah...
Kirito
150081_18_a
I just hope that whatever weird
power he's got, it doesn't cause
him or Alice any trouble...
Asuna
150081_17_a
It sounds crazy, but I get that
feeling too.
Asuna
150081_16_a
I sort of get the feeling that the
world just rewrites itself around
him...
Kirito
150081_15_a
Maybe Eugeo's special somehow,
and has the power to change
AIs just by being near them.
Kirito
150081_14_a
I know what you mean. It's like
basic NPCs are suddenly advanced
AIs when they're with him.
Asuna
150081_13_a
But it's weird, right? I feel like
a lot of NPCs only ever act this
naturally around Eugeo.
Kirito
150081_12_a
Hehehe. There's always more
where that came from.
Asuna
150081_11_a
Low blow, Asuna. Low blow.
Kirito
150081_10_a
Eugeo's got class, social skills,
and is great with kids--unlike a
certain solo player I know.
Asuna
150081_9_a
I know, right? I can't believe
he's so good with them!
Asuna
150081_8_a
Asuna
150081_7_a
Wow, Eugeo's crazy popular with
the kids.
Kirito
150081_6_a
Ahahaha... Easy now, kids,
one at a time!
Eugeo
150081_5_a
Hide and seek!
Child C
150081_4_a
Let's play pretend!
Child B
150081_3_a
Eugeo
150081_2_a
bg_event_christmas_town
What do you wanna play next,
Eugeo?!
Child A
150081_1_a
Yes, ma'am!
Kirito
150068_22_a
Guard my back out there, Kirito!
You got that?!
Sinon
150068_21_a
Heh. I can't back down now.
Fine, you win. Let's do this.
Sinon
150068_20_a
Just use those skills and you'll
be fine out there.
Kirito
150068_19_a
We'll be fine. Since you started
playing ALO, you're way better
at fighting close up.
Kirito
150068_18_a
That's not it, it's just...
Sinon
150068_17_a
What, Sinon? You don't think I
can cover you?
Kirito
150068_16_a
But...
Sinon
150068_15_a
Hit 'em hard and fast, and they'll
be too shocked to fight back. We
break through and find Epidanthia!
Kirito
150068_14_a
Well, it'll take them by surprise
at least, right? And it's our
only hope right now, I think.
Kirito
150068_13_a
H-Hold on a second! That's way too
dangerous!
Sinon
150068_12_a
Let's stick together and blow
right through their lines. You
cover my back, and I cover yours.
Kirito
150068_11_a
Okay, smart guy, then what do
we do?
Sinon
150068_10_a
They probably have a bunch of
people ready to charge you once
you're alone and vulnerable.
Kirito
150068_9_a
Hmm... Well, the enemy expects
that, right?
Kirito
150068_8_a
Then I take them out from afar,
one by one. What else can we do
with our loadouts?
Sinon
150068_7_a
To be blunt, normally, you just
leap around like an idiot and
cause havoc on their lines.
Sinon
150068_6_a
And how do you propose we do that?
There's only so much we can do
with just the two of us.
Sinon
150068_5_a
So we just have to use that
knowledge against them.
Kirito
150068_4_a
Ouch. Well, they know how we
usually fight now.
Kirito
150068_3_a
Kirito
150068_2_a
bg_s2_11_cave
No. So, how do we slip out
of here...?
Sinon
150068_1_a
Ha ha, isn't that just part of
what makes me so wonderful?
Kirito
150067_18_a
sigh
... How do you maintain that
boundless optimism of yours?
Sinon
150067_17_a
You're right. We've always fought
with just the two of us. We'll be
fine.
Kirito
150067_16_a
Now that they're gone, we'll just
have to go back to our old team
tactics.
Sinon
150067_15_a
I got used to fighting with them
here in the Monolith.
Sinon
150067_14_a
N-No, that's not it at all!
It's just...
Sinon
150067_13_a
Hahaha, is my favorite ice-cold
sniper worried about them?
Kirito
150067_12_a
Yeah, but it's going to take a
while to find Epidanthia and Orchis
again...
Sinon
150067_11_a
I guess they haven't realized
we're hiding in here...yet...
Kirito
150067_10_a
bg_s2_11_cave
Phew...
Sinon
150067_9_a
Got it!
Kirito
150067_8_a
Y-Yeah! Let's take cover in those
ruins!
Sinon
150067_7_a
They're trying to split us up!
Sinon! We need to stay together!
Kirito
150067_6_a
Kirito! We've been separated from
Epidanthia and Orchis!
Sinon
150067_5_a
This isn't good!
Kirito
150067_4_a
Sinon
150067_3_a
Kirito
150067_2_a
bg_s2_09_ruins
Keep the pressure on!
Go go go!!
Players
150067_1_a
You bet. Force them to split up,
then kill 'em slowly, one by one!
Player B
150065_36_a
You've got a plan?
Player A
150065_35_a
If we get enough guys together,
we can take them.
Player B
150065_34_a
Yeah, but now we know there are
only three of 'em.
Player B
150065_33_a
Bah... I can't believe we got
beat by just three people...
Player A
150065_32_a
Kirito
150065_31_a
I know a few of those guys too.
She's probably right.
Sinon
150065_30_a
Sinon
150065_29_a
Really...?
Kirito
150065_28_a
They're definitely gonna come back
for revenge.
Epidanthia
150065_27_a
I've met some of the guys we just
took out, and they're annoyingly
persistent.
Epidanthia
150065_26_a
Orchis
150065_25_a
Don't forget, I'm a GGO veteran,
so I'm in the know.
Epidanthia
150065_24_a
Sinon
150065_23_a
What do you mean?
Kirito
150065_22_a
Orchis
150065_21_a
Yeaaah, but I think we might've
gone too far.
Epidanthia
150065_20_a
For now. Really, though, our
teamwork back there was perfect.
Sinon
150065_19_a
Sinon
150065_18_a
Great. That means we're clear to
explore.
Kirito
150065_17_a
Epidanthia
150065_16_a
I checked, and we managed to push
out most of the players who
entered the Monolith.
Orchis
150065_15_a
Kirito
150065_14_a
Nngh! Retreat! Retreaaat!!
Player B
150065_13_a
Nice teamwork, everyone!
Kirito
150065_12_a
Nnraaagh!
Player B
150065_9_a
Sinon
150065_11_a
Orchis
150065_10_a
You got it.
Sinon
150065_8_a
Sinon
150065_7_a
Sinon!
Covering fire!
Orchis
150065_6_a
Epidanthia
150065_5_a
Hit her now! She's defenseless!
Player B
150065_4_a
Urk!!
Player A
150065_3_a
There's more where
that came from!
Epidanthia
150065_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
Hyaaah!!
Kirito
150065_1_a
Orchis
150063_32_a
Ehehehe! Let's get 'em!
Epidanthia
150063_31_a
I'm in.
Sinon
150063_30_a
I'd love to remove those guys
over there from the playing field.
Kirito
150063_29_a
Sinon
150063_28_a
Anyway... You guys want to try the
ol' ambush strat?
Kirito
150063_27_a
Epidanthia
150063_26_a
No need to apologize, I don't mind
the oversight.
Orchis
150063_25_a
Kirito
150063_24_a
Ah, yes. Sorry, Orchis. Your
intel is going to help a lot,
I'm sure.
Sinon
150063_23_a
Orchis
150063_22_a
Sinon, don't forget Orchis, 'kay?
Epidanthia
150063_21_a
In GGO, we're the perfect party.
Sinon
150063_20_a
We've got a balanced offense and
defense, and we cover each other's
weaknesses.
Kirito
150063_19_a
not to mention your terrifying
STR/VIT build holding the line, we
are a force to be reckoned with.
Kirito
150063_18_a
Sinon
150063_17_a
Well... Okay, I can't deny that.
With Sinon sniping and me handling
the close-combat,
Kirito
150063_16_a
Orchis
150063_15_a
I'm not. You know how good I am,
Kiri-poo. And together, we make
an unbeatable team.
Epidanthia
150063_14_a
Sinon
150063_13_a
Don't get cocky, Epidanthia.
Kirito
150063_12_a
Besides, we got Orchis feeding us
intel. We can handle these losers.
Epidanthia
150063_11_a
Come on, you worry too much.
I'm invincible, and I have you two
backing me up.
Epidanthia
150063_9_a
Orchis
150063_10_a
And they're going to be ready for
us. No easy pickings today.
Sinon
150063_8_a
Sinon
150063_7_a
Sounds like people know we're
here.
Kirito
150063_6_a
Roger that. I'll keep my eyes out.
Player A
150063_5_a
Odds are they're lurking around,
ready to ambush us and hog all
the treasure for themselves.
Player B
150063_4_a
Yeah, but we can't let our guard
down. Someone supposedly beat
us here.
Player B
150063_3_a
There's rare mats and items just
lying around for the taking!
Player A
150063_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
Heh, this area's awesome!
Player A
150063_1_a
Orchis
150061_24_a
I'm with you two. I got a bad
feeling about this.
Epidanthia
150061_23_a
Nor should we try. Let's find a
good, hidden vantage point and
see how this will play out.
Sinon
150061_22_a
Sinon
150061_21_a
Yikes... I doubt they're all
working together, but we still
can't take them down ourselves.
Kirito
150061_20_a
O-Over a HUNDRED already?!
We should never have jinxed it...
Epidanthia
150061_19_a
Epidanthia
150061_18_a
Everyone, I have information.
As of now, over one hundred
players have entered the Monolith.
Orchis
150061_17_a
And then it'll be a free-for-all
over all these resources.
Sinon
150061_16_a
But that just means that people
are going to be swarming this
place soon.
Kirito
150061_15_a
Sinon
150061_14_a
Yeah... We're only finding so much
rare loot because we were the
first ones here.
Kirito
150061_13_a
Orchis
150061_12_a
Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows,
or cares? Either way, we've got
a lot of work to do.
Epidanthia
150061_11_a
Doesn't that mean the devs put
this area in here a long time ago,
and people just uncovered it?
Sinon
150061_10_a
But didn't people find this area
by accident during a gunfight?
Sinon
150061_9_a
Sinon
150061_8_a
It's all-new, so they have to
pack it full of stuff people want.
Kirito
150061_7_a
Orchis
150061_6_a
I was pretty shocked when I got
here too. This is, like, the best
gathering spot in all of GGO now.
Epidanthia
150061_5_a
The SBC Monolith seems to be
packed with rare items.
Sinon
150061_4_a
That's a pretty rare material.
This new area, seriously...
Sinon
150061_3_a
Sinon
150061_2_a
bg_s2_01_wilderness
Whoa, look at what I just found.
Kirito
150061_1_a
Heh, you said it, Agil!
Klein
150048_22_a
Our memories of SAO, whether
happy or sad, will live on inside
us forever.
Agil
150048_21_a
It was. Even the bad times, well,
they just made us stronger.
Agil
150048_20_a
SAO was an unforgettable
experience for you, wasn't it?
For all SAO survivors.
Seven
150048_19_a
I guess it might...
Klein
150048_18_a
Maybe the song triggered some
feeling or memory that amplified
its effect?
Seven
150048_17_a
She said she came up with the song
after hearing an SAO survivor
hum a melody...
Seven
150048_16_a
Really? Interesting, the girl who
wrote the song mentioned something
about SAO.
Seven
150048_15_a
Same. I think it was from SAO?
My memory's fuzzy, but I recall
someone singing it in town...
Agil
150048_14_a
Oh... Er, that song just sounded
vaguely familiar. It took me by
surprise.
Klein
150048_13_a
Why?
Seven
150048_12_a
Hey, I have a question... When you
first heard my song, you acted
reaaal weird for a minute.
Seven
150048_11_a
Exactly.
Seven
150048_10_a
You mean it's too strong?
Agil
150048_9_a
These numbers... They should be
impossible. Something's off.
Seven
150048_8_a
Seven, everything all right?
This is good news, right?
Don't look so blue.
Klein
150048_7_a
...
Seven
150048_6_a
I'm a little bit surprised that
song was so powerful.
Pooka
150048_5_a
Seven
150048_4_a
Agil
150048_3_a
Klein
150048_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Wow, according to the data,
the buff was a smashing success.
Pooka
150048_1_a
You focus!
Agil
150047_21_a
Agil! Focus! It's stomping time!
Klein
150047_20_a
L-Look out!
Seven
150047_19_a
Grraaagh!!
Monster
150047_18_a
Yeah... Attack, sure...
Agil
150047_17_a
Oh... Right...
Klein
150047_16_a
Um... Earth to bodyguards?
You alive?
Hey, is this mic on?
Seven
150047_15_a
...
Agil
150047_14_a
...
Klein
150047_13_a
Alright, you can attack now!
I'll just be over here analyzing
your DPS!
Seven
150047_12_a
...
Agil
150047_11_a
...
Klein
150047_10_a
La la la!
Seven
150047_9_a
Yeah, I got it!
Come on, Seven! Let's hear it!
Klein
150047_8_a
Hold up, you two! Don't attack
until after you get my song buff.
Seven
150047_7_a
Shh, chill out, and don't say
anything. Just be grateful she
let you come.
Agil
150047_6_a
Heh, too slow!
Now behold my ultimate power!
Klein
150047_5_a
Seven
150047_4_a
Agil
150047_3_a
Klein
150047_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Grawrgh!!
Monster
150047_1_a
You really don't know when to
keep your mouth shut.
Agil
150045_30_a
B-But why?!
Klein
150045_29_a
RRRAAAGH! KLEIN!
GO. HOME!
Seven
150045_28_a
Is to see my glorious idol Seven
sparkling on the stage like a
Klein
150045_27_a
Nah. I'm not particularly dying
to hear you sing again.
Now, what I really want...
Klein
150045_26_a
Well... I haven't sung that much
around people lately, so I'm not
sure how good I'll be...
Seven
150045_25_a
...Really? You...want to hear me
sing again that badly?
Seven
150045_24_a
And I... I'm wild about helping
you write a song, Seven!
Klein
150045_23_a
But I said you don't even have to
pay me! Good deeds are their own
reward!
Klein
150045_22_a
Agil here's the only bodyguard
we need. And he's more pleasant
company.
Seven
150045_21_a
D-Dude! But why?!
Klein
150045_20_a
Agil
150045_19_a
Klein
150045_18_a
Definitely not.
Seven
150045_17_a
Klein
150045_16_a
Right, whatever you say. 
sigh
I just hope she doesn't reject
you out of hand.
Agil
150045_15_a
Dude, you're working for SEVEN?!
I don't even need cash!
I'm just happy to help!
Klein
150045_14_a
Great, but I'll need to check with
my employers first. That's Seven,
by the way. It's her call.
Agil
150045_13_a
Okay, that sounds like fun!
I'm totally down to help!
Klein
150045_12_a
Well, Pooka make terrible
fighters, so that's where I come
in.
Agil
150045_11_a
I'm what you'd call a bodyguard.
Pooka need to fight to test some
of their buffs.
Agil
150045_10_a
Yeah, I get that. But okay, let's
talk about you. You're not a
Pooka. Why are YOU here?
Klein
150045_9_a
She's been through a lot,
that girl. Her outlook's changed.
Agil
150045_8_a
She told me that she doesn't care
why, where, or for who anymore.
She just wants to sing.
Agil
150045_7_a
It's hard to believe THE Seven who
took the world by storm is hanging
out, helping total amateurs.
Klein
150045_6_a
Wow...
She's really something, huh?
Klein
150045_5_a
She was a pro, after all.
Her insight's valuable, and her
singing is top-notch.
Agil
150045_4_a
It sounds like that band over
there is making a song, and
Seven's helping them compose it.
Agil
150045_3_a
Agil
150045_2_a
bg_02_fountain
So... Why's Seven here?
Klein
150045_1_a
Alright, see you guys around!
Seven
150043_22_a
Panyatona!
I'll be there in a second!
Seven
150043_21_a
Seven! We've been waiting for you!
We made the changes you
suggested. Mind joining us?
Pooka
150043_20_a
Wow. Cool.
Klein
150043_19_a
A lot of these Pooka are here day
and night practicing.
Agil
150043_18_a
They compose a song, then try it
out on the spot to see how well
the buff works.
Seven
150043_17_a
Well, the Pooka here aren't just
singers
they're songwriters.
Seven
150043_16_a
Yeah, that's the Pooka race's
primary ability.
Klein
150043_15_a
Well, buff power is affected by
how good of a singer you are,
and by how good the song is.
Seven
150043_14_a
I'll be nice and tell you why.
You at least remember that Pooka
can buff people by singing, right?
Seven
150043_13_a
And you're just realizing that
now? Talk about oblivious.
Seven
150043_12_a
Oh, cool. Come to think of it,
there are a lot of Pooka wandering
around here...
Klein
150043_11_a
I've got a bit of business with
some of these Pooka musicians.
Agil
150043_10_a
A job, you say?
Klein
150043_9_a
It's okay, Klein, we're used to it.
So, while you're here, how about
helping me with a job?
Agil
150043_8_a
Yeah yeah, I get it.
I'm a terrible person. 
sigh
Klein
150043_7_a
...So in other words, Klein made
an idiot of himself again.
Agil
150043_6_a
Hey, it's my favorite barista!
Listen to this!
Seven
150043_5_a
A-Agil!
Klein
150043_4_a
Seven
150043_3_a
Klein
150043_2_a
bg_02_fountain
So...what exactly is going
on here?
Agil
150043_1_a
W-Wait up, Seven! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean it!!
Klein
150041_18_a
Ugh, you really are the WORST.
Plokho!
Seven
150041_17_a
Once you get to know a celebrity,
the dream just sorta dies,
you know?
Klein
150041_16_a
You know, about that... It's kind
of hard to explain, but...
Klein
150041_15_a
So, what? Aren't you happy to be
friends with someone you idolized?
Seven
150041_14_a
H-Hey, it's not like that...
Besides, you're not singing
anymore, so...
Klein
150041_13_a
Do you have a short list of lame
pickup lines you recycle?
You're the worst.
Seven
150041_12_a
And "musical muse," my foot!
You tried the same tired line
on me when I was an idol!
Seven
150041_11_a
Ahh! Where did you
S-Seven?!
Klein
150041_9_a
Seven
150041_10_a
Seriously, Klein,
are you still at it?
???
150041_8_a
Wha
Ah... Ahh!
Wait for me, my musical muse!
Klein
150041_7_a
Uh... Er...
Gotta go, bye!
Pooka Girl
150041_6_a
May I request a...private concert?
Klein
150041_5_a
Then again, I would expect no less
from a Pooka. However, I find your
singing particularly...bewitching.
Klein
150041_4_a
Excuse me?
Pooka Girl
150041_3_a
Excuse me, miss, but I couldn't
help but notice that you have
the voice of an angel.
???
150041_2_a
bg_02_fountain
La la la!
Pooka Girl
150041_1_a
You said it.
Kirito
150028_24_a
And with that, they all stopped
trying to murder each other.
The end.
Eugeo
150028_23_a
We, uh, appreciate it.
We...won't try to stab
you anymore either.
Townsperson
150028_22_a
Just to clear the waters, we won't
eat you or anything. That would
be terribly rude of us, after all.
Werewolf
150028_21_a
Ha ha, glad all that got resolved.
Kirito
150028_20_a
Hey, think nothing of it. Turn the
other cheek and all that. No hard
feelings, eh?
Werewolf
150028_19_a
We... We didn't realize.
We're sorry we tried to kill you.
Townsperson
150028_18_a
And we have you to thank for that.
Werewolf
150028_17_a
Ha ha, wow! Now that's confusing!
But whatever combination of things
you are, I'm glad you're not dead.
Eugeo
150028_16_a
Now, instead of humans who turn
into werewolves, we're wolves who
turn into werehumans.
Werewolf
150028_15_a
However, when the curse on this
forsaken castle was lifted, things
apparently...changed.
Werewolf
150028_14_a
You have our sincerest apologies
for the confusion. You see, we
were werewolves. Past tense.
Werewolf
150028_13_a
Yes, that's correct.
Yui
150028_12_a
Aren't werewolves people who turn
into beastmen during the full
moon?
Kirito
150028_11_a
They turned back to werewolves
when the...moon rose? Waaait a
sec, that doesn't seem right...
Kirito
150028_10_a
Of course...
I should have realized...
Kirito
150028_9_a
Werewolves? Ooooh, that makes
so much sense. I knew they weren't
fairies.
Eugeo
150028_8_a
What the-?! The wolves turned
into fairies?! No, wait! They're
werewolves!
Townsperson
150028_7_a
W-We're back!
Werewolf
150028_6_a
Grrr?!
Wolf
150028_5_a
What's happening?!
Eugeo
150028_4_a
Yui
150028_3_a
Eugeo
150028_2_a
bg_16_sky_night
I ain't sayin' nothin'!
Kirito
150028_1_a
O-Oh yeah, I forgot...
But then what's the trigger?
Kirito
150027_20_a
Kirito, what are you talking
about? We already figured out
they can't be fairies!
Eugeo
150027_19_a
Are you insane?
Townsperson
150027_18_a
These wolves...were fairies!
Kirito
150027_17_a
They can only respond to specific
keywords... But what's the keyword
to stop this?!
Kirito
150027_16_a
Yeah, they're basic event NPCs.
They don't have AIs.
Kirito
150027_15_a
Daddy, these people...!
Yui
150027_14_a
Are you insane?
Townsperson
150027_13_a
But they're not wolves!
Kirito
150027_12_a
If you're not going to help, stay
out of our way! We're getting rid
of them, and that's that!
Townsperson
150027_11_a
Why are you trying to protect
wolves?! They're wild animals!
Townsperson
150027_10_a
Huh? Are you insane?
Townsperson
150027_9_a
Listen to me! You can't hurt
these wolves!
Eugeo
150027_8_a
We're not out of the woods yet,
Eugeo. We've got to stop that mob!
Kirito
150027_7_a
We made it just in time!
Eugeo
150027_6_a
Stop! All of you, stop!
Kirito
150027_5_a
Grrr...
Wolf
150027_4_a
Yeah! Get 'em! Kill the wolves!
Mob
150027_3_a
Come on! If we work together,
we can deal with these wolves
ourselves!
Townsperson
150027_2_a
bg_03_forest1_sunset
We found them! Over here!
Townsperson
150027_1_a
You're right!
We need to find them, quick!
Eugeo
150025_36_a
That means... Those wolves are in
danger!
Kirito
150025_35_a
Yeah, that's what started this
whole thing. They asked us to
hunt them down.
Eugeo
150025_34_a
Hmm... Hey, you said some fairies
told you they were frightened of
a pack of wolves, right?
Kirito
150025_33_a
Yeah...
Eugeo
150025_32_a
But if those wolves used to be
people, that explains why they
didn't attack us.
Kirito
150025_31_a
I have no idea.
Kirito
150025_30_a
But then who lived here? Who got
turned into wolves?
Eugeo
150025_29_a
And as you pointed out, fairies
just started settling this island.
This town has been here a while...
Kirito
150025_28_a
Exactly. I don't think fairy
pioneers got gobbled up by wolves.
There's no sign of a struggle.
Kirito
150025_27_a
You think that the people living
in this village got turned into
wolves...right?
Eugeo
150025_26_a
Yeah... I'm with you on this.
Eugeo
150025_25_a
Eugeo... This might be real bad.
Kirito
150025_24_a
Huh? But that means...!
Eugeo
150025_23_a
Look at this.
Wolf fur, just like by our trap.
Kirito
150025_22_a
Knew what?
Eugeo
150025_21_a
I knew it...
Kirito
150025_20_a
Fairies have only just begun
settling the island, and I doubt
they'd have built a town here...
Eugeo
150025_19_a
Hmm... Strange. Only monsters
and demons lived around this
castle until recently...
Eugeo
150025_18_a
Or at least, were here recently.
Eugeo
150025_17_a
No, they look pretty well-kept.
There's definitely signs that
people are living here.
Eugeo
150025_16_a
But I don't see anyone living
here. Do you think they've
been abandoned?
Kirito
150025_15_a
Cottages? Out here in the middle
of the forest?
Eugeo
150025_14_a
Huh... Hey Eugeo, look over there.
Kirito
150025_13_a
Interesting... Well, these wolves
do seem unnaturally intelligent...
Eugeo
150025_12_a
This scholar described a wolf pack
whose leader was apparently as
clever as any human.
Kirito
150025_11_a
You know, when I was kid, I read a
book about a famous scholar
who studied wild animals.
Kirito
150025_10_a
Also true...
Eugeo
150025_9_a
And they saw through our trap...
Kirito
150025_8_a
Yeah. The way they studied us
when we first saw them...
Wheels were definitely turning.
Eugeo
150025_7_a
I was just thinking...
Those wolves are REALLY smart.
Kirito
150025_6_a
Alright, Kirito, what's on your
mind?
Eugeo
150025_5_a
Wait...
Kirito
150025_4_a
We've been searching the forest
for hours, and we haven't seen
hide nor hair of them.
Eugeo
150025_3_a
Kirito
150025_2_a
bg_03_forest1_sunset
Where do you think those wolves
are hiding?
Eugeo
150025_1_a
Wait...
Kirito
150023_23_a
It also means that none of them
fell for it.
Eugeo
150023_22_a
That means the pack walked
right past our trap.
Eugeo
150023_21_a
A tuft of wolf fur, and a lot of
tracks in the mud...
Kirito
150023_20_a
No, Kirito, look here...
Eugeo
150023_19_a
You're kidding me! Nothing?
So the plan was a bust?
Kirito
150023_18_a
Look!
Eugeo
150023_17_a
It's been a couple of hours.
Some of those wolves might've
come looking for a snack.
Kirito
150023_16_a
bg_03_forest1_sunset
I wonder if we caught anything
yet...
Eugeo
150023_15_a
So, we just set this like so,
and...done! Now we play the
waiting game.
Kirito
150023_14_a
No, I bought a whole bunch of
these cage traps. There are at
least a dozen wolves, after all.
Kirito
150023_13_a
I think that's a great idea.
But is this the only trap you got?
Eugeo
150023_12_a
So I thought we could catch them
one by one, then figure out what
to do with them.
Kirito
150023_11_a
So I thought it'd be pretty rude
if we suddenly attacked them.
But we can't just leave them be.
Kirito
150023_10_a
Yeah, it's nice and non-violent.
Those wolves didn't attack us,
right?
Kirito
150023_9_a
Interesting... So when something
bites the bait, the door slams
shut.
Eugeo
150023_8_a
A giant cage? Cool.
There's even a hook
to hang bait from.
Eugeo
150023_7_a
Here, check this out.
Kirito
150023_6_a
Traps, mostly.
To catch wild animals.
Kirito
150023_5_a
What sort of things?
Eugeo
150023_4_a
I just stopped by the village to
pick up some things.
Kirito
150023_3_a
Kirito
150023_2_a
bg_03_forest1
So what was this errand you had
to run, Kirito?
Eugeo
150023_1_a
It felt like they were checking
us out. Weird...
Kirito
150021_20_a
Apparently they weren't looking
for a fight, huh?
Eugeo
150021_19_a
Umm... Bye, I guess?
Eugeo
150021_18_a
Wait...
Wolf
150021_17_a
There're at least a dozen of them.
I'm not sure if we can take them
all at-huh?
Kirito
150021_16_a
Grrr...
Wolf
150021_15_a
Wolves?! How'd they get so close
without us noticing them?!
Eugeo
150021_14_a
Eugeo...!
Get your sword out!
Kirito
150021_13_a
bg_03_forest1
They're supposed to be around
here.
Eugeo
150021_12_a
Let's go check it out.
Kirito
150021_11_a
So it's not monsters or demons
this time, but wolves? Alright,
I'm curious.
Kirito
150021_10_a
Yeah. The fairies living nearby
are scared stiff. Wolves can be
really dangerous.
Eugeo
150021_9_a
Wolves?
Kirito
150021_8_a
A big pack of wolves showed up
in the forest at the edge of the
island.
Eugeo
150021_7_a
No, it's not them...
Eugeo
150021_6_a
What's the problem? Are the
monsters stampeding again?
Kirito
150021_5_a
There's trouble in the Dread
Bastion. Really, it's one thing
after the other with that place.
Eugeo
150021_4_a
Uh oh, I don't like the sound
of that.
Kirito
150021_3_a
Kirito
150021_2_a
bg_event_dungeon_alo
Kirito, bad news!
Eugeo
150021_1_a
Alice
150018_37_a
Absolutely!
Eugeo
150018_36_a
Asuna
150018_35_a
But I'm equally sure this
technique will keep you
both safe.
Kirito
150018_34_a
I'm sure there'll be fights you
can't avoid on your quest to find
the Divine Objects.
Kirito
150018_33_a
Kirito
150018_32_a
Thank you for your kind words,
Alice!
Asuna
150018_31_a
Alice
150018_30_a
I should be thanking you, Alice.
Eugeo
150018_29_a
This technique shall serve us well
in our search for the Divine
Objects.
Alice
150018_28_a
I owe you all my gratitude.
Alice
150018_27_a
Eugeo was right. This will prove
most useful in situations where
one fighter gets overwhelmed.
Alice
150018_26_a
It is quite versatile,
I must confess.
Alice
150018_25_a
Alice
150018_24_a
We've learned your technique!
Thank you both so much!
Eugeo
150018_23_a
Kirito
150018_22_a
Ha ha! Don't let it get you down.
They did it with your help!
Asuna
150018_21_a
But watching them master this
technique so easily makes me
wonder what we were doing wrong.
Kirito
150018_20_a
Yeah. I knew they were powerful
individuals, of course...
Kirito
150018_19_a
Kirito
150018_18_a
Incredible...
They've mastered it already!
Asuna
150018_17_a
Alice
150018_16_a
Eugeo
150018_15_a
Gyaaaggghh!
Monster
150018_14_a
I'm right here!
YAAAAAH!
Eugeo
150018_13_a
Of course!
Keep up!
Alice
150018_12_a
Alice
150018_11_a
We're not done yet! Alice, switch!
Eugeo
150018_10_a
Asuna
150018_9_a
Ooh, they got it!
Kirito
150018_8_a
Alice
150018_7_a
Eugeo
150018_6_a
Glugaaaah!
Monster
150018_5_a
Step back for a moment,
then come back and...HYAAAH!
Alice
150018_4_a
I'm on it! HAAAAHHHHH!
Eugeo
150018_3_a
Eugeo
150018_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Switch, Eugeo!
Alice
150018_1_a
Asuna
150017_35_a
So you're both on board! Great.
Let's start with a little catch.
Kirito
150017_34_a
Eugeo
150017_33_a
If it will help us learn the
technique that much faster, then
I wish to commence immediately.
Alice
150017_32_a
I stand ready! Today's tasks
have given me a sense of
accomplishment.
Alice
150017_31_a
Alice
150017_30_a
I appreciate the enthusiasm,
but you will explain the rules,
right?
Eugeo
150017_29_a
Asuna
150017_28_a
but two beginners might be forced
to work together and see how much
they improve.
Kirito
150017_27_a
You might be onto something.
Seasoned veterans would treat it
like another competition,
Kirito
150017_26_a
Catch is fine, but I think
badminton or table tennis
would work just as well.
Asuna
150017_25_a
Asuna
150017_24_a
Yeah. I've heard sports are a good
way to teach cooperation.
Kirito
150017_23_a
Alice
150017_22_a
I suppose this is yet another
activity that will teach us to
cooperate better?
Eugeo
150017_21_a
Asuna
150017_20_a
You get a small ball and toss it
to one another, just for fun.
Kirito
150017_19_a
Eugeo
150017_18_a
How does one "play catch,"
exactly?
Alice
150017_17_a
Asuna
150017_16_a
Let's play catch in the meantime.
Kirito
150017_15_a
Asuna
150017_14_a
Nah, it'd actually take longer if
we got involved.
Kirito
150017_13_a
Eugeo
150017_12_a
Shouldn't we help her, Kirito?
Alice
150017_11_a
Hehe, is that so? Well, then I
guess I'd better take over and
cook some fish!
Asuna
150017_9_a
Kirito
150017_10_a
Asuna
150017_8_a
And they wouldn't have caught so
many fish without flawless
teamwork.
Kirito
150017_7_a
Alice
150017_6_a
It was truly a team effort. Alice
cornered them, and I brought
them up in a net.
Eugeo
150017_5_a
Eugeo
150017_4_a
We then journeyed upstream and
caught some fish.
Alice
150017_3_a
Kirito
150017_2_a
bg_11_home_lounge
Welcome home, you three!
I see you were out logging.
Asuna
150017_1_a
Wow, we'll be real loggers!
That sounds like fun!
Eugeo
150015_24_a
You two would do fine on your own,
but we'll have everyone pitch in
on this one.
Kirito
150015_23_a
Oh, good point! You helped me with
that recently, didn't you Eugeo?
Then we'll cut down more trees.
Kirito
150015_22_a
Firewood? I don't think there's
much left to pick up...
Eugeo
150015_21_a
Okay, after you're done here, I'll
have you gather some firewood.
Kirito
150015_20_a
Ha ha! Well, we're off to a good
start, then!
Kirito
150015_19_a
I see. Fortunately, if strangely,
I do not despise these tasks...
Alice
150015_18_a
You got it! I find these kinds of
tasks fun, anyway!
Eugeo
150015_17_a
And that cooperation needs to
become second nature if you want
to master this technique.
Kirito
150015_16_a
You bet. You need to learn to
work together in order to fulfill
a common goal.
Kirito
150015_15_a
Will these mundane tasks truly
help us learn that technique?
Alice
150015_14_a
Were it not for the fact that
Eugeo and I also cleaned and
did the washing earlier...
Alice
150015_13_a
Had enough already, Alice?
Kirito
150015_12_a
How much longer must we toil?
Alice
150015_11_a
Oh, nothing. Keep going!
Kirito
150015_10_a
Such as...?
Alice
150015_9_a
Well, there are gardening skills
that make it easier...
Kirito
150015_8_a
V-Very well. I had no idea that
farming involved so much work.
Alice
150015_7_a
Nope, you have to take them out.
Too many rocks impedes absorption
of the soil's nutrients.
Kirito
150015_6_a
It wouldn't be so hard if I could
smash them...
Alice
150015_5_a
Understood. All the rocks make for
difficult digging, I'm afraid.
Alice
150015_4_a
Kirito
150015_3_a
Alice
150015_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake
Alice, could you dig a bit deeper
when you till the soil?
Eugeo
150015_1_a
Asuna
150013_35_a
Yep, you both need to work on
something more fundamental
than sword practice.
Kirito
150013_34_a
Eugeo
150013_33_a
...
Alice
150013_32_a
Kirito
150013_31_a
He's absolutely right about that.
Asuna
150013_30_a
No matter how strong you might be
individually, you won't learn this
technique otherwise.
Kirito
150013_29_a
Asuna
150013_28_a
Ha ha, first things first
if you're
going to learn this technique, even
your breathing has to be in sync.
Kirito
150013_27_a
Alice
150013_26_a
Seriously?
Eugeo
150013_25_a
Even the most convincing of
statements makes me irrationally
angry when it comes from your lips.
Alice
150013_24_a
As I've said, I don't think it
hurts to prepare for the worst.
Eugeo
150013_23_a
I don't object to your desire to
fight alone, but that will only
get you so far.
Eugeo
150013_22_a
B-Be that as it may...!
Alice
150013_21_a
Magic is similar to the Sacred
Arts, but its types are many and
it relies on different faculties.
Eugeo
150013_20_a
There are several forces in this
world that do not exist in ours.
Eugeo
150013_19_a
That's always a possibility...
Eugeo
150013_18_a
Eugeo
150013_17_a
Hmph!
Alice
150013_16_a
Kirito
150013_15_a
Just imagine if an enemy prevented
you from using that technique.
Asuna
150013_14_a
But circumstances on the
battlefield change from
moment to moment.
Asuna
150013_13_a
Kirito
150013_12_a
Not in pure destructive power, no.
Asuna
150013_11_a
You will forgive me for thinking
your technique could not be
any more powerful than this.
Alice
150013_9_a
Eugeo
150013_10_a
Such is the power of an Integrity
Knight in possession of a Divine
Object.
Alice
150013_8_a
Above that is Release
Recollection, a Memory
Release Art.
Alice
150013_7_a
Eugeo
150013_6_a
This is Enhance Armament.
It's a Full Control Art for weapons.
Alice
150013_5_a
Asuna
150013_4_a
Whoa...
Kirito
150013_3_a
Eugeo
150013_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
HYAAAH!
Alice
150013_1_a
Gotcha.
Kirito
150011_30_a
Kirito
150011_29_a
Ha ha! It's been like this for a
while now...
Asuna
150011_28_a
Alice
150011_27_a
Still?!
Eugeo
150011_26_a
I still believe that the power of
the Sacred Arts and Fragrant
Olive's blade will see me through.
Alice
150011_25_a
Eugeo
150011_24_a
I confess I still find myself
resisting this technique at
some level.
Alice
150011_23_a
Asuna
150011_22_a
Yeah, even we struggled with that.
Kirito
150011_21_a
Kirito
150011_20_a
Staying perfectly synchronized
with your partner is no easy feat.
Asuna
150011_19_a
Alice
150011_18_a
sigh
Unfortunately, I'm inclined
to agree with her.
Eugeo
150011_17_a
Eugeo
150011_16_a
At this juncture, I do not believe
there is enough time in the world
to accomplish that feat.
Alice
150011_15_a
Asuna
150011_14_a
Oh, really? Wow, you two will be
unstoppable if you manage to
master it!
Kirito
150011_13_a
Kirito! Good timing. Alice and
Eugeo are trying to learn my
technique.
Asuna
150011_12_a
Hm? What's going on?
Kirito
150011_11_a
Now now, take a deep breath.
Both of you.
Asuna
150011_10_a
Eugeo
150011_9_a
This isn't getting us anywhere...
Alice
150011_8_a
I have been! It's you who need to
fall in line with my movements!
Eugeo
150011_7_a
I most certainly am not!
Observe my movements!
Alice
150011_6_a
I could just as easily say you're
too fast!
Eugeo
150011_5_a
Come now! You're too slow!
Alice
150011_4_a
Whoa!
Eugeo
150011_3_a
Eugeo
150011_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Hyah!
Alice
150011_1_a
Any time! We should come
again when we get the chance.
Kirito
140168_16_a
Thank you, Kirito.
Eugeo
140168_15_a
Even so... It was exciting to see
so many of the living creatures
here.
Eugeo
140168_14_a
Ha ha! Yeah, that aside.
Kirito
140168_13_a
Ha ha. Well, except for that part
with the monsters...
Eugeo
140168_12_a
Anyway, let's head back. We
forgot lunch we were having
so much fun.
Kirito
140168_11_a
...Yeah.
Eugeo
140168_10_a
I'm sure it isn't just all
one-sided, y'know?
Kirito
140168_9_a
And you can tell they care about
each other...just like family.
Kirito
140168_8_a
Maybe you're right... But on the
other hand, I do know some people
with pets.
Kirito
140168_7_a
But at the end of the day,
I'm sure they're happier
living wild and free.
Eugeo
140168_6_a
Like you said before, sea creatures
must make for pretty good pets...
Eugeo
140168_5_a
Hm...? W-Well...
I'd be lying if I said I didn't.
Eugeo
140168_4_a
Eugeo, did you want to take that
hermit crab home as a pet?
Kirito
140168_3_a
Kirito
140168_2_a
bg_event_seashore
...
Eugeo
140168_1_a
Be careful not to get
caught again...
Eugeo
140167_30_a
Yeah... I'll miss you,
little friend.
Eugeo
140167_29_a
Phew... The big one's calmed down.
Kirito
140167_28_a
Grrooooo...
Giant Hermit Crab
140167_27_a
Forgive me...
Eugeo
140167_26_a
Sorry for the trouble. You belong
back with your family.
Eugeo
140167_25_a
I just need to give back
the baby crab I caught!
Eugeo
140167_24_a
Right...
Eugeo
140167_23_a
And I think you know what it is...
Kirito
140167_22_a
Eugeo! There still might be
a way to beat it!
Kirito
140167_21_a
Its Life hasn't gone down at all.
Eugeo
140167_20_a
Gah! I can't make a single
scratch!
Eugeo
140167_19_a
Let me try!
Eugeo
140167_18_a
I-Its shell is too tough!
It's no use.
Kirito
140167_17_a
Take THIS!
Kirito
140167_16_a
GRAAAUGH!!
Giant Hermit Crab
140167_15_a
I think you're onto something!
Kirito
140167_14_a
This is its mom?!
Eugeo
140167_13_a
GRAAAUGH!!!
Giant Hermit Crab
140167_12_a
Does that mean...
Kirito
140167_11_a
Hey, you're right! It's bigger,
but it looks just the same!
Kirito
140167_10_a
It's a hermit crab!
Eugeo
140167_9_a
...Yes! It's the same as
what I caught!
Eugeo
140167_8_a
What is it, Eugeo?! Do you have
some memory about this monster?
Kirito
140167_7_a
I've seen this before...!
Eugeo
140167_6_a
There's another one!
Wait... I think...
Eugeo
140167_5_a
Ugh! Here we go again...
Kirito
140167_4_a
Eugeo
140167_3_a
Kirito
140167_2_a
bg_event_seashore
GRAAAUGH!!!
???
140167_1_a
Yeah. This area must be
outside of the beach's safe
zone.
Kirito
140165_20_a
Maybe that's why this part of
the beach was deserted...
Eugeo
140165_19_a
Yeah! That thing came
out of nowhere.
Kirito
140165_18_a
Alright! We beat him!
Eugeo
140165_17_a
Okay! Got it!
Eugeo
140165_16_a
So watch out!
Kirito
140165_15_a
Right! You take the left side!
And those tentacles are
probably venomous...
Kirito
140165_14_a
Of course!
Eugeo
140165_13_a
Looks like it! And he's not going
down without a fight! Ready,
Eugeo?!
Kirito
140165_12_a
Is that the leader
of the anemones?!
Eugeo
140165_11_a
What the-!
Jeez, right on cue!
Kirito
140165_10_a
GRAAAARRGH!!
???
140165_9_a
I sure am glad we'll never
see a monster like that...
Kirito
140165_8_a
It's sort of cute, but nobody
would stand a chance against
a bigger version.
Eugeo
140165_7_a
The tentacles drifting on the
waves are pretty weird.
Kirito
140165_6_a
Hehe! I guess it does look
like a little sea monster.
Kirito
140165_5_a
It's small, but...there's
something sinister about it.
Eugeo
140165_4_a
Ha ha! That's an anemone.
Kirito
140165_3_a
Kirito
140165_2_a
bg_event_seashore
Waaah!
Eugeo
140165_1_a
...An enemy?
Eugeo
140163_20_a
There should be some more
fish somewhere over here
near this anemone.
Kirito
140163_19_a
Just like the hermit crab
you got there.
Kirito
140163_18_a
Yeah. These days lots of people
keep animals besides cats and
dogs as pets.
Kirito
140163_17_a
But in this world, you also
keep small sea creatures!
How fascinating...
Eugeo
140163_16_a
Some people in my world keep
small birds as pets.
Eugeo
140163_15_a
People just think they're cute and
watch them grow. You know, as
pets.
Kirito
140163_14_a
Um... N-Not quite. We don't have
farms full of hermit crabs...
Kirito
140163_13_a
Raise them...? Like raising
a herd of cattle?
Eugeo
140163_12_a
Ha ha, I don't think so!
Some people raise them
in tanks, though.
Kirito
140163_11_a
I see...
So they wouldn't taste good?
Eugeo
140163_10_a
I've never heard of
eating hermit crabs.
Kirito
140163_9_a
You can eat lobsters,
but to be honest,
Kirito
140163_8_a
That's right. They're both
crustaceans, so they're related.
Kirito
140163_7_a
Hi there, hermit crab...
He looks like a little lobster.
Eugeo
140163_6_a
Alright! You got him!
Wow, it's huge!
Kirito
140163_5_a
And there he goes!
Eugeo
140163_4_a
Right! So I lure him with
this little shrimp...
Kirito
140163_3_a
Kirito
140163_2_a
bg_event_seashore
So, you stand there and...
Eugeo
140163_1_a
What kind of strategy?
Kirito
140161_11_a
Sure, but this time I'm gonna
need you for strategy.
Eugeo
140161_10_a
Yeah! How about you catch
that one to make up for
that fish you lost?
Kirito
140161_9_a
Yeah... Hey! Look at the size
of that hermit crab!
Eugeo
140161_8_a
The more you look, the more
there is to see.
Kirito
140161_7_a
Yeah. There's hermit crabs,
urchins, rock lobsters, gobies...
Kirito
140161_6_a
I could stay and look at these
things for hours!
Eugeo
140161_5_a
Wow... There are so many fish
and so much seaweed here!
Eugeo
140161_4_a
Yeah! They're called tide-pools.
Kirito
140161_3_a
Kirito
140161_2_a
bg_event_seashore
These little lakes in the
rock are amazing!
Eugeo
140161_1_a
Yeah, let's go!
Kirito
140158_26_a
I agree!
Asuna
140158_25_a
Besides, it's not even out yet!
Let's just enjoy ALO while we can,
guys!
Leafa
140158_24_a
Ha ha, so that's how it is.
Kirito
140158_23_a
If it's fun, I'll play it! But I
like ALO too much to just give it
up at the drop of a hat!
Leafa
140158_22_a
We'll see.
She can also get swept up
in new trends pretty easily.
Kirito
140158_21_a
You'll probably keep playing ALO
even after that new AR game
launches.
Asuna
140158_20_a
Hehe, that's Leafa-ever the
optimist!
Asuna
140158_19_a
That's fine by me! In fact, it
just gives me even more motivation
to play!
Leafa
140158_18_a
Fewer players means a better shot
at the top spot, right?
Leafa
140158_17_a
Oh yeah?
Kirito
140158_16_a
Well, I'm here! And I'm super
pumped!
Leafa
140158_15_a
Because there weren't enough
players, huh?
Asuna
140158_14_a
And one of the big PvP tournaments
just got canceled.
Asuna
140158_13_a
So I don't think there will be as
many players as usual.
Kirito
140158_12_a
Everyone seems rather preoccupied
with the new AR game that's
coming out soon.
Kirito
140158_11_a
Really? Why not?
Leafa
140158_10_a
Well, there may not be as many
players as there usually are.
Asuna
140158_9_a
Okay... And...?
Leafa
140158_8_a
Today's quest is a mix of mob
and PvP fighting.
Asuna
140158_7_a
Uh oh... Why?
Leafa
140158_6_a
I wouldn't get too excited if I
were you...
Kirito
140158_5_a
Sugu, um...
Kirito
140158_4_a
Asuna
140158_3_a
Kirito
140158_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Alright!
Let's tackle today's quest!
Leafa
140158_1_a
Yeah, unfortunately...
Kirito
140157_33_a
Which I guess means no more
tournaments in the meantime.
Asuna
140157_32_a
People are probably comparing the
two games right now.
Kirito
140157_31_a
If you say so...
Asuna
140157_30_a
It'll depend on how much fun the
new game is. Those who don't
like OS will come back to ALO.
Kirito
140157_29_a
No, I don't think so.
At least not permanently. There'll
just be a brief dip.
Kirito
140157_28_a
So it's really happening.
ALO is going to start losing
players.
Asuna
140157_27_a
Yeah, I know how that goes.
Kirito
140157_26_a
Gamers have a hard time
controlling expectations when a
new piece of hardware comes out.
Player
140157_25_a
People are leaving ALO behind,
aren't they?
Asuna
140157_24_a
Yeah. It makes sense when I think
about it, and yet...
Kirito
140157_23_a
Which means they're saving up all
that time and money right now.
Player
140157_22_a
As soon as it all goes online,
that's where people will be
spending their time and money.
Player
140157_21_a
No, but they're all players can
talk about lately.
Player
140157_20_a
Yeah, of course.
But they're not online yet,
are they?
Kirito
140157_19_a
Well, AR games are getting all the
attention. You've heard about
them, right?
Player
140157_18_a
What do you mean? What changed?
Kirito
140157_17_a
There was a time I wouldn't have,
and a message like that would've
caused chaos. Now? I dunno.
Player
140157_16_a
Do you really think they couldn't
find enough players?
Kirito
140157_15_a
Yep.
Player
140157_14_a
Yeah. Were you a participant too?
Kirito
140157_13_a
So you got the cancellation notice
too, eh?
Player
140157_12_a
How'd they fall short?
Kirito
140157_11_a
I know! It used to be so popular
that they resorted to a lottery
system to see who got in.
Asuna
140157_10_a
Due to a lack of participants?
Seriously?
Kirito
140157_9_a
The PvP Tournament is...canceled?!
Kirito
140157_8_a
I'll bet it's the same one
I got...
Asuna
140157_7_a
Oh, looks like I just got it too.
Kirito
140157_6_a
What's up? Did you get a message
or something?
Kirito
140157_5_a
I'll bet this time will be no-hm?
Asuna
140157_4_a
Good idea.
That last fight was tough, with
all those other players involved.
Asuna
140157_3_a
Asuna
140157_2_a
bg_18_tower_road
Should we grab something to eat
while we come up with a strategy
for the next quest?
Kirito
140157_1_a
Hmm, taking a wait-and-see
approach, are you? Weird.
Leafa
140155_26_a
I won't know for sure until I try
it, though.
Kirito
140155_25_a
It's definitely cool tech, but I
think I prefer VR.
Kirito
140155_24_a
Like I said, that was a
coincidence. Don't get me wrong,
I'm intrigued.
Kirito
140155_23_a
I mean, you saw the info about it
before anyone else did...
Leafa
140155_22_a
Don't you want to be the first
person to have this, like you were
when the NerveGear came out?
Leafa
140155_21_a
Wait, are you telling me that
you're NOT going to be an early
adopter this time?
Leafa
140155_20_a
I dunno, it's pretty expensive.
Maybe I can convince someone
to give me one...
Kirito
140155_19_a
You're gonna get it, right?
Leafa
140155_18_a
Yeah, I might be able to afford
it with the money I got over
the holidays!
Leafa
140155_17_a
Yeah, that's it. It's actually
pretty cheap, considering all
the features.
Kirito
140155_16_a
The, uhhh...Augma, I think.
Leafa
140155_15_a
Eh, never mind, it wasn't
important. What was the name of
that wearable device again?
Kirito
140155_14_a
Although what?
Leafa
140155_13_a
Yeah, it's pretty wild.
Although...
Kirito
140155_12_a
Who would've thought we'd get
to experience FullDive-levels of
presence in real life?
Leafa
140155_11_a
It's crazy, isn't it? All the
message boards are buzzing about
it!
Leafa
140155_10_a
Ha ha, I didn't beat anyone to
anything. I just happened to
see it.
Kirito
140155_9_a
Wait, the info page admins only
just released this info. How'd you
manage to beat them to the punch?
Leafa
140155_8_a
You did?! That was fast.
Leafa
140155_7_a
Ah, yeah. I saw that too.
Kirito
140155_6_a
They've released more info about
that AR game those players were
just talking about!
Leafa
140155_5_a
I just got a message from Sakuya!
Leafa
140155_4_a
What'd you find? Wait, didn't you
say you were gonna log out?
Kirito
140155_3_a
Kirito
140155_2_a
bg_18_tower_road_sunset
Guys, guys! Look at this!
Leafa
140155_1_a
Ha ha, that we do.
Kirito
140153_34_b
Yeah. Right now we've got a quest
to complete!
Asuna
140153_33_b
We should take a look at it later,
Asuna.
Kirito
140153_32_b
It's up on the info page.
You should have a look!
Player C
140153_31_b
I see. So you weren't talking
about ALO, then.
Kirito
140153_30_b
and we couldn't help but get hyped!
Player B
140153_29_b
That's what we were all watching
just now,
Player B
140153_28_b
The device is called the Augma,
and they just released the first
trailer for the game today.
Player B
140153_27_b
You've probably seen it in the
news by now.
Player B
140153_26_b
And then it overlays graphics on
the real world? Hmm.
Kirito
140153_25_b
It's just a little wearable
device that you put on.
Player A
140153_24_b
Yes, but WAY more advanced, and
the AR device is even smaller
than the AmuSphere.
Player A
140153_23_b
Is it like those games for the
old-school handheld devices that
used your location data?
Asuna
140153_22_a
Wow...
Kirito
140153_21_a
out that's so realistic, people
say it feels like an alternate
dimension!
Player C
140153_20_a
Yup! There have been some
huge advances in AR tech lately,
and there's an AR game coming
Player C
140153_19_a
Oh! Augmented reality, eh?
Kirito
140153_18_a
Nope. We were talking about AR!
Player B
140153_17_a
Hm? Oh, no, we weren't talking
about this quest.
Player A
140153_16_a
Leafa
140153_15_a
You guys look like you're having
a lot of fun! Is this a good
quest or something?
Kirito
140153_14_a
Okay. Maybe they have some tips
for this dungeon.
Asuna
140153_13_a
Seems so. Let's go talk to them.
Kirito
140153_12_a
They're pretty excited about
something over there.
Leafa
140153_11_a
Aw man, why can't it come out
tomorrow!
Player A
140153_10_a
AR's been around forever, but now
it's at the point where you can't
distinguish it from reality!
Player C
140153_9_a
Oh man, it looks insane!
Player B
140153_8_a
It looks great, doesn't it?
Player A
140153_7_a
Hm?
Kirito
140153_6_a
Looks like someone beat us to
the punch.
Leafa
140153_5_a
Kirito, look! Over there.
Asuna
140153_4_a
Leafa
140153_3_a
Asuna
140153_2_a
bg_event_limestone_cave
Okay, this is the dungeon we need
to get through.
Kirito
140153_1_a
Then let's get going!
Asuna
140151_22_a
Yep!
Leafa
140151_21_a
Does that work for you, Sugu?
Kirito
140151_20_a
At your skill levels, I estimate
it will take 1-2 hours.
Yui
140151_19_a
Yeah, that looks good. Yui, any
idea what its difficulty level is?
Kirito
140151_18_a
Then why don't we just do this
short quest today?
Asuna
140151_17_a
Yep, we've got a tournament coming
up soon. And then after
that comes training camp...
Leafa
140151_16_a
Wow, sounds like kendo practice
has gotten pretty intense for you
lately, Leafa.
Asuna
140151_15_a
Yeaaaaah...
Leafa
140151_14_a
Oh, that's right. You've got kendo
practice early in the morning
again, don't you?
Kirito
140151_13_a
I was thinking of logging off
early today, so I won't be able
to help out with that quest.
Leafa
140151_12_a
What's up, Sugu?
Kirito
140151_11_a
Actually... Sorry, I can't.
Leafa
140151_10_a
Sure!
Asuna
140151_9_a
Leafa
140151_8_a
Asuna
140151_7_a
bg_event_butterfly_valley_rainbow
Want to tackle this quest today?
Kirito
140151_6_a
(the player base for which had
been declining, thanks to the
imminent release of OS.)
Kirito
140151_5_a
(Something relatively minor
happened while we were
playing ALO,)
Kirito
140151_4_a
(The hints of which were already
apparent by the time my

biggest challenges yet.)

(Ordinal Scale, a brand new ARMMO,
was a megahit from the second
it launched.)
Kirito
140151_1_a
Alright! I guess we've got each
other's backs from here on out,
Kirito...
Eugeo
140088_41_a
Ha ha, I'm kidding! I can tell
you're speaking from the heart.
I really can...
Eugeo
140088_40_a
Whaa
Kirito
140088_39_a
Talking like that doesn't really
give me the option to turn
you down, huh?
Eugeo
140088_38_a
What do you mean?
Kirito
140088_37_a
Man, you sure are twisting
my arm there!
Eugeo
140088_36_a
...Heh heh!
Eugeo
140088_35_a
I want to be someone that you can
put that much faith in.
Kirito
140088_34_a
So I hope you can think of me
as a friend too.
Kirito
140088_33_a
Kirito...
Eugeo
140088_32_a
Even if it's only been a short time,
I can already tell that we can
trust you and Alice.
Kirito
140088_31_a
But even so...it feels like a miracle
that I was able to meet you, and
I want to think of you as a friend.
Kirito
140088_30_a
...!
Eugeo
140088_29_a
It's about what you said before...
Even if he looks like me, I'm
not the person in your memories.
Kirito
140088_28_a
Huh...?
Eugeo
140088_27_a
But...can you think
of me in this way?
Kirito
140088_26_a
No, I'm the one who should
apologize. I should've been
more considerate.
Kirito
140088_25_a
I'm sorry I made you worry, Kirito.
Eugeo
140088_24_a
Yeah, that sounds like
a good idea to me.
Kirito
140088_23_a
Yeah, I'm fine! But I think I'll hold
off trying to dig up the past
for a little bit.
Eugeo
140088_22_a
And when you tried to remember,
your eye started to hurt...
Are you all right now?
Kirito
140088_21_a
You didn't feel like a stranger to
me. I guess I looked upset because
I was searching for those memories.
Eugeo
140088_20_a
Eugeo...
Kirito
140088_19_a
No, not you. Someone like you...
I...have a memory of that person.
Eugeo
140088_18_a
That's because...somewhere deep
inside of me, you
Eugeo
140088_17_a
Uh, yeah...
Kirito
140088_16_a
I heard you were asking about
why I was acting strange earlier.
Eugeo
140088_15_a
Kirito...
Eugeo
140088_14_a
The only thing that matters
is that I like you.
Kirito
140088_13_a
...!
Eugeo
140088_12_a
Or how long I've known you...
At least, that's how I feel.
Kirito
140088_11_a
That might be how most people
think. But to me, friendship isn't
about where you came from...
Kirito
140088_10_a
How can you call someone a friend
when you've only just met them
and don't even know their identity?
Eugeo
140088_9_a
Huh...? Well, that's because...
Because you're my friend, Eugeo!
Kirito
140088_8_a
Why did you risk
your life to save me?
Eugeo
140088_7_a
...Kirito.
Eugeo
140088_6_a
You can't fly, huh, Eugeo?
That must make this world
pretty inconvenient for you...
Kirito
140088_5_a
D-Don't worry about it! They
weren't that strong, but they're
good at long-range attacks.
Kirito
140088_4_a

Eugeo

But I won't lose!

Grrrawr!

HYAAAAAAH!

bg_event_alo_sky
Hah!
Kirito
140087_13_a
Eugeo
140087_12_a
I'm left with no choice.
I'll have to do it alone!
Kirito
140087_11_a
Grraaaaaahhh!
Grraaaghk!!
Monster
140087_10_a
Eugeo!!
Kirito
140087_9_a
Gaaaah!!
Eugeo
140087_8_a
Crap! With that long-range aerial
attack pattern, Eugeo's at a
real disadvantage here!
Kirito
140087_7_a
And it's the flying-type that
fires magic from its mouth...
Kirito
140087_6_a
Dammit! Of all the times
for a monster to show up!
Kirito
140087_5_a
Wha

GRAAWRGH!!
Monster
140087_1_a
Eugeo?!
Kirito
140085_20_a
My eye... My right eye...
It's burning!!
Eugeo
140085_19_a
H-Hey! Are you all right?
Kirito
140085_18_a
Nghh... Aaagh!
Eugeo
140085_17_a
Huh?
Eugeo?!
Kirito
140085_16_a
Nnngh!
Eugeo
140085_15_a
...!
Eugeo
140085_14_a
That must be why. Because they're
very important to you.
Kirito
140085_13_a
Well, think about it. That's the
only memory you have left,
right?
Kirito
140085_12_a
What...?
Eugeo
140085_11_a
So that must've been someone
you really cared about, huh?
Kirito
140085_10_a
And then I knew I had to protect
them no matter what... I remember
thinking that.
Eugeo
140085_9_a
But then, someone kind took
me by the hand and held
me close.
Eugeo
140085_8_a
But...I know that before I lost
my memory, something horrible
happened to me.
Eugeo
140085_7_a
Not really. Her point of view
makes sense. After all, I don't know
much about myself either.
Eugeo
140085_6_a
She's pretty cold, isn't she...?
Kirito
140085_5_a
Even so...Alice said that
about me, huh...?
Eugeo
140085_4_a
N-No, that's not it... I just
wasn't sure if you wanted to
talk to me or not.
Kirito
140085_3_a
Kirito
140085_2_a
bg_18_mountain
Ha ha! You worry too much
about me... Thank you, Kirito.
Eugeo
140085_1_a
Maybe I should...
Kirito
140083_22_a
If you want him to open his
heart to you, why not ask
him yourself?
Alice
140083_21_a
What?! Is that true?
Kirito
140083_20_a
He told me that he may have
met you before in the past.
Alice
140083_19_a
I see...
Kirito
140083_18_a
I'm simply stating the facts.
And that is why I don't think I
can give you a satisfying answer.
Alice
140083_17_a
Th-That's a bit harsh...
Kirito
140083_16_a
Correct. It's even possible that
in his state of amnesia, he's simply
spouting meaningless nonsense.
Alice
140083_15_a
You mentioned that there's no
Integrity Knight you know named
Eugeo, right?
Kirito
140083_14_a
It just doesn't make sense...
There simply is no such person
as Synthesis Thirty-Two.
Alice
140083_13_a
What do you mean?
Kirito
140083_12_a
I can see his skills are on par with
an Integrity Knight's, but he's a
mystery. If anything, it's suspicious.
Alice
140083_11_a
I don't know the man well.
Alice
140083_10_a
...
Alice
140083_9_a
Even though he looked really
happy up until then...
I wonder what happened...
Kirito
140083_8_a
Right at the end, his expression
went dark... He really wears his
heart on his sleeve, huh?
Kirito
140083_7_a
He didn't seem to be thinking over
the details as much as you,
Alice, but...
Kirito
140083_6_a
I was just explaining the rules
of this world. He seemed to be
taking it in quite easily, too.
Kirito
140083_5_a
What's going on?
Alice
140083_4_a
Uh, yeah...
Kirito
140083_3_a
Kirito
140083_2_a
bg_event_alne_field
Is Eugeo unwell?
Alice
140083_1_a
Eugeo...?
Kirito
140081_29_a
Oh, it's...
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Eugeo
140081_28_a
Hm? What's wrong?
Kirito
140081_27_a
...!
Eugeo
140081_26_a
Of course!
Kirito
140081_25_a
Yeah. That's why I'm counting
on your help, Kirito.
Eugeo
140081_24_a
You mean gathering the Divine
Objects for Urdr, right?
Kirito
140081_23_a
Anyway...the sooner we finish
our task here, the sooner we
can get back to our world.
Eugeo
140081_22_a
Ha ha! I guess so. I'm more
adaptable than most, though.
Kirito
140081_21_a
So when I put it that way, can
you get your head around it?
Eugeo
140081_20_a
...!
Kirito
140081_19_a
Even if I met you there and you
understood everything I told you,
it might not be enough, right?
Eugeo
140081_18_a
Oh... Yeah, I guess.
Kirito
140081_17_a
Imagine if you suddenly wandered
into our world, Kirito. You'd be
pretty flustered, don't you think?
Eugeo
140081_16_a
You think so?
Kirito
140081_15_a
And besides, you'd probably feel
the same way if you were in
our shoes.
Eugeo
140081_14_a
I think that's just her
no-nonsense personality.
Eugeo
140081_13_a
N-No, it's just that when I
explained this to Alice, she
seemed really agitated...
Kirito
140081_12_a
Oh? Is that strange?
Eugeo
140081_11_a
Wow, you got your head
around that quickly!
Kirito
140081_10_a
I think I understand.
Eugeo
140081_9_a
To them, that makes you...
unusual.
Kirito
140081_8_a
You're from a different world than
us, and our world's rules might
not apply to you.
Kirito
140081_7_a
All the people who gather around
you and Alice are curious
because...
Kirito
140081_6_a
Yeah, that's that.
We live according to those rules.
Kirito
140081_5_a
So this world has a number
of different Taboo Indexes.
Eugeo
140081_4_a
...and that's how it is.

キリト

へぇ……そうなんですね……

サラマンダーって乱暴な人が
多いイメージがあったから、
ちょっと意外でした
プレイヤー

その人サラマンダーだったんです
けど、すごく親切で……

Don't try to just laugh this off!
Asuna
140038_26_a
Hahaha...
Kirito
140038_25_a
Of course you did! Your reaction
earlier was totally different!
Asuna
140038_24_a
N-No, I didn't mean it that way!
Kirito
140038_23_a
What?! So it's not good enough
when I tell you?!
Asuna
140038_22_a
Did he? That means a lot, coming
from someone like him.
Kirito
140038_21_a
He said you were a very
skilled swordsman.
Asuna
140038_20_a
Huh? Really? But we've only
ever really spoken during battles
against floor bosses...
Kirito
140038_19_a
Oh, speaking of our great
commander, he seems to have
taken a liking to you, Kirito.
Asuna
140038_18_a
I suppose...
Asuna
140038_17_a
you're pretty safe. You don't
have to worry about getting
killed so much.
Kirito
140038_16_a
With such a great commander and
so many strong players around,
Kirito
140038_15_a
I think you made the right call
joining the Knights of the Blood
Oath, Asuna.
Kirito
140038_14_a
O-Okay... Sorry...
But, you know,
Kirito
140038_13_a
So don't say things like that,
okay?
Asuna
140038_12_a
Asuna...
Kirito
140038_11_a
You're wrong, Kirito.
You're amazing in your own right!
Asuna
140038_10_a
it's easy to see...
That man is everything I'm not.
Kirito
140038_9_a
and taking into account how
he's always level-headed and
charismatic even...
Kirito
140038_8_a
Not just that... Looking at his
actions in battle from a technical
perspective,
Kirito
140038_7_a
It is. Divine Blade, his unique
skill, is...truly amazing.
Asuna
140038_6_a
Whoa... That's incredible.
Kirito
140038_5_a
They say he felled it
in a single stroke.
Asuna
140038_4_a
Yeah... According to the ones who
accompanied him, he didn't have
hardly any trouble.
Asuna
140038_3_a
Asuna
140038_2_a
bg_02_fountain
So he was able to defeat that
monster after all?
Kirito
140038_1_a
Hahaha, have faith, and await
my return. You are in charge
while I'm away.
Heathcliff
140037_23_a
I understand, Commander...
Asuna
140037_22_a
Judging your limits only by the
gauges you can see will result
in egregious mistakes, Asuna.
Heathcliff
140037_21_a
It's not that.
Your spirit needs rest too.
Heathcliff
140037_20_a
My HP is already fully recovered!
Asuna
140037_19_a
No, you should rest. I'll bring
other guild members with me
for this round.
Heathcliff
140037_18_a
Then I'll come with you!
I'll do better this time!
Asuna
140037_17_a
They are not interested in
anything other than clearing
the floors.
Heathcliff
140037_16_a
Would it not be better to enlist
the aid of the Assault Team?
Asuna
140037_15_a
B-But...the monster is truly
overwhelming.
Asuna
140037_14_a
It absolutely is not.
Heathcliff
140037_13_a
Th-This is all my fault...
Asuna
140037_12_a
I must defeat it before rumors
spread that there is a monster
even the Knights cannot best.
Heathcliff
140037_11_a
I am.
Heathcliff
140037_10_a
You're going yourself to defeat
the monster, Commander?!
Asuna
140037_9_a
This time, I will go myself.
Heathcliff
140037_8_a
S-Sir...
Asuna
140037_7_a
You commanded your troops
perfectly. Thank you.
Heathcliff
140037_6_a
I am more relieved that you
returned without any casualties.
Heathcliff
140037_5_a
Not at all. That boss was much
stronger than we could have
ever imagined.
Heathcliff
140037_4_a
Commander, I am sorry...
I failed my mission...
Asuna
140037_3_a
Asuna
140037_2_a
bg_09_kob_office
I see...
Heathcliff
140037_1_a
U-Understood!
Knight of the Blood Oath
140035_21_a
All units, withdraw!
Asuna
140035_20_a
I know... I was hoping to avoid
that, but I guess we have no
choice.
Asuna
140035_19_a
You can't keep fighting like this.
You have to retreat.
Kirito
140035_18_a
Th-Thank you...
Asuna
140035_17_a
I'm glad I made it in time.
Kirito
140035_16_a
I knew as soon as I heard that
a Knights' raid party was here
that it would be you, Asuna.
Kirito
140035_15_a
K-Kirito!
Asuna
140035_14_a
Tch!
Kirito
140035_13_a
Aaaaaaaahhh!
Asuna
140035_12_a
Wha-?
Asuna
140035_11_a
Vice Commander Asuna!
W-Watch out!
Knight of the Blood Oath
140035_10_a
GRRAAAAAAAH!!
Monster
140035_9_a
Ha ha, I don't know why I'm
thinking about that right now.
Asuna
140035_8_a
And that the developer intended
people to come back and try again
after they'd leveled some more...
Asuna
140035_7_a
that people are saying the event
bosses outside of the main story
are tougher than floor bosses...
Asuna
140035_6_a
Kirito did mention...
Asuna
140035_5_a
This thing is strong... Maybe
even stronger than some of
the floor bosses we've fought.
Asuna
140035_4_a
GRRRAAAAAGH!!
Monster
140035_3_a
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Knight of the Blood Oath
140035_2_a
bg_03_dungeon
Attackers, hang back!
Heal yourselves!
Asuna
140035_1_a
Hehehe...
Heathcliff
140033_19_a
H-He did not! Why would you
say such a thing, Commander?!
Asuna
140033_18_a
By chance, did the Black Swordsman
cross your mind just now?
Heathcliff
140033_17_a
Th-That's generous of you.
Asuna
140033_16_a
I see. Well, it's up to you.
I will also reward any non-
members whose help you require.
Heathcliff
140033_15_a
I...won't be bringing him along.
He seems intent on holding me
back for some reason.
Asuna
140033_14_a
You're free to choose who comes
with you. Kuradeel has expressed
his interest.
Heathcliff
140033_13_a
Yes, Commander.
Asuna
140033_12_a
Indeed. That boss is quite
formidable. If it starts looking
too dangerous, retreat at once.
Heathcliff
140033_11_a
But they could be killed...
Asuna
140033_10_a
If some treasure hunter could get
their hands on it, it would make
quite the story.
Heathcliff
140033_9_a
An extremely rare piece of
equipment is said to slumber
within the dungeon's depths.
Heathcliff
140033_8_a
Well, part of me understands why
those players are taking such
risks.
Heathcliff
140033_7_a
Since it isn't a floor boss, there
is an endless stream of players
attempting to fight it...
Asuna
140033_6_a
I don't mind. You're very busy,
after all. And this situation is...
troubling.
Asuna
140033_5_a
all I ever do is assign you
glorified chores.
Heathcliff
140033_4_a
Sorry, Asuna. Even though you're
my vice commander,
Heathcliff
140033_3_a
Heathcliff
140033_2_a
bg_09_kob_office
Understood. So I just have to
take down that dungeon's boss.
Asuna
140033_1_a
N-No, we are not!
Asuna
140031_23_a
Hahaha, are you not?
Heathcliff
140031_22_a
Please don't assume that Kirito
and I are in constant contact!
Asuna
140031_21_a
...Commander!
Asuna
140031_20_a
I will...
Asuna
140031_19_a
I see. That's unfortunate.
If he ever changes his mind,
be sure to bring up the offer.
Heathcliff
140031_18_a
It's doubtful that a dedicated
solo player like Kirito would
ever consent to joining a guild.
Asuna
140031_17_a
Well... I don't believe that
would work.
Asuna
140031_16_a
If possible, I would like to
recruit him into the guild. What
do you think of that, Asuna?
Heathcliff
140031_15_a
I believe I am coming to grasp
his personality a bit better. And
his skills speak for themselves.
Heathcliff
140031_14_a
Hahaha, I don't mind. He is always
there when we need him to
fight the floor bosses.
Heathcliff
140031_13_a
I apologize, Commander. He is
skilled with the sword, but lacks
social grace, I'm afraid...
Asuna
140031_12_a
H-He left...
Asuna
140031_11_a
K-Kirito! You should be more
respectful towards the commander!
Asuna
140031_9_a
Kirito
140031_10_a
Thanks...
Kirito
140031_8_a
I must commend you as well,
Black Swordsman. Your attacks
were superb.
Heathcliff
140031_7_a
...
Kirito
140031_6_a
Yes, sir.
Asuna
140031_5_a
You too, Asuna. Once it's been
activated, let's return to
Grandzam.
Heathcliff
140031_4_a
Good work, Commander.
Asuna
140031_3_a
Asuna
140031_2_a
bg_13_boss
We defeated the floor boss...
Now this floor is open to travel.
Heathcliff
140031_1_a
S-Sure...
Kirito
140018_23_a
At any rate, thanks.
I'm glad you told me.
Klein
140018_22_a
K-Klein...
Kirito
140018_21_a
I'm never going to NOT worry about
you as long as you insist on
isolating yourself...
Klein
140018_20_a
Don't think I'm fine
distancing myself like you are.
Klein
140018_19_a
K-dawg, man...
It's easy for you to say that.
Klein
140018_18_a
So...I'd appreciate it if you'd
think of this as some sort of
weird fluke.
Kirito
140018_17_a
I don't think I could work with
you guys even if I wanted to.
Kirito
140018_16_a
Klein... I AM a solo player...
Kirito
140018_15_a
Geez, I thought you had more
social skills than that!
Klein
140018_14_a
W-Well...
Kirito
140018_13_a
Who would be annoyed
by something like that?!
Klein
140018_12_a
I-I didn't want to say anything
to annoy you guys...
Kirito
140018_11_a
You WERE worried about us, right?
Klein
140018_10_a
Seriously, you should LEAD with
that!
Klein
140018_9_a
What the heck, Kirito! Don't keep
that kind of stuff to yourself! Why
didn't you just SAY something?
Klein
140018_8_a
I did.
Kirito
140018_7_a
about our low-level guild members?
Klein
140018_6_a
So you knew from the start
Klein
140018_5_a
Y-Yeah... Is that wrong?
Kirito
140018_4_a
You were just trying to help us?
Is that what you're saying?
Klein
140018_3_a
Kirito
140018_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Watch over us...? You mean...
You mean we're being targeted.
Klein
140018_1_a
Huh...?
Klein
140017_22_a
So I just wanted to watch over you
and the others from a safe
distance.
Kirito
140017_21_a
There are other rumors...
Ones that say Laughing Coffin is
after members of new guilds.
Kirito
140017_20_a
Then I saw you and Furinkazan.
Kirito
140017_19_a
Hm? So that's it?
You should've just told me!
Klein
140017_18_a
I was helping them investigate
rumors that said Laughing Coffin
was here.
Kirito
140017_17_a
I came here to help out the
Knights of the Blood Oath.
Kirito
140017_16_a
The truth is...
Kirito
140017_15_a
...
Kirito
140017_14_a
Tell me what you're hiding.
Klein
140017_13_a
K-Klein...
Kirito
140017_12_a
I know I said you looked better,
but I still couldn't help thinking
you were acting really weird!
Klein
140017_11_a
Because you were worrying me!
Klein
140017_10_a
B-But why...?
Kirito
140017_9_a
Everyone DID leave.
I'm the only one who stayed.
Klein
140017_8_a
You first! I thought you said
Furinkazan was leaving!
Kirito
140017_7_a
What the heck are you still
doing here?
Klein
140017_6_a
Huh?!
Wha-!
Klein!
Kirito
140017_5_a
Oh ho, Laughing Coffin, huh?
Klein
140017_4_a
I guess I'll head back too...
Kirito
140017_3_a
Turns out the rumors of
Laughing Coffin being on this
floor are just that-rumors.
Kirito
140017_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Hmm...
Kirito
140017_1_a
Be careful, Asuna.
See you later.
Kirito
140015_27_a
Well, the Knights of the Blood
Oath are about ready to head back.
Thanks for the help!
Asuna
140015_26_a
Yeah...
Kirito
140015_25_a
It worked out without him knowing
after all.
Asuna
140015_24_a
Hmm, I see.
Well, then there shouldn't be
anything to worry about.
Asuna
140015_23_a
He already knew. And he said
he's leaving this floor.
Kirito
140015_22_a
Don't you think you should
have warned him because
of the danger?
Asuna
140015_21_a
Well, one of the reasons
I came to this floor
was to investigate that.
Asuna
140015_20_a
Because they're supposedly
targeting new guilds, right?
Asuna
140015_19_a
I got kind of worried...
Kirito
140015_18_a
so when I heard that Laughing
Coffin was getting active again,
Kirito
140015_17_a
It's just his guild is brand new,
Kirito
140015_16_a
Don't make fun of me...
Kirito
140015_15_a
Well, you're friends, right?
So tell him. Or do boys not need
to talk to communicate?
Asuna
140015_14_a
Even you get embarrassed
around some people, huh?
Asuna
140015_13_a
Wh-What?
Kirito
140015_12_a
Hehehe.
Asuna
140015_11_a
Huh-?
Asuna
140015_10_a
Because...it's embarrassing.
Kirito
140015_9_a
What? Why not?
Asuna
140015_8_a
No way. I don't want him knowing.
Kirito
140015_7_a
They're obviously worried and
just trying to look out for you.
Asuna
140015_6_a
Huh?
Why don't you just tell them?
Asuna
140015_5_a
It's nothing...
Just someone I know trying
to figure out what I'm up to.
Kirito
140015_4_a
Something the matter, Kirito?
You've been running all over
the place...
Asuna
140015_3_a
Asuna
140015_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Phew...
Kirito
140015_1_a
What?!
You think you can run from me?!
Get back here, Kirito!
Klein
140013_25_a
C-Catch you later, Klein!
Kirito
140013_24_a
Don't play dumb. It's not nothing!
It's gotta be something!
Klein
140013_23_a
N-Nothing.
It's nothing...
Kirito
140013_22_a
What are you hiding, Kirito?
Klein
140013_21_a
But judging from that reaction,
I guess that's not it.
Klein
140013_20_a
I thought maybe you were
meeting up with your lady
on this floor or something...
Klein
140013_19_a
Huh?!
Kirito
140013_18_a
Listen, if you've hooked up,
it means you have a girlfriend.
Or, you know, a lover.
Klein
140013_17_a
Hmm...
In any case, it looks like
I might have guessed wrong...
Klein
140013_16_a
What are you talking about?
Kirito
140013_15_a
Maybe this conversation needs
to wait until you're a bit older.
Klein
140013_14_a
Hooked up...?
What's that supposed to mean?
Kirito
140013_13_a
Don't tell me...
You hooked up with a lady!
Klein
140013_12_a
Wh-What?
Kirito
140013_11_a
Wait...!
Klein
140013_10_a
Hey... Did you hear me?
I didn't stutter or mumble
or anything, right?
Klein
140013_9_a
Yeah. Sure.
Kirito
140013_8_a
Me and the Furinkazan guys
are gonna get out of here.
You should be careful too.
Klein
140013_7_a
Th-They are?
Kirito
140013_6_a
Oh, that reminds me. I heard
some Laughing Coffin guys
are lurking around this area.
Klein
140013_5_a
Y-Yeah.
Kirito
140013_4_a
You're still here, huh?
Klein
140013_3_a
H-Hey, Klein.
Kirito
140013_2_a
bg_11_forest_yui
Hey, Kirito.
Klein
140013_1_a
O-Oh...

Some of them are still pretty low
level, so I thought it'd be
perfect to hunt mobs around here.
Klein
140011_25_a
I was just getting together with
some guild members to
gather materials.
Klein
140011_24_a
This floor was cleared a long time
ago, so it's not like there's
anything left to do here.
Kirito
140011_23_a
Th-That's rich coming from you!
What are YOU doing here?
Kirito
140011_22_a
You're acting really weird, man.
Klein
140011_21_a
Hm?
W-Well...
You know...
Kirito
140011_20_a
Let's just pretend I don't know.
What are you up to?
Klein

Klein

Kirito

Uh-huh...
Klein

Oh, you know.
Kirito
140011_15_a
So, what're you doing here,
anyway?
Klein
140011_14_a
Yeah. Thanks.
Kirito
140011_13_a
But I guess if you're making dumb
jokes like that, it means you're
all healed up.
Klein

You're hopeless.
Klein
140011_11_a
Hahaha, sorry.
Kirito

Not even close! Furinkazan, man!
You said it wrong on purpose
now, didn't you!
Klein
140011_9_a
What was it called again?
Fooly-cousin or something?
Kirito
140011_8_a
I've actually been hearing a lot
about you lately, Klein. Seems
your guild's been flourishing.
Kirito
140011_7_a
Don't worry about it, man.
Klein
140011_6_a
Uh, yeah.
Sorry for worrying you back then.
Kirito
140011_5_a
Still rocking the dark-and-
mysterious vibe, I see! Still,
you look...brighter than before.
Klein
140011_4_a
You're right about that.

Agil
134679_2_a
They've even put up a teaser site
for it. I'm gonna take a look.
Kazuto
134679_3_a
Looks like a Japanese game company
I've never heard of. They've
released a bunch of games, though.
Kazuto
134679_4_a
Does it say who made it?
Agil
134679_5_a
Heh, yeah. But I wasn't sure
anyone would actually go through
with it.
Kazuto

Rumor: April Fools' Day Special
VRMMO Goes Live Tomorrow.
Kazuto
134679_9_a
One of the VRMMO sites I follow
just posted a new article.
Kazuto
134679_10_a
What's up?
Agil
134679_11_a
Hm?
Kazuto
134679_12_a
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
Agil
134679_13_a
And I'm sure there'll be at least
one special event in The Seed
Nexus VRMMOs.
Kazuto
134679_14_a
But it's gotten really crazy these
last few years. Even businesses
are getting in on the action.
Agil
134679_15_a
Websites just used to put up
little gag articles and stuff when
I was a kid.
Agil
134679_16_a
Ah yeah, good point.
Agil
134679_17_a
Games have been putting little
gags in on April Fools' Day for
a while now.
Kazuto
134679_18_a
Tomorrow is April Fools' Day.
Kazuto
134679_19_a
What do you mean, "pull on us"?
Agil
134679_20_a
Wow, you're right. I wonder what
the devs will try to pull on us
this time...
Kazuto
134679_21_a
Yep. Tomorrow's April already.
Agil
134679_22_a
Spring is definitely on its way.
I'm covered in sweat just from the
bike ride here.
Kazuto
134679_23_a
Oh, actually, make that an iced
coffee. Sorry, I just realized
how warm it is.
Kazuto

You got it.

So I keep fighting with my

me kick this phobia.
Shino

I figure the stronger Sinon gets,
the stronger I'll get in the real

Shino
33006_20_a
still_s2_03_0090
And in a way, it did. As Sinon,
when I'm holding a gun or facing
one, I can handle it.
Shino
33006_19_a
One day, Shinkawa told me about
GGO. I thought it could work as a
kind of therapy for me.
Shino
33006_18_a
I came to Tokyo for high school,
thinking if I got far enough from
home, it'd help. But it didn't.
Shino
33006_17_a
Ever since that day, whenever I
see a gun, I freak out. Even just
a picture gives me a panic attack.

It's nice to see you again.

What's going on, Kirigaya?
Aki
33006_4_a

But there's still that 1% chance
it could be true. That's why I'm
here.
Kazuto

You can't kill someone in the real
world from the virtual anymore.
I know that's impossible.
Kazuto

still_s2_03_0063
I'm 99% sure the Death Gun story's
a hoax. Probably someone trolling.
Kazuto

I'll just dive into Gun Gale

what's going on, and that's that.
Kirito

Don't worry. I'll be back in ALO

Just get back as soon as you can.
This is our home, and it's not the
same without you.

I guess if Mr. Kikuoka is asking
you to, you can't say no.

Oh... Hmm... Hey, how are your

Shino

Nah. No point.
I'll just die.
Kyouji

Don't get so down about that
stuff. Sign up for BoB and see
what happens!
Shino
33002_14_a
Ugh, whatever. An AGI build only
gets you so far. A good gun helps
too, but I spent my points wrong.
Kyouji
33002_13_a
That is so not true! In the last
qualifier, you made it all the way
to the semi-finals, remember?
Shino
33002_12_a
Man... Asada, you're amazing.
I'm the one who got you into GGO,
but I've been totally left behind.
Kyouji

(If I can take out all my enemies
and prove I'm the strongest,
I'll be free.)
Shino
33002_10_a
...I-I mean, crack the higher
ranks.
Shino
33002_9_a
I'm definitely entering. I've got
my Hecate now. With her in my

Shino

Man, wish I had problems like
that... So, what are your plans
for the next BoB?
Kyouji

Don't forget some people think my
Hecate's a cheat too. It does have
its own special problems, though.
Shino

Ugh. Miniguns should be banned.
Kyouji

You were rad, though! That Behemoth
guy was kinda a legend 'cause he
never bought it in a squad fight.
Kyouji

It's better if we logged out. At

Right, but their blasters can't
fire as fast as a live ammo gun.

'em, our shields aren't enough!

he'll panic and burn through it.

Well, we can't keep sitting here,

Alright, we're gonna stick with
the original plan and wait for 'em
in the shadow of that building.
Dyne

Hate to interrupt you guys,
but they're closing on us.
They're at 2,500 meters.
Player
32002_41_a
Understood. I'll drop the guy with
the Minimi first, but my second
bullet has Mr. Cloak's name on it.
Sinon
32002_40_a
If he starts lighting us up and
those blasters move in, it's
gonna get ugly.
Dyne
32002_39_a
I hear what you're saying, but
there's also a Minimi out there,
and that's a problem.
Dyne
32002_38_a
Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.
He's an unknown, so he's a risk.
Sinon
32002_37_a
No way. He's not carrying any
weapons.
Dyne
32002_36_a
I'm getting a bad vibe from the
guy in back. I think we should
take him out before anyone else.
Sinon
32002_35_a
Looks like he's a STR-build. I bet
he's just carrying the squad's
drops. Eh, we can ignore him.
Dyne
32002_34_a
Hah, no way. What, you believe
in fairy tales now?
Dyne
32002_33_a
still_s2_02_0025
He's wearing a cloak? Maybe
it's him: that Death Gun guy
everyone's talking about.
Ginrou
32002_32_a

The new guy in the back's got a
cloak on. Can't see what he's
carrying.
Dyne

still_s2_02_0024
Annnd...a guy with a Minimi.
He goes down first.
Dyne
32002_30_a
still_s2_01_0072
We got four optical blasters in
the front. I see one large caliber
laser rifle. Not a problem.
Dyne
32002_29_a
Yup, it's them. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...
That's one more than last week.
Dyne

About time they showed up to the
party.

We've got all our bases covered.
Right, Sinon?
Dyne

Sinon
32002_21_a
And besides, we've got the best
sniper in GGO watching our backs.
Dyne
32002_20_a
By now, they might have one
firearm for support, but that's
about it.
Dyne
32002_19_a
We hit 'em not too long ago.
I doubt they got their hands on
enough live-ammo guns that fast.
Dyne
32002_18_a
Well, what if they got smart?
Like, what if they're ready for
us this time?
Ginrou
32002_17_a
But we've got defense shields,
so as long as those are up, it's
easy pickings.
Dyne
32002_16_a
As for weapons, they're geared up
with optical guns for hunting
monsters.
Dyne
32002_15_a
(If we're ever on opposite sides
of a fight, I'm taking him down
with a headshot...)
Sinon
32002_14_a

the same party again and again.
Doesn't he have any pride?)
Sinon
32002_13_a
Heh. Damn straight.
Player
32002_12_a
They move by algorithm, just like
the monsters. As far as I'm
concerned, they're chumps.
Dyne
32002_11_a
cause they make it up on the next
hunt. For player-hunter squads
like us, they're perfect targets.
Dyne
32002_10_a
All that squad does is hunt
monsters. They don't care how
many times they get attacked,
Dyne
32002_9_a
They could've wised up to us and
changed their route.
Ginrou
32002_8_a
Dude, no one's complaining.
But still, aren't these the same
jokers we hit last week?
Ginrou
32002_7_a
That means your cut'll be bigger
this time, so no complaining.
Dyne
32002_6_a
So relaaax. I bet they're busy
clearing some big-ass monster
spawn.
Dyne
32002_5_a
They're coming, alright.

just one more time?
I don't think we have enough time...
Kirito

Yes, but your skills and XP are
really high. Maybe you can smash
through with a burst of speed.
Yui
23004_14_a
So what you're saying is they all
add up to one unbeatable boss,
huh?
Kirito

As I see it, this quest was
designed to be next to impossible
to finish.
Yui

The stats for one aren't very
high, but that's not the problem.
There's just too many of them.

I guess that's why I still haven't
figured out how I fit in at home

And I can't come back until she
wakes up. In a way, the game

All you can do is accept them as
is. In the end, they are whoever

different. It's a waste of time

something.

You pushed me away 'cause I'm not
your real sister, didn't you? So
why do you care about me now?!
Suguha

It's because you knew the whole
time, didn't you?!
Suguha

That's why you quit kendo, isn't
it? And why you started avoiding
me?

But they could only make it up to
the lowest branches before
bailing.

I heard about some players who got
more than halfway by
piggybacking on each other.
Kirito

And if you just fly straight up,
the flight limit of your wings'd
expire before you got halfway.

They made the whole trunk off-
limits, so a player can't even
get close enough to try.

up the raiding party and stuff.

But why are you in such a hurry

Well, I can't see why not. In fact
the truth is, we'd be grateful
to have you along.

Or maybe you want to take away my
command? Your rule won't last long

I'm sure Mortimer made him an
offer: my head in return for
reincarnation as a Salamander.
Sakuya
20009_11_a
It must have to do with the new

adding a reincarnation system.
Sakuya

Yeah but even so, why would he
turn spy for the Salamanders?
Leafa

And not just for his abilities and
character stats, but also as a
player. He craves power.
Sakuya

Power is very important
to a man like Sigurd...
Sakuya

in terms of power, we'd fallen
behind the Salamanders.

But I won't go down that easy!

you have to survive until I do.

Oh no, he's the strongest player?
Leafa
20005_13_a
still_20_eugene2
Mortimer's a brilliant strategist,
but in terms of sheer power Eugene
is this game's strongest player.
Sakuya
20005_12_a
still_20_eugene2
He's the younger brother of the
Salamander leader, Mortimer. They
are brothers in real life, too.
Sakuya
20005_11_a
Y-Yeah, I know the name...
Leafa
20005_10_a
Have you heard of him?
Sakuya
20005_9_a
Yes, and there's only one person
I know who can use it:
General Eugene.
Sakuya

You need a two-handed sword
skill of 950 to equip it.

sword? It's the Demon Sword
Gram.

Sakuya

If you can survive my attacks for
thirty seconds, then I'll believe
you are who you say you are.
Eugene
20004_27_a
You're all alone, and you've got
crappy gear, so there's no way
you can be anyone's ambassador.
Eugene
20004_26_a
...
Eugene
20004_25_a
All of our races are gonna team
up, and we'll bring the fight
straight to the Salamanders.
Kirito
20004_24_a
but if you interrupt our talks,
you're gonna get to feel some
serious hurt.
Kirito
20004_23_a
Yeah, that's right. I was sent here
to negotiate trade terms with
the Sylphs and the Cait Siths,
Kirito
20004_22_a
And you're supposed to be their
ambassador, but you've come
here without a guard?
Eugene
20004_21_a
The Undines are allied with the
Spriggans, huh?
Eugene
20004_20_a
Since you're on the offensive
today, I'm assuming you wanna wage
a full-on war between the races.
Kirito
20004_19_a
My name is Kirito. I'm an
ambassador for the Spriggan-Undine
alliance.
Kirito
20004_18_a
I'll kill you however you answer,
but in honor of your bravery,
I'll hear you out.
Eugene

What the hell is a Spriggan like
you doing here?
Eugene

We didn't get to hang out for
long, but it was fun! Hope we
meet again some day.
Leafa

Get out of here and head for the
World Tree.
Leafa
20003_13_a
Thanks for trying Kirito, but this
is far enough. I'm gonna try and
save Sakuya.
Leafa
20003_12_a
We didn't make it after all...
Leafa
20003_11_a
Most likely the diplomats from the
Sylphs and Cait Siths. Fifty
seconds until they make contact.
Yui
20003_10_a
From what I can tell, it could
be the Salamander attack squad.
Fourteen more up ahead.
Yui

I've got player readings.
Sixty-eight of them flying
in formation.
Yui

...
Kirito

We just might end up dying
with them all in battle.
Leafa
20003_6_a
I know. Even if we can warn them,
it doesn't mean we'll get the
commanders out in time.
Leafa

Yui

No. It was pretty cool.

Wow, I sounded pretentious,
didn't I? Sorry about that.

...Thank you.
Leafa
19011_35_a
Kirito, I...
Leafa

still_19_kirito_smile
So no matter the reason, I'd never
attack friends for my own benefit.
I couldn't live with myself.
Kirito
19011_33_a
Leafa, you're a good person,
and I want to be your friend.
Kirito
19011_32_a
The player and the character
are one and the same.
Kirito
19011_31_a
If you give into your impulses in
here, it's gonna change who you
are in the real world.
Kirito
19011_30_a
Someone special taught me that.
Kirito
19011_29_a
But none of it's true. Here,
there's things you have to protect
because it's a virtual world.
Kirito
19011_28_a
And in a way, I get it.
Even I used to think like that.
Kirito
19011_27_a
A lot of people think like that.
More than I care to know.
Kirito
19011_26_a
...
Leafa
19011_25_a
If you want to kill, you kill.
If you want to steal, you steal.
Kirito
19011_24_a
It's just a game in the end.
Anything goes, right?
Kirito
19011_23_a
So...if you wanted to kill me,
you could. I wouldn't hold it
against you.
Leafa
19011_22_a
And since you're a Spriggan, they
might hire you as a mercenary.
Leafa
19011_21_a
If they pull this off, it'll give
them the power they need to make
an attempt at the World Tree.
Leafa
19011_20_a
But...you want to climb the World
Tree, so...you might be better off
working with the Salamanders...
Leafa
19011_19_a
If we go to the meeting, we won't
make it back alive. We'll have to
start over from Sylvain again.
Leafa
19011_18_a
...
Kirito
19011_17_a
This isn't your problem, Kirito!
It's a Sylph problem! You don't
need to risk your life over it!
Leafa
19011_16_a
Seriously! Would I lie to you?
Leafa
19011_15_a
still_19_salamander_fly
No way! Really?
Kirito
19011_14_a
still_19_salamander_fly
You can invade its home town for
ten days and charge whatever tax
you want.
Leafa
19011_13_a
still_19_salamander_fly
It'll also make you rich. If you
take out a territory's leader, you
get thirty percent of its money.
Leafa
19011_12_a
still_19_kirito_leafa
It's a good way to start a war
between the Cait Siths and the
Sylph, that's for sure.
Leafa
19011_11_a
still_19_kirito_leafa
Super pissed.
Kirito
19011_10_a
still_19_kirito_leafa
because a Sylph turned traitor,
they'd be pretty pissed, wouldn't
they?
Leafa
19011_9_a
still_19_kirito_leafa
For one, they'd stop the alliance
from happening. And if the Cait
Siths find out their leader died
Leafa
19011_8_a
still_19_kirito_leafa
If the Salamanders attack the
Sylphs and the Cait Siths,
what are they gonna get out of it?
Kirito

Go ahead.
Leafa

It'll take a while to get out of
here 'cause we can't fly.

Then I guess you'll just have to
explain it to me on the way.

If I had time to explain, believe
me I would. And I don't think I'll

There's more
Sakuya's allying us
with the Cait Sith. She's heading

Well, now I know why you kept
calling me IRL.
Suguha
19009_28_a

The Salamanders caught me.
I'm still in the sewers, paralyzed
by the poison arrow.
Nagata
19009_27_a
Keep going... Then what?
Suguha
19009_26_a
But I heard the Salamanders say
they put a tracer on you.
Nagata
19009_25_a
They were a little away from
me, so I couldn't hear everything.
Nagata
19009_24_a
I couldn't believe it! They were
Salamanders!
Nagata
19009_23_a
I followed them down into the
sewers, where these two sketchy
guys were waiting for 'em.
Nagata
19009_22_a
I tracked him to an alley. He and
a few others put on invisibility
cloaks. They were up to something.
Nagata
19009_21_a
Remember how I said something was
bugging me? I used a transparency
spell and followed Sigurd all day.
Nagata
19009_20_a
Do you have proof, or did you
just hear about it?
Suguha
19009_19_a
What?!
Suguha
19009_18_a
I found out he's been working as a
spy for the Salamanders,
probably for a while now.
Nagata
19009_17_a
Okay, here it is...
Nagata
19009_16_a
Yeah...I guess.
I mean, you're right. It's weird,
but what's your point?
Suguha
19009_15_a
still_19_sigurd
Don't you think it was out of
character? I mean, usually he'd
make someone else do it, right?
Nagata
19009_14_a
Yeah, now that you mention it...
Suguha
19009_13_a
Remember how Sigurd said he'd be
the decoy and then he lured three
of 'em away?
Nagata
19009_12_a
I don't know. Not really.
Why do you think it was weird?
Suguha
19009_11_a
Well, didn't that whole setup
seems a little weird to you?
Nagata
19009_10_a
Nrngh! But there's no time! Okay.
Remember when the Salamanders
ambushed us in the Ancient Forest?
Nagata
19009_9_a
Betrayed her...? How? Start from
the beginning and tell me
everything that happened.
Suguha
19009_8_a
And that's not all! He betrayed
Sakuya, the Sylph commander!
Nagata
19009_7_a
We got trouble. Like, big trouble!
Sigurd's coming after us!
Nagata
19009_6_a
I was dealing with some in-game
stuff.

please keep an eye on my avatar?

Okay, well, why don't you log out
and give him a call?
Kirito

Recon's not online.
Maybe he's asleep?

I totally forgot! I should message
him to see what's up.
Leafa
19008_13_a
Oh!
Leafa

Right before those Salamanders
attacked us, you got a message
from your friend.

Hmm?

Hey, I just remembered something.
Kirito

Bite me again and I'll cut you
in half.

Why's everyone ganging up on me?
I was trying to break the tension
with a stupid joke, is all...
Kirito

Kirito

So, uh...what'd they taste like?
Leafa

Oh yeah! I totally felt like a
monster, all eating people and
everything!
Kirito
19007_11_a
And you were chomping down on
them, remember that?
Yui
19007_10_a
I remember losing my sword,
and then...grabbing people.
Kirito
19007_9_a
I think I remember most of it this
time. I used the spell Yui told me
to and got huge-that was cool!
Kirito

Whoa... Scary.

Not really. It just happens
sometimes. I'll snap in battle

equipment, and we can't afford
that stuff.
Salamander K
19006_37_a

I doubt that. Someone figured that
to take the Tree, the whole army
would need ancient weapon-class
Salamander K
19006_36_a
They're gonna go try to clear the
World Tree, aren't they?
Leafa
19006_35_a
No way...
Leafa
19006_34_a
When I logged on today, I saw this
big-ass swarm of Salamander troops
heading up north.
Salamander K
19006_33_a
Hey, I'm just a grunt. They don't
tell me anything. But I think
something big's about to go down.
Salamander K
19006_32_a
Yeah? What plan?
Kirito
19006_31_a
9)3
The order came from the top.
Something about you "interfering
with the plan."
Salamander K
19006_30_a
Wait, why is Gtacs so interested
in getting us out of the way?
Leafa
19006_29_a
9)3
That was you guys, wasn't it?
Salamander K
19006_28_a
9)3
He's the leader of the lancer
squad, and he's known for hunting
Sylphs. He got beat up yesterday.
Salamander K
19006_27_a
Who's this Kagemune guy?
Kirito
19006_26_a
9)3
At first I thought it was overkill,
but he said you guys took out
Kagemune, so it made sense.
Salamander K
19006_25_a
9)3
And when I showed up, he said he
needed twelve of us to go on a
hunt for two players.
Salamander K
19006_24_a

Anyway, I got this text telling
us all to meet him here.

Leafa... I know you're good with

Kirito

If the Salamanders have high-level
earth magic, it can only mean one
thing. They have a powerful mage.
Leafa
19003_20_a
I'm not gonna argue with that,
but it won't be easy.
Leafa

Then I guess the only option
left is to fight.
Kirito

The Undines are the only ones who
can take those kinds of things on.

Nope. At least, not unless you

all day and it won't budge.

Leafa

Ugh, I never thought I'd be in a
game and have to memorize words
from a different language...
Kirito
19001_14_a
You have to learn what the words
of power mean, then match them
with the effects of the magic.
Leafa

No, you're just memorizing
the words.

anyone much in combat.

18008_14_a
In a field this size, it'd take
forever to find it.
Leafa
18008_13_a
If you can find it. The thing is,
if the caster's magic skill's high,
it can track you from far away.
Leafa
18008_12_a
Well, that's handy.
Can you dispel it?
Kirito
18008_11_a
Tracking magic. It looks like a
small animal or insect. It tells
the caster a target's position.

You can't log out here, remember?

Wait, rotate?

Pretty long. There's a mining town

It's the toughest area between

heard. Never been there myself.
Leafa

It's above the altitude limit, so
we can't fly over. The only way to
pass it is through the caves.

You should've seen his face when I

By the way, where do you think
I met him? It was in your

His real name is Kirigaya. I met
him in the real world recently.

That hero boyfriend of yours?
Goes by the name of Kirito?
Oberon

Well, I'm not planning on staying
in this cage forever. You'll see.
He'll come and save me.
Asuna

Because if that's the case, you
definitely need to take things
less seriously while you're here.
Oberon

Are you afraid you're going to
be corrupted somehow?
Oberon

I don't expect you to understand,
but to me, it doesn't matter if
my body's real or virtual.

It's not like that body's real.
Why can't you just loosen up and
enjoy yourself a little?

Yui

Honestly, your psychology is

all you want is companionship?
Yui

You humans are so complicated.
Yui

I don't understand why everyone's

Leafa

Yeah, well, I don't think it
could've happened any other way.
Leafa

Okay, but...I feel like it's sorta
my fault you left on bad terms
with those guys.

better. I've been thinking about

Party members aren't items, so

If you leave us, it's going to

Yes, I know what I said.
But you've been with us for a

You said I could join only when I
had the time. You also said I

It's been done in secret by just a

In fact, several countries are
researching it as we speak.
Oberon

You can't!

By expanding the brain's control
regions, one could...influence

Why help another race if they're

But if we have to work together

Hey, you got good instincts.
Everyone thinks it's a quest, so
they're out there looking for it.

quest? Or maybe it's designed so
that one race can't beat it alone?

No one's gotten past them.
Leafa
17005_25_a
They're that strong, huh?
Kirito
17005_24_a
But then you have to get past the
NPCs that guard it, and they're
super powerful.
Leafa

At the base of the tree there's a
big dome. That's the gateway to
the Floating City.
Leafa
17005_22_a
So how does someone get to the
top of the tree?
Kirito
17005_21_a
That's cool. It'd be sweet to fly
for as long as I want.
Kirito
17005_20_a
still_17_alf
The first race to reach him will
be reborn as Alfs and will be able to
fly for as long as they want!
Leafa
17005_19_a
still_17_world_tree
Well, at the top of the tree is
the Floating City, and in it lives
Oberon, the Fairy King.
Leafa
17005_18_a
You know how you're limited in how
high you can fly? No race can fly
for more than ten minutes.
Leafa
17005_17_a
You could say that's the grand
quest of Alfheim Online.
Leafa
17005_16_a
Join the club. Every player wants
to get to the top.
Leafa
17005_15_a
I want to get to the top
as soon as I can.
Kirito
17005_14_a
Actually, I was hoping you could
tell me what you knew about the
World Tree.
Kirito
17005_13_a
I don't know. If you ask me,
they're gearing up to try to clear
the World Tree soon.
Leafa
17005_12_a
But those guys were organized,
and that wasn't happening until
recently.
Leafa
17005_11_a
Well, for one thing, the Salamander
and Sylph races never got along.
Leafa
17005_10_a
Those guys in the forest were
playing pretty rough. Are gangs of
PKers normal for this game?
Kirito
17005_9_a
Ahem! Anyway, bottoms up!
And thanks again for saving me.
Leafa
17005_8_a
Oh, whatever! I know him in real
life! We go to the same school and
we're classmates, but that's it.
Leafa

standing, you guys seemed tight.
Kirito

Anyway, Sigurd and the others are
waiting for you at the tavern.
Recon

Gee, thanks a lot.
Kirito

No, he's cool. I'm pretty sure if
he really was a spy, he wouldn't
be such a ditz.
Leafa

You sure about him?!
He could be a spy or something!

Oh, hi. Nice to meetcha.
Wait, what am I talking about!

Hey there, my name's Kirito.
Kirito

This is my friend.
His name's Recon.
Leafa

No, it's okay. He saved me from
those Salamanders.
Leafa

A Spriggan...?!
Wh-What's going on here?!
Recon

I knew you'd survive! You are one

Wait a sec!
Recon

Leaaafa!
Thank God you're okay!
Recon

So this is a Sylph town...
Man, it's beautiful.
Kirito
17004_17_a
I really should have done some
research before jumping in...
Kirito
17004_16_a
Treasure hunting and illusion
magic. Neither of those things are
much help in battle though.
Leafa
17004_15_a
Different races have different
skills, huh? What are the
Spriggans good at?
Kirito
17004_14_a
But that's an important one anyone
can do, so you should learn it.

Imagine you've got virtual muscles
here and try to move 'em.

Well, there's a little trick to
doing it. Come on, turn around,
but don't access your controller.
Leafa

Of course.

without using the controller?

Let's get flying.

Just call me Leafa. If you really
wanna go there, okay. I can't
guarantee your safety though.

As long as I don't do anything to
provoke 'em, no one'll attack me.
And you'll be there, Miss Leafa.
Kirito

You're not a Sylph. If you're in
their territory, you can't attack
them but they can attack you.
Leafa

So?
Kirito

You really don't know anything
about this game.
Sylvain is Sylph territory.
Leafa

Okay, but what about Sylvain?
Isn't that town closer to us?
Kirito

There's this neutral village to
the north of us. It's a little out
of the way, but we can fly there.
Leafa

Oh, you mean the World Tree? Yeah,
sure. I might not look like it,
but I know a lot about this game.

And especially...about the tree.

No, the system will only allow me

A game where it's okay to die

and Asuna's picture was taken by

Apparently, ALO's main feature
is the ability to fly freely

Now I ask you... Is it wrong for me
to expect a little compensation
for my trouble?
Sugo

In other words, and without getting
into specifics, you could say I'm
the one keeping Asuna alive.
Sugo

And I work for the company's
FullDive technology R&D division.

The SAO servers were given to an

If anything, I have a right to
her. Perhaps I should explain why.

Who do you think you are?!
You can't take advantage of Asuna
like this!
Kazuto

Heh. For me, this situation is...

If I proposed and she could speak,
I'm pretty sure her answer would
be "no."

The truth is, she's always hated
me. Ever since we were kids.
Neither of our parents know that.

It's true, we can't legally marry.
But if the family adopts me, it'll
be as if we are...on paper, that is.

What?! No way!
You can't do that!
Kazuto

You see, Asuna and I will soon be
married.

That is unfortunate. It's going to
make for one complicated
relationship between you and me.

Uh huh.

Congratulations to you both

Kayaba

Yeah. Maybe it is.
Kirito

I still believe that it's out
there somewhere, in some other
world.
Kayaba
14004_32_a
And you know what, Kirito?
I still believe in it.
Kayaba
14004_31_a
For as long as I can remember,
all I wanted was to get to that
castle.
Kayaba
14004_30_a
...
Kirito
14004_29_a
And what it showed me was unlike
anything I could have imagined.
Kayaba
14004_28_a
I dreamed of building a castle and
a world that wasn't governed by
earthly laws and restrictions.
Kayaba
14004_27_a
Even as I developed the FullDive
system... No, it was long before
that...
Kayaba
14004_26_a
That's a good question.
It's been so long I've forgotten
the reason. Isn't that strange?
Kayaba
14004_25_a
Why...? What's the point?
Why did you do this?
Kirito
14004_24_a

Kirito
14004_23_a
They'll never return.
In any world, real or virtual, once
you're dead, you're gone.
Kayaba
14004_22_a
And what about the 4,000 people
who died? What about THEM?
Kirito
14004_21_a
The 6,147 players who survived
the game were logged out a few
seconds ago.
Kayaba
14004_20_a
You don't have to worry
about them.
Kayaba
14004_19_a
And all the players?
What happens to them?
Asuna

In about ten minutes, everything

Don't do it, Kirito!
I don't like it.
We should fall back!

Everyone will be able to log out,
no strings attached. How about it?
Heathcliff

Kirito

I'll give you a chance to fight
me one-on-one, here and now. I'll
even deactivate my immortality.
Heathcliff
14001_32_a
But before I go...
You deserve some sort of reward
for discovering my identity.
Heathcliff
14001_31_a
No, I have a better idea.
I shall wait for you in the Ruby

Oh no. That wouldn't be sporting

Kirito

But your power was something else.
Well, I suppose unforeseen
twists are the appeal of MMORPGs.
Heathcliff
14001_22_a
The player with the best reaction
time was to get Dual Blades and
face down the demon king.
Heathcliff
14001_21_a
Not a bad twist, right? One
thing's for sure
I always knew
you'd be the one to face me.
Heathcliff
14001_20_a
So the strongest player in the
game turns out to be the
traitorous final boss.
Kirito
14001_19_a
I am Akihiko Kayaba.
And yes, I was to be the final
boss on the top floor.
Heathcliff
14001_18_a
I hadn't planned to reveal
my identity until Floor 95,
but alas...
Heathcliff
14001_17_a
But you were so strong and so fast
that I had no choice but to
engage the system's assist mode.
Heathcliff
14001_16_a
Yes, I thought so.
I'm sorry it came to that myself.
Heathcliff
14001_15_a
The move you used to turn the
tables on me was way too fast.
Kirito
14001_14_a
The first time I knew something
was up was during our duel.
Kirito
14001_13_a
For curiosity's sake, would you
mind telling me how you figured
it out?
Heathcliff
14001_12_a
Isn't that right, Akihiko Kayaba?
Kirito
14001_11_a
But it's simple. Every kid knows
nothing's more boring than
watching an RPG.

Asuna
13006_33_a

Asuna

That means it doesn't matter
whether we beat the game or not,
everyone's on borrowed time.
Kirito

It's hard to believe we're gonna
survive like that for much longer.
Asuna

If that's where we all are right
now, on life support in hospital
beds...
Asuna

My guess is that's when players'
bodies were being moved to
hospitals in the real world.
Asuna

Most of the players suddenly went
offline for a few hours.
Asuna
13006_26_a
Do you remember what happened a
few weeks after the game launched?

Have you ever thought about what's

It'd be nice if we could do that.
Be together, every day...forever.
Asuna

I don't care if we make it out or
not. I just wanna live with you in

I'm sorry...
I guess I'm losing my nerve. All I
wanna do is run away with you.

You know what would happen if you

So you want to charge into
danger alone? And you expect me
to stay here where it's safe?
Asuna
13006_17_a
I'm scared.
If anything happened to you, I...
Kirito
13006_16_a
We won't be able to use teleport
crystals, so there's no telling
what could happen.
Kirito

Don't get mad, but, hear me out,
do you think you could wait here
instead of fighting the boss?
Kirito

Hey, what's wrong?
Asuna
13006_13_a
We've still got three hours to go.
What should we do?
Asuna

A person with someone to protect
is a strong ally indeed. I expect
a good fight from you.
Heathcliff

If things start to get hairy in
there, I'm protecting her, not the
party.
Kirito
13006_10_a
You can count on us to fight with
you. But let me be clear... Asuna's
safety is my priority.
Kirito
13006_9_a
Which means we can't give up now.
We're launching an attack with the
largest group we can assemble.
Heathcliff
13006_8_a
You're kidding!
Kirito
13006_7_a
Precisely. After just five minutes
the doors reopened...
But the room was empty.
Heathcliff
13006_6_a
They walked into an anti-crystal
area...
Kirito
13006_5_a
Ten of them reached the center of
the room. That's when the boss
appeared and the entrance closed.
Heathcliff
13006_4_a
They were scouting for the
upcoming boss fight. Twenty men,
taken from five different guilds.

The recon team was wiped out?!
Kirito
13006_1_a
Don't worry.
We'll go fishing again.
Kirito
13005_26_a
I wish I could do more to help,
but such is life.
Nishida
13005_25_a
You're absolutely right.
Life isn't so bad here.
In fact, it's pretty damn good!
Nishida
13005_24_a
You must have something to live
for too. Don't you?
Asuna
13005_23_a
Meeting him was the reason I put
on the NerveGear that day.
Asuna
13005_22_a
Kirito is what these last two
years were about. He's proof I'm
alive.
Asuna
13005_21_a
I began looking forward to seeing
him again. For the first time, I
was happy to be here.
Asuna
13005_20_a
When I thought about him before
bed, I stopped having nightmares.
Asuna
13005_19_a
Asuna...
Kirito
13005_18_a
I learned so much from him.
And by "him," I mean Kirito.
Asuna
13005_17_a
He was truly alive in this world.
He wasn't losing days in the real
world. He was gaining them here.
Asuna
13005_16_a
Anyway, we formed our own party.
That's when I realized something.
Asuna
13005_15_a
So I tried lying down too.
And you know what?
I slept like a baby.
Asuna
13005_14_a
It'd be a waste to go into
some dungeon on such a
beautiful day, he told me.
Asuna
13005_13_a
That's when he said "This is
Aincrad's nicest season, and the
weather's at its optimal setting."
Asuna
13005_12_a
I was walking along one day and I
saw someone napping in the shade.
I got mad at him for wasting time.
Asuna
13005_11_a
So I cried. And afterwards, I'd
go and fight as hard as I could.
All I cared about was leveling up.
Asuna
13005_10_a
It felt like every day that went
by in here was another day lost.
It nearly broke me.
Asuna
13005_9_a
I used to feel the same way,
at first. Every night I'd cry
myself to sleep.
Asuna
13005_8_a
I figured passing time with a
fishing pole in my mitts was the
best thing for me. Sad, right?
Nishida
13005_7_a
Maybe deep down inside, I've given
up hope of ever getting out.
Nishida
13005_6_a
I've been here for two years now.
Can I even go back to work
if I make it out alive?
Nishida
13005_5_a
...
Kirito
13005_4_a
The people trying to beat this
game might as well have been from
another planet before I met you!
Nishida
13005_3_a
Well, it was an honor and
a privilege.
Nishida
13005_2_a
bg_13_coral_lake_transport
Thanks for seeing us off. I know
we didn't get to spend much time
together, but it was fun.
Kirito
13005_1_a
Okay, you're right.
Kirito
13004_12_a
Let's at least hear what he's got
to say. We'll take care of this
and come right back.
Asuna
13004_11_a
Yeah... But still...
Kirito
13004_10_a
He wouldn't call us to the front
lines during our vacation unless
something big happened.
Asuna

But it's only been two weeks...

Oh well.
They'll understand if you take
tonight off...
Asuna
13002_25_a
Yeah... I promised I'd save
everyone...
Kirito
13002_24_a
Everyone expects great things
from you now, and guess what?
So do I. Talk about pressure, huh?
Asuna
13002_23_a
For me, I wasn't getting stronger
for anyone else. It was just about
me staying alive.
Kirito
13002_22_a
And since we're on the front lines,
their lives have sort of become
our responsibility, haven't they?
Asuna
13002_21_a
Isn't it funny? So many people
are living normal lives in this
world.
Asuna
13002_20_a
When you both showed up,
I was like "Who IS this person?"
Asuna
13002_19_a
He is pretty cool, though,
don't you think?
Kirito
13002_18_a
You're the only one I know
who could figure it out.
Asuna
13002_17_a
bg_11_home_bedroom_night
I don't mind helping him out,
but how am I supposed to do a
switch move with a fishing pole?
Kirito
13002_16_a
Asuna
13002_15_a
I was wondering...
Do you have any plans for
tomorrow?
Nishida
13002_14_a
Yep, I've hooked him quite a few
times. But he's strong
he always
yanks the pole out of my hands!
Nishida
13002_13_a
Seriously?
Asuna
13002_12_a
Yes, good question!
That lake is the home of
the king of all fish!
Nishida
13002_11_a
What?!
Why would someone design it like
that?!
Kirito
13002_10_a
Actually that's not true. The
only lake that's really tough is
the one you were at today.
Nishida
13002_9_a
Yeah, well, maybe if all the lakes
on this floor weren't so hard...!
Kirito
13002_8_a
I'm asking because Kirito hasn't
been able to catch anything yet.
Asuna
13002_7_a
Glad you liked it.
By the way, how high is your
fishing skill?
Asuna
13002_6_a
Really?!
Ma'am, my taste buds bow down
before you!
Nishida
13002_5_a
Actually, I made it myself.
If you want, you can take some
home with you.
Asuna
13002_4_a
That was an amazing meal.
I had no idea you could get
soy sauce in this world!

Nishida

I, uh, might be able to help
you out with that...
Kirito
13001_17_a
I can catch 'em, but I can't cook
'em. I'd stew 'em or make sashimi,
but I don't have any soy sauce!
Nishida
13001_16_a
Whoa! Awesome!
Kirito
13001_15_a
Yeah... But I've caught bigger!
Nishida

It's a big one!

Ooh!

Kirito

Yep, we were the folks in charge
of network security for this game.
Nishida
13001_10_a
I'm Kirito. Hey, wasn't Toto
the company that-?
Kirito
13001_9_a
My name's Nishida. I ran network
security for Toto Broadband in
Japan, but in here I'm a fisherman.
Nishida

A-And you are...?
Kirito

Sorry, I didn't mean to sneak up
on you like that.

Good luck, Mommy.
Yui
12007_58_a
Yeah. We'll see her again.
Kirito
12007_57_a
Okay. As long as we can be a
family again. We'll see her when
we get back! Our first child...
Asuna
12007_56_a
Recreating her the way she was
won't be easy, but we'll find a
way.
Kirito
12007_55_a
Don't worry. I've set her data to
save to the local memory on
my NerveGear.
Kirito
12007_54_a
What's going to happen to Yui
if we do end up beating the game

revoked her admin credentials.

able to use the GM's account
to get into the system.

You have to stay with us!
I can't be happy without you!
Asuna
12007_40_a
Please continue my work.
Keep helping people.
Share your joy. For me.
Yui
12007_39_a
Whenever you two are around, you
have a way of making people smile.
Yui

No! This isn't right!
Stay with us!
Asuna
12007_37_a
Thank you, Mommy and Daddy.
This is goodbye.
Yui
12007_36_a
That can't be...
Asuna
12007_35_a
The system thinks I'm a foreign
object now. I'll probably be
deleted.
Yui
12007_34_a
I used it to access the system and
delete that monster. But now I've
disobeyed Cardinal's directive.
Yui
12007_33_a
It's also a console the GM can use
to gain emergency access to the
system.
Yui
12007_32_a
When I ran from the safe zone,
I came in contact with this rock.
It restored my memory, but...
Yui
12007_31_a
For what?
Kirito
12007_30_a
It's too late...
Yui
12007_29_a
still_12_yui_hug
Yeah. Remember, you're our child.

I want to stay with you forever,
Mommy and Daddy!
Yui
12007_26_a
You aren't just some program
anymore. The system can't control
you. Just tell us what you want.
Kirito
12007_25_a
Yui, maybe what you're feeling are
real human emotions...
Asuna
12007_24_a
Isn't that strange? I shouldn't be
able to have thoughts like that.
I'm not human. I'm just a program.
Yui
12007_23_a
Yes...
I've wanted to meet the two
of you for the longest time...
Yui
12007_22_a
So that's how you ended up in the
forest on Floor 22?
Asuna
12007_21_a
I wanted to get close to you two,
so I created this avatar.
Yui
12007_20_a
Then one day I saw two players
with mental signatures vastly
different from the others.
Yui

still_12_yui_breakdown
Slowly but surely, I accumulated
errors and began to fall apart.
Yui

Under normal circumstances, I'd
have attended to these players.
But I was forbidden from doing so.
Yui

still_12_yui_monitor
Terror, despair, and rage overtook
people. Some of them couldn't take
it. They went completely insane.
Yui

still_12_yui_monitor
They were in a terrible situation.
Yui

still_12_yui_monitor
I wasn't allowed to assist them.
All I could do was monitor
their mental states.
Yui

Two years ago, on launch day,
Cardinal blocked my interactions
with players for unknown reasons.
Yui
12007_13_a
But what about your amnesia?
Can that even happen to an AI?
Asuna
12007_12_a
Nothing about me is real.
Not even my tears.
I'm so sorry, Asuna.
Yui
12007_11_a
I was designed to put players at
ease. That's why I can emulate
complex emotions.
Yui
12007_10_a
You're a program?
An AI?
Asuna

That's me.

12003_10_a
Don't worry. I'm not afraid!
Yui
12003_9_a
The thing is, the monsters here
are usually around Level 60.
That's not easy hunting for him.
Yulier
12003_8_a
Exclusive access to spawns can
be pretty profitable.
Kirito
12003_7_a
I bet Kibaou was planning on
keeping this place all to himself.
Yulier
12003_6_a
I think the dungeon opens up to
reveal more as the floors above
are completed.
Yulier
12003_5_a
I know. There wasn't anything like
this during the beta test.
Kirito
12003_4_a
I never knew this dungeon was
under the Town of Beginnings.

here with me?

someone important to you.
Asuna
12001_48_a
Thank you so much.
Yulier
12001_47_a
Whatever you say, Mr. Easygoing.
Okay, we'll help. I just hope
we're strong enough for the job.
Asuna
12001_46_a
Well, I'd rather trust her and
regret it than not trust her at
all. It'll all work out, right?
Kirito
12001_45_a
Mm-hm. I don't know how to explain
it, but she is.
Yui
12001_44_a
Yui, you mean you can tell?
Asuna
12001_43_a
It's okay, Mommy.
She's telling the truth.
Yui
12001_42_a
But when I think about him trapped
alone in there...I feel like I'm
going insane!
Yulier
12001_41_a
I know we just met, and that this
is asking a lot of you, but...
Yulier
12001_40_a
If you think we can help get him
out of there, we'd be glad to help.
But we need to verify your story.
Asuna
12001_39_a
I tracked you down because I need
your help. I beg you. Please help
me save Thinker!
Yulier
12001_38_a
When I heard that two of the most
powerful players were here in town,
I knew you were my only hope.
Yulier
12001_37_a
As the second in command, his
rescue falls to me. But I can't
reach him at my level either.
Yulier
12001_36_a
The dungeon is the highest level
we've encountered so far.
He can't get out on his own.
Yulier
12001_35_a
He's been gone that long?!
Can't he find his way out?
Asuna
12001_34_a
He took Kibaou at his word, that he
wanted to talk, unarmed.
That was three days ago.
Yulier
12001_33_a
Can't he teleport out?
Kirito
12001_32_a
He set a trap and stranded
Thinker deep inside a dungeon.
Yulier
12001_31_a
His back is against the wall, so
he's decided to eliminate Thinker.
Yulier
12001_30_a
Kibaou was denounced after
spearheading that massacre.
We considered kicking him out.
Yulier
12001_29_a
Corvatz...!
Asuna
12001_28_a
So he sent the highest-level
players he had to the front lines
to quell the criticism.
Yulier
12001_27_a
It was obvious that Kibaou didn't
care about beating the game, and
that upset a lot of people.
Yulier
12001_26_a
They're out of control, extorting
other players under the guise of
"collecting taxes."
Yulier
12001_25_a
His group continued to amass power
until they'd taken over all the
best monster spawn points.
Yulier
12001_24_a
Right. After much infighting, one
man became very powerful.
His name is Kibaou.
Yulier
12001_23_a
But then it grew too large,
didn't it?
Kirito
12001_22_a
The guild's original mission was
to share information and food
equally with as many as possible.
Yulier
12001_21_a
Our guild leader, Thinker, never
intended for the organization
to turn dictatorial.
Yulier

Seriously?
Asuna

their place. In fact, I'd like to
ask you two for your help.
Yulier

No, quite the opposite.
I'm here to thank you. You did
well to put those men in
Yulier

Hm? Someone's at the door.
Sasha

I see. Well, back to square one...
Asuna
12001_12_a
I walk through town looking for
kids who might need help.
But I haven't seen Yui before.
Sasha
12001_11_a
When the game first started, a lot
of the children suffered severe
psychological trauma. Every day...
Sasha
12001_10_a
Sorry, I haven't. There are a lot
of kids in town, but I've never
seen her.
Sasha
12001_9_a
Have you ever seen her before?
Asuna
12001_8_a
So that's the reason we came here.
We thought maybe someone would
know who she is.
Asuna
12001_7_a
She's lost her memory, the poor
thing.
Asuna
12001_6_a
We have no idea.
We found her on Floor 22,
wandering in the forest.
Asuna

Has this ever happened before?

You're right.
Okay, we'll go to the Town of
Beginnings when she wakes up.
Asuna

This doesn't mean we'll never meet

I bet they're worried about her.
Kirito

...Mm-hm.
Asuna

There's something about her
presence that makes this little

Look, I don't want to say goodbye
to her either.
Kirito
11008_10_a
Okay...
Asuna

We'll do what we can for now.
We'll check the Town of Beginnings
for any sign of her family.
Kirito
11008_8_a
But it's a catch-22. We have to
get back to clearing the game
so we can set her free.

I don't know what to do.

She has to be a player.
She's probably been wandering
out there for a while, lost.

And she's not a quest giver either.
Our quest logs would've updated

And then...

I'm pretty tired of it too.

to the battlefield now.

Kirito

Listen... I was thinking maybe we
could leave the front lines for
a while.
Asuna

The last two years have been very
special to me. I realize that now.
Asuna

Of course I do. It's just, I don't
want my life here to disappear,

Don't you wanna go back?

But it wasn't. I'm so glad it
wasn't a dream.

And in my dream, everything that's
happened here in Aincrad was just

No, but when we're finished,

consider this your first mission.
Heathcliff

but his defense is incredible.

Yeah, okay. If you wanna settle
this with swords, that's fine by

On the other hand, if you lose...
you will join the Knights of the

If you can defeat me in combat,
you'll be free to take Asuna
with you.
Heathcliff

If you want her, you'll have to
use your Dual Blades skill to
take her from us.
Heathcliff

But you must understand that we
cannot allow our vice commander to
leave the guild so easily.
Heathcliff
9010_18_a
You have my sincerest apologies
for any trouble you had with
Kuradeel.
Heathcliff
9010_17_a
If she's that important, maybe you
should do a better job of picking
her bodyguard.
Kirito

And now here you are, trying to
poach one of our best players.
I don't know what to say.
Heathcliff
9010_15_a
We may be the top guild,
but we barely get by with the
amount of troops we have.
Heathcliff

Yes, that was a difficult battle.
We nearly lost some players, too.
Heathcliff

Well, there was that conference
on Floor 67, Commander Heathcliff.

have something they didn't.

But if anyone else found out I had
a skill like this...
Kirito

It's not on the info broker's

you've got a unique skill!

it by now.

That wasn't a boss fight. It was

because they think it looks dumb.
Asuna

is that you can also use a shield.
But now that I think about it,

Kuradeel. As vice commander of

A-Asuna... I don't know how, but

Y-You punk!

Sorry, but I'll be borrowing your

I work better alone, anyway. And

just get in the way.
Kirito

Yeah, well, I'm pretty careful.
Kirito
8006_33_a
There are things a solo player
can't handle. Unexpected things.
Warping out isn't always an option.
Asuna

Yeah...
Kirito
8006_31_a
Things are getting more dangerous.
The monster algorithms
are even more irregular.
Asuna

I know that beta players don't
fit in with the guilds. But ever
since we got to Floor 70...
Asuna

And you're okay with that?
Asuna

...Whatever, I'm a solo player.
Kirito

Heh, you should see your face!
I guess you've never had
a girlfriend before, hm?
Asuna

Wha-!
Kirito

I've seen that same look on guys'

before they propose to me.
Asuna

What?
Kirito
8006_23_a
Nuh uh, don't go there.
Asuna
8006_22_a
I know how you feel. And it's not
fair to all the people who still
count on us if we give up.
Kirito
8006_21_a
I mean, there are things I haven't
done yet. I have to!
Asuna
8006_20_a
But I want to go back.
Asuna

...
Kirito

I guess they're all used to this

Asuna
8006_17_a
It's not just me. These days, more
and more people don't seem to care
about getting out of here.
Kirito
8006_16_a
Me too... In fact, there's days
I don't even think about the
real world at all.
Kirito
8006_15_a
It's so weird. Sometimes, I get
this feeling that I've lived here

Asuna

Yeah, me too.
Kirito

Heh, all done!
Asuna
8006_9_a
That takes care of that. Now for
the next step. I was thinking about
making a couple side dishes.
Asuna
8006_8_a
Cooking in SAO is so simple.
Believe it or not,
it's kind of boring.
Asuna
8006_7_a
In real life, there'd be
a lot more steps involved
in preparing this.
Asuna
8006_6_a
Ragout... That's pretty much
the definition of a stew.
Asuna
8006_5_a
In that case...
How about we make it into a stew?
Asuna
8006_4_a
I thought I'd leave that decision
up to the chef.
Kirito
8006_3_a
item_08_ragout_rabbit
So this is the legendary S-class

want this cooked up?

but blowing it all on a flat...?

Umm, the room and the furniture
cost around four million Col...
Anyway, make yourself at home.
Asuna

How much did all this cost?

we better hurry. It's getting dark.
Asuna
8005_9_a
...
Kirito
8005_8_a
Then more people kept joining up.
When we became the strongest guild,
everything started getting weird.
Asuna
8005_7_a
It's dumb. The guild didn't have
all these rules and regulations
before. We were really small.
Asuna
8005_6_a
Anyway, what's the deal with that
guy back there? He was mad-dogging
me like crazy...
Kirito
8005_5_a
I don't know, this floor seems way
out of my price range...
Kirito

If you like it so much,
why don't you move here?

about are themselves!

Yeah, what if I am?
Kirito

Are you implying I'm inferior to
him? Oh, I know. He's one of those

Kuradeel

I don't know how shady he is, but I
do know he is skilled. Ten levels
above you, in fact, Kuradeel.

I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't
allow you to go home with such

And that's not just an ingot,

thought. It's the dragon's nest.
Kirito

Awesome!

How can you be so sure there is? I

You're wrong, Grimlock. You've
got it all wrong.

Someday you'll understand. Once
you've found love, believe me,
you'll do anything to keep it.
Grimlock

That's why you did it?
That's the reason you killed
your wife?!
Kirito

If I couldn't have the Yuko I loved
back, I'd settle for the memory of
her. And who could blame me!

But then I realized I didn't have
to live with the way she was.
Murder is part of this game!
Grimlock

There was nothing I could do about
it. She changed. The Yuko I loved
was gone! Gone!
Grimlock

But she looked so much happier here.
More alive than she ever did
in the real world.

In here, I was the one who was
afraid, terrified of playing this
death game.

But when we were trapped in here,
in this world...
she changed.

In a way, she was the perfect wife.
Ideal. So pretty, so submissive.

And because she was also my
wife in the real world.

No matter what, I had to kill her
while we were still stuck here.
While she was still my wife.

Money?
Did you say money?
No, it wasn't for the money.
Grimlock

Was the money so important
you'd kill your own wife for it?!

Hello. Long time no see, comrades.

If you wanna know more,
you can ask the man yourself.

Oh my God...

Yeah. My guess is it was probably
the same bunch he hired to
kill Griselda.
Kirito

That's it. That's why. They knew
we'd be here because
he hired them!
Schmitt

All he had to do was wait for
you, Schmitt, and Kains to get
together. You'd be sitting ducks.
Kirito

It was the perfect chance for him
to bury the ring incident and
any witnesses, once and for all.
Kirito

You explained your plan to him in
detail, didn't you?
Kirito

My God... But then if he really
did have her killed, why would he
go to the trouble to help us?
Yolko

No, I doubt he was the one who
killed her. I'm pretty sure he
got a red player to do it for him.

It was Grimlock?
Then he killed Griselda!

Ah! And if everything goes to the
spouse, then the ring in

Everything would go to the
surviving spouse, right?

Hm. If one of them died...
Asuna

Huh? If you're talking about
Griselda and Grimlock...

Okay, say your spouse dies.

Sorry, but he had a different
reason for not liking your plan.
Griselda had nothing to do with it.
Kirito
6009_17_a
All he wanted was
to let Griselda rest in peace.
Yolko
6009_16_a
We did, but he was against our
plan from the beginning.
Yolko
6009_15_a
Hey, Kains, Yolko-level with me.
You guys asked Grimlock to make
the spear and knife, didn't you?
Kirito
6009_14_a
I didn't figure anything out.
I was acting on a hunch is all.
Kirito
6009_13_a
How did you know those three
would attack us here?
Schmitt
6009_12_a
Kirito.
Thank you for saving me, but...
how did you figure it out?
Schmitt
6009_11_a
You won't believe me, but after it
was over, I was going to tell
you the truth.
Yolko
6009_10_a
Nice to see you alive again,
Yolko.
Kirito
6009_9_a
...Come on.
Orange Player A
6009_8_a
So, now what? I got thirty players
from the Assault Team coming. You
guys wanna stay and fight 'em?
Kirito
6009_7_a
Looks like I made it just in time.
Kirito
6009_6_a
Tch...
Orange Player A
6009_5_a
Ow-!
Kirito

Schmitt
6008_8_a
Alright, let's get this show
on the road.
Orange Player A
6008_7_a
Oh, come on! You spoiled it!
It's no fun if they know
they're gonna die!
Orange Player B
6008_6_a
I know it's your favorite, but
last time we did that, you
killed the winner anyway.
Orange Player A
6008_5_a
Let's play the one where they have
to kill each other! Last one
standing wins!
Orange Player B
6008_4_a
Oh, I know, I know!
Orange Player B
6008_3_a
Alright, what game should we play
with these three?
Orange Player A
6008_2_a
bg_06_graveyard
Schmitt
6008_1_a
Wait-that's it! Shared storage!
Kirito
6007_19_a
For your information, the word
"pragmatic" means "practical"!
Asuna
6007_18_a
What I said is it's
romantic and pragmatic!
Asuna
6007_17_a
I did NOT say that, you ass!
Asuna
6007_16_a
Wait, that didn't come out right!
You were talking about how it's
romantic and plastic and-!
Kirito
6007_15_a
...!!
Asuna
6007_14_a
Hey, so uh, how many times you
been married, anyway?
Kirito
6007_13_a
At the same time, I think it's
also very romantic.
Asuna
6007_12_a
I think sharing storage with the
person you're married to is
wonderfully pragmatic.
Asuna
6007_11_a
If you're single, you can hide
whatever you want, but when you're
married, you can't hide it anymore.
Asuna
6007_10_a
Think about it. If you marry, you
have to share your item storage.
Asuna
6007_9_a
Also, the rules my guild play by
give the concept of marriage in
this world real meaning.
Asuna
6007_8_a
Our way, no one can hoard stuff,
because we worked out who gets
what ahead of time.
Asuna
6007_7_a
You know how in SAO, if a player
gets a drop, no one knows unless
that person reports it?
Asuna
6007_6_a
In my guild, the one who got the
kill gets it. Those are the rules
we have to play by.
Asuna
6007_5_a
Oh, I don't know... Part of the
reason I play solo is so I can
avoid situations like that.
Kirito
6007_4_a
Hey, if you were in their guild
and a super rare item like that
dropped, what would you have done?
Asuna
6007_3_a
We ended up playing right into
Yolko's hands, didn't we?
Kirito
6007_2_a
bg_05_restaurant
Asuna
6007_1_a
Laughing Coffin,
the murder guild...
Schmitt
6006_15_a
That's a hell of a catch.
A big shot from the
Holy Dragon Alliance.
Orange Player A
6006_14_a
No way...
Schmitt
6006_13_a
Huh?!
Yolko
6006_12_a
One down!
Orange Player B
6006_11_a
bg_06_graveyard
Paralysis?!
Schmitt
6006_9_a
Yolko

bg_black
Schmitt
6006_8_a
bg_06_graveyard
Yolko
6006_7_a
I do feel guilty getting money for
my part in it, but the weapon I
bought got me into the Alliance, so-
Schmitt
6006_6_a
No! I didn't hate her, honest!
Schmitt
6006_5_a
Of course we did. But you didn't
betray her because you hated her,
did you?
Kains
6006_4_a
So that's how it is, huh?
You cared about what happened
to Griselda after all...
Schmitt
6006_3_a
You were...recording?
Schmitt
6006_2_a
bg_06_graveyard
Yolko
6006_1_a
That's it, then. I guess they can
handle it from here. Our job's
pretty much done, wouldn't you say?
Kirito
6005_14_a
Right now she's in the field on
Floor 19. It looks like she's on
a small hill outside of town.
Asuna
6005_13_a
Hey, you still have Yolko on your
friend list, don't you?
Kirito
6005_12_a
And Schmitt was the person they
picked for it, probably since the
beginning.
Kirito
6005_11_a
The only way to find out for sure
was by faking their deaths and
creating an illusionary avenger.
Asuna
6005_10_a
Everything they did was designed
to draw out the person behind
Griselda's murder and expose him.
Asuna
6005_9_a
Getting people to think they were
murdered in a safe zone was
a calculated twist.
Kirito
6005_8_a
He and Yolko were in it together.
They figured out how to use this
method to fake their own deaths.
Kirito
6005_7_a
Kains. I'm almost positive.
Kirito
6005_6_a
Who was the person in the black
robe you chased?
Asuna
6005_5_a
She kept an eye on her cloak's
durability. When it hit zero, she
acted like she'd been stabbed.
Kirito
6005_4_a
I bet the dagger was rigged to her
back the whole time. She had it
all planned out.
Kirito
6005_3_a
Then what happened to Yolko?
Asuna
6005_2_a
bg_05_marten_inn
Kirito
6005_1_a
Sure, it looks a lot like what
happens when a player dies in
the game. Only he didn't die.
Kirito
6004_13_a
...!
Asuna
6004_12_a
Poof. Kains used a crystal
to teleport out of his armor.
Kirito
6004_11_a
Yep, just his armor, nothing else.
And at the precise second when
his armor's durability expired-
Kirito
6004_10_a
So then, his body didn't
disintegrate. It was-
Asuna
6004_9_a
It wasn't draining his HP though.
It was draining the durability
of his armor.
Kirito
6004_8_a
That day, the spear was sticking
out of Kains's armor.
Kirito
6004_7_a
...
Asuna
6004_6_a
But the durability of an object
does. Just like that sandwich
you gave me.
Kirito
6004_5_a
Inside safe zones, a player's
HP doesn't deplete on its own.
Kirito
6004_4_a
Yup, they're alive.
Both Yolko and Kains.
Kirito
6004_3_a
Wait, they're alive?!
Asuna
6004_2_a
bg_05_marten_inn
Kirito
6004_1_a
...!
Schmitt
6003_11_a
item_03_record_crystal
We recorded everything you said,
Schmitt.
Yolko
6003_10_a
Please, believe me!
Schmitt
6003_9_a
That's all I did! I swear!
I didn't want her to die! I didn't
want to be part of that!
Schmitt
6003_8_a
Then what?
Mysterious Woman
6003_7_a
so whoever it was could get in.
Then I had to put the crystal
in the guild shared storage...
Schmitt
6003_6_a
The note said for me to bind the
crystal to Griselda's room at
the inn she was staying at,
Schmitt
6003_5_a
I don't know!
I swear I don't know!
Schmitt
6003_4_a
Who gave you them?
Mysterious Man
6003_3_a
Mysterious Woman

bg_06_graveyard
Schmitt
6003_1_a
I don't know!

Schmitt
6002_13_a
Tell me. I want to know
who gave you those instructions.
Mysterious Man
6002_12_a
Grimlock? You're dead too?
Schmitt
6002_11_a
Who gave you them?
Mysterious Man
6002_10_a
Who were they from, Schmitt?
Mysterious Man
6002_9_a
I-I looked at my belt pouch-
there was a crystal and a note
with instructions!
Schmitt
6002_8_a
Okay, okay!
The day we voted to sell the ring,
Schmitt
6002_7_a
G-G-Ghost!!
Schmitt
6002_6_a
What did you do to me? Tell me,
Schmitt. Tell me what you did.
Mysterious Woman
6002_5_a
Oh, really?
Mysterious Woman
6002_4_a
I swear, I never thought this was
going to happen! You have
to believe me!
Schmitt
6002_3_a
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Please forgive me, Griselda!
Schmitt
6002_2_a
bg_06_graveyard
Griselda... The only way I can be
saved now is if you forgive me...
Schmitt
6002_1_a
I was right. The game doesn't
allow killing inside a safe zone.
There's no weapon or system exploit!
Kirito
6001_57_a
I-no, wait-WE never saw a thing!
We just thought we did. But we
were seeing something else!
Kirito
6001_56_a
What's it?
What did you just figure out?
Asuna
6001_55_a
Aha!
No way!
That's right... That's it!
Kirito
6001_54_a
Teleport stone... Durability...
Kirito
6001_53_a
Come on, it's just a sandwich...
Asuna
6001_52_a
Wait a second...
Something's wrong...
Kirito
6001_51_a
Kirito
6001_50_a
bg_05_marten_inn
Should've been eating
instead of talking.
Asuna
6001_49_a
bg_black
My sandwich...
Kirito
6001_48_a
Asuna
6001_47_a
Hn-! Ah!
It fell-!
Kirito
6001_46_a
Tch!
Asuna
6001_45_a
W-Wow. Well, if you're looking for
a second career, you'd make a
killing selling these. Hehehe!
Kirito
6001_44_a
I made them.
Yes, I can cook. So what?
Asuna
6001_43_a
Huh?
Kirito
6001_42_a
I didn't.
Asuna
6001_41_a
It's delicious. Where'd you buy
these, anyway?
Kirito
6001_40_a
Uh, okay, thanks. Thank you.
Kirito
6001_39_a
No, I'm just showing it off. Hurry
up and eat it before it disappears
its durability is almost zero.
Asuna
6001_38_a
What, is that for me?
Kirito
6001_37_a
item_06_asuna_sandwich
Here.
Asuna
6001_36_a
No, it's nothing...
Kirito
6001_35_a
What is it?
Asuna
6001_34_a
Teleport crystal...
Kirito
6001_33_a
I'd bet my life on it. Why would
a ghost need a teleport crystal?
Kirito
6001_32_a
No. That definitely wasn't
a ghost.
Kirito
6001_31_a
After seeing two people die
mysteriously, I'm starting to think
it's possible.
Asuna
6001_30_a
I don't know what to think. Was
that black-robed figure
Griselda's ghost?
Asuna
6001_29_a
bg_05_marten_inn
Kirito
6001_28_a
Someone's using the system to kill.
That's the only way these murders
could've happened in a safe zone!
Kirito
6001_27_a
...
Asuna
6001_26_a
That wasn't a ghost.
Kirito
6001_25_a
Hehe. Think about it. Only a ghost
can PK someone in a safe zone.
Hehe, ahahahahaha!
Schmitt
6001_24_a
That was Griselda's ghost. She's
come back to get revenge on us!
Schmitt
6001_23_a
...!
Kirito & Asuna
6001_22_a
Kirito
6001_21_a
That robe was Griselda's...
Schmitt
6001_20_a
Dammit!
Kirito
6001_19_a
The system's supposed to protect
players inside the inns. I thought
if anywhere, she'd be safe here.
Kirito
6001_18_a
I lost him.
He teleported off somewhere.
Kirito
6001_17_a
Well? What happened?
Asuna
6001_16_a
You idiot! What's your problem?
Asuna

How can you accept being killed
over some stupid vendetta?!
Schmitt
5011_18_a
You can't be okay with this, Yolko!
Schmitt
5011_17_a
You gotta be kidding...
You gotta be kidding! Why now,
after all this time?!
Schmitt
5011_16_a
You see, he's the only one of us
who can avenge Griselda... He's
the only one who has the right...
Yolko
5011_15_a
Grimlock was the only member of
the guild who said we should leave
the decision to Griselda...
Yolko
5011_14_a
Her fate was sealed when that ring
dropped! We shouldn't have voted!
We should've obeyed Griselda!
Yolko
5011_13_a
It was everyone's fault! Everyone
in the guild is guilty! Her blood
is on all our hands!
Yolko
5011_12_a
...!
Kirito
5011_11_a
Wha-?!
Schmitt
5011_10_a
A player can't kill another player
inside a safe zone. But something
else, like a ghost, could...
Yolko
5011_9_a
...?
Schmitt
5011_8_a
Or maybe...Griselda's come back
from the dead to get her revenge.
Yolko
5011_7_a
Maybe Grimlock made the spear for
someone else from our guild...
Yolko
5011_6_a
Does Grimlock want to kill the
three of us because we didn't want
to sell the damn ring?!
Schmitt
5011_5_a
But why wait so long to kill him?
Unless... Wait, could he have
stolen the ring?
Schmitt
5011_4_a
There's no doubt.
Yolko
5011_3_a
So that's what killed Kains. And
you're sure about the spear?
Was it really Grimlock's?
Schmitt
5011_2_a
bg_05_marten_room
Yolko
5011_1_a
Well, we should go find Schmitt.
Asuna
5010_12_a
I see...
Asuna
5010_11_a
So there's no way the game would
allow murders in safe zones.
Kirito
5010_10_a
Because it's unfair. The rules of
SAO are essentially fair for every
player in the game.
Kirito
5010_9_a
What do you mean?
Asuna
5010_8_a
No, on second thought, that third
idea's impossible.
Kirito
5010_7_a
Use something to bypass the
protection of a safe zone. Some
kind of skill, or maybe an item...
Kirito
5010_6_a
Yeah, I can see that happening.
And the third?
Asuna
5010_5_a
Or maybe someone took advantage
of a bug that combines a bunch of
different kill methods.
Kirito
5010_4_a
I can see three ways it could've.
Right off the bat, it's possible
it WAS a fair duel.
Kirito
5010_3_a
Okay, so how do you think a murder
like this happened in a safe zone?
Asuna
5010_2_a
bg_05_restaurant
Kirito
5010_1_a
Alright...
Yolko
5009_38_a
Yolko, you have to stay there,
okay? Seriously, don't go anywhere
until we get back.
Kirito
5009_37_a
Okay, but first we should make
sure she gets back to the inn.
Kirito
5009_36_a
We'll help you get in touch with
Schmitt. I know someone in the
Holy Dragon Alliance who can help.
Asuna
5009_35_a
He needs to know what happened...
before what happened to Kains
happens to him...
Yolko
5009_34_a
I need to see him right away.
Could you please take me to him?
Yolko
5009_33_a
Well, I've run into him a couple
times while clearing bosses, so...
Kirito
5009_32_a
Wait, do you really know Schmitt?
Yolko
5009_31_a
He's leader of the defense unit
of the Holy Dragon Alliance, right?
He's an exceptional lancer.
Asuna
5009_30_a
The other's a tank named Schmitt.
He's on the front lines with the
Holy Dragon Alliance now.
Yolko
5009_29_a
Then who's the third person?
Kirito
5009_28_a
...!
Kirito
5009_27_a
Kains was one of the three who
wanted to keep the ring for the
guild. I was the other one.
Yolko
5009_26_a
then he's probably going after the
three guild members who voted
against selling the ring.
Yolko
5009_25_a
If Grimlock really is the one who
murdered Kains yesterday...
Yolko
5009_24_a
They made a great couple and got
along as husband and wife.
Yolko
5009_23_a
Well, I guess for starters, he was
Griselda's husband. Oh, in-game I
mean.
Yolko
5009_22_a
Probably...
Tell us what you know about
Grimlock.
Kirito
5009_21_a
My guess is the killer struck
before Griselda sold the ring.
Asuna
5009_20_a
We have our suspects. Now we just
have to figure out who didn't want
to sell the ring.
Kirito
5009_19_a
So...the killer is one of the
seven others in our guild?
Yolko
5009_18_a
She wasn't a random victim. It
has to be someone who knew she had
the ring. The killer wanted it.
Kirito
5009_17_a
Griselda was dead.
To this day, I still don't know
how she died.
Yolko
5009_16_a
but she never came back. It wasn't
till later that we learned our
worst fears had come true.
Yolko
5009_15_a
She was going to sell it to a
broker and was staying overnight.
We waited and waited,
Yolko
5009_14_a
Our leader, Griselda, took it to a
large town on the front lines.
Yolko
5009_13_a
We couldn't agree, and in the end
we put it to a vote. It was five
to three in favor of selling it.
Yolko
5009_12_a
Some of us wanted to keep it
for the guild. Others wanted to
sell it and split the earnings.
Yolko

a powerful ring that raised a

Golden Apple was the name we chose

Yolko
5009_9_a
I should tell you about how
my guild was destroyed.
Yolko
5009_8_a
It's something I've been trying
very hard to forget. But now
I have no choice...
Yolko
5009_7_a
Yes, I can... I should've told you
everything yesterday. It's just,
I couldn't.
Yolko
5009_6_a
We found out Grimlock made it.
Can you think of any reason
why he'd do that?
Kirito
5009_5_a
Listen, we took the spear that
impaled Kains to an appraiser. We
had him go over it carefully.
Kirito
5009_4_a
Yes... I have. Actually, until a
few months ago, he was in the
guild with me and Kains.
Yolko
5009_3_a
So, Yolko... We, uh, we were
wondering if you've ever heard
the name "Grimlock"?
Asuna
5009_2_a
bg_05_restaurant
Yolko
5009_1_a
Uh, yeah...
Agil
5008_14_a
Would you stop being so reckless?
Agil, would you please hold onto
this for us?
Asuna
5008_13_a
I know. But we need to find out
what this thing's capable of,
don't we?
Kirito
5008_12_a
Are you out of your mind?!
That thing's already killed
one person!
Asuna
5008_11_a
Wait, stop!
Asuna
5008_10_a
Seriously? Guilty Thorn? Hm...
Let's see how well this thing cuts.
My hand should do the trick...
Kirito
5008_9_a
You'll love it. "Guilty Thorn."
There's a name for you. It kinda
fits, though, don't you think?
Agil
5008_8_a
Is there an item name listed?
Kirito
5008_7_a
Grimlock... Never heard that name
before. Far as I can tell, there's
nothing special about this.
Agil

item_05_guilty_sawn
Hm... A player made this.
Agil
5008_5_a
item_05_guilty_sawn
We're pretty sure of that.
And then there's this.
The murder weapon.
Kirito
5008_4_a
His death was too elaborate to be
some random duel. The PKer who
did this had it planned out.
Kirito
5008_3_a
bg_05_agil_shop
His HP dropped to zero in a
safe zone? You sure it wasn't
a duel?
Agil
5008_2_a
Kirito
5008_1_a
Ah...haha...
Kirito
5007_13_a
What're you doing hanging around
with Asuna? I thought you guys
hated each other's guts!
Agil
5007_12_a
What the hell's gotten into you?!
You're supposed to be a
solo player, man!
Agil
5007_11_a
Kirito
5007_9_a
Wh-!
Agil
5007_10_a
...
Asuna
5007_8_a
That "selling cheap" part's
a lie, though.
Kirito
5007_7_a
Agil
5007_6_a
Buy cheap and sell cheap,
that's my motto. I'm a
businessman, you know that.
Agil
5007_5_a
No way! Kirito!
Agil
5007_4_a
Looks like you're still running
all the suckers down with
those hard deals of yours.
Kirito
5007_3_a
Ugh... Yeah, whatever...
Male
5007_2_a
bg_05_agil_shop
Thanks, my man.
Come back any time!
Agil
5007_1_a
Anyway, let's go find
that item merchant of yours.
Asuna
5006_14_a
Oh, never mind.
Just call me Asuna.
Asuna
5006_13_a
O-Okay, should I call you "miss"
next time? "Vice Commander?"
"Lightning Flash"?
Kirito
5006_12_a
By the way,
try not be so rude when
you're speaking to me.
Asuna
5006_11_a
Well, I happen to know an
item merchant who might
be able to help us out.
Kirito
5006_10_a
No, I don't. And neither do you.
Asuna
5006_9_a
We'll need to find someone
with an appraisal skill. I mean, it's
pretty obvious you don't have one.
Kirito
5006_8_a
If we can find out where that
spear came from, it might lead
us straight to the killer.
Asuna
5006_7_a
Simple. We follow the only
solid clue we have.
Asuna
5006_6_a
So, what do we do?
Kirito
5006_5_a
Okay...
Yolko
5006_4_a
No worries. But we'd like to talk
to you again tomorrow, if you're
feeling up to it.
Asuna
5006_3_a
Thank you for walking me back.
Sorry if it's out of your way.
Yolko
5006_2_a
bg_05_marten_inn
Asuna
5006_1_a
...No...
Yolko
5005_36_a
Could there be someone,
anyone, with a reason to kill him?
Kirito
5005_35_a
Um... I know this is hard for you,
but think back and try to remember.
Kirito
5005_34_a
No...
Yolko
5005_33_a
And this person, had you
seen them before?
Asuna
5005_32_a
...
Kirito
5005_31_a
For a second there...I'm not sure,
but I think I did see someone
standing behind Kains...
Yolko
5005_30_a
Was there anyone else up there?
Asuna
5005_29_a
But we got separated in the plaza.
I looked around for him, then I saw
him hanging from that balcony and...
Yolko
5005_28_a
Anyway, we came here together
today. We were going to have dinner
somewhere in town...
Yolko
5005_27_a
I-I knew him. His name was Kains,
and the two of us used to belong
to the same guild...
Yolko
5005_26_a
Uh, um...
My name is Yolko.
Yolko
5005_25_a
Listen up. Did anyone see what
happened before that player died?
If someone did, please speak up!
Kirito
5005_24_a
Okay, but you're the one
who was napping...
Kirito
5005_23_a
Until we do, there won't be
any time for napping, okay?
Asuna
5005_22_a
Listen, you're going to work
with me until we solve this thing.
Asuna
5005_21_a
Yeah, you're right...
Kirito
5005_20_a
If someone's found a way to PK
inside, no one's going to be safe
in the towns either.
Asuna
5005_19_a
A player takes huge risks going
outside a safe zone as it is.
Asuna
5005_18_a
Either way, we can't ignore this.
Asuna
5005_17_a
Yeah, but I couldn't see the
winner icon on anyone.
Kirito
5005_16_a
He put a noose around his neck and
pushed him out the window.
Doesn't that sound about right?
Asuna
5005_15_a
Well, there's always the obvious.
There was a duel and the other guy
impaled the victim with that spear.
Asuna
5005_14_a
Kirito
5005_13_a
So any idea how this
could have happened?
Kirito
5005_12_a
There's no one here!
The room's empty!
Asuna
5005_11_a
Tch... Everyone!
Look for the player with the
"duel winner" icon!
Kirito

Aaaaaaahhhh!

you'd do the same for me.
Kirito
5004_11_a
God knows how many times
it's happened. So...anyway,
thank you.
Asuna
5004_10_a
The duel begins like normal, but
the Sleep PKer's doing all
the attacking.
Asuna
5004_9_a
All a Sleep PKer has to do is
manipulate a sleeping player's
finger to click the OK button.
Asuna
5004_8_a
But even if you duel in a safe
zone, your HP still goes
down based on the damage you take.
Kirito
5004_7_a
Duels are normally supposed to be
tests of strength, not a fight
to the death.
Kirito
5004_6_a
Yeah. Now we've got player killers
who're cheating the duel system.
Sleep PKers.
Kirito
5004_5_a
But when you're asleep,
you're vulnerable.
Asuna
5004_4_a
The towns are safe zones, so no
one can attack or kill you unless
you've agreed to a duel.
Asuna
5004_3_a
Well, anyway...
Thank you. For today.
For keeping an eye on me.

Oh, come on! The weather's always
the same here.
Asuna

See? Doesn't that breeze feel
good? And the sun...
Kirito
5003_14_a
...
Asuna
5003_13_a
Yeah, but right now, we're not in
the real world, are we? We're
alive, in Aincrad.
Kirito
5003_12_a
Every day here is another one lost
in the real world.
Asuna
5003_11_a
Whatever. I can't believe you!
Do you even understand what's
going on?
Asuna
5003_10_a
It'd be a waste to have to go to
work on a day like this.
Kirito
5003_9_a
Huh?
Asuna
5003_8_a
Betcha didn't know this is
Aincrad's nicest season, and the
weather's at its optimal setting.
Kirito

And where do I find YOU?
Out here, taking a nap.

Asuna

Sorry,
but I'm not cool with that plan.
Kirito
5001_12_a
And unlike us, if they're killed,
they can always respawn.
Asuna
5001_11_a
In this game,
they ARE just objects.
Asuna
5001_10_a
You think they're alive? Really?
Asuna
5001_9_a
Look, they're-
Kirito
5001_8_a
But they're not just objects! NPCs
are different than rocks and
trees.
Kirito
5001_7_a
And while the boss is busy killing
NPCs, WE can attack it.
And kill it.
Asuna
5001_6_a
Yes, that's the idea.
Asuna
5001_5_a
Wait, you can't be serious! If we
do, the boss will go after the
villagers!
Kirito

Lure it to the village. That's how
we get the boss.

us right to the Hill of Memories.

If your listening skill is high
enough, you can. It takes practice
not that many players have it.
Kirito

B-But they can't! I mean,
you can't hear through a door

Who was it?

Who's there?!
Kirito
4005_44_a
This is the town area of Floor 47,
and that's the Hill of Memories. I
was thinking that if we take this...
Kirito

Wow! It's pretty!
Silica

It's a Mirage Sphere. It's kinda

Kirito...?
Silica
4005_26_a
But Sword Art Online is definitely
not a normal game.
Kirito
4005_25_a
In a normal game, they roleplay as
the bad guy, have some laughs,
and it's cool.
Kirito
4005_24_a
They kill other players?!
Silica
4005_23_a
There're also red players, also
known as PKers, the worst.
They're all about murder.
Kirito

See how our cursors are green?
Commit a crime against another
player and it turns orange.
Kirito

a game as the bad guy.

Maybe they're right.
They call me "Dragon Tamer" and I
guess it went to my head...
Silica

No... They don't take me
seriously. They want me to be

with why I'm here. We'll be
helping each other out.

I'll tell you, but only if you
promise not to laugh. Okay?

But...why would you do all of
this for me?
Silica

Take this. It should boost you
five or six levels. And if I tag
along, I'm sure it'll work out.

It's okay. You have three days.

Unfortunately, you can only use

days after death...
Kirito

Thank you so much for telling me
about it! If I work hard to raise
my level, then someday I could...
Silica
4003_19_a
The thing is, the flower won't
bloom unless the familiar's
master's there.
Kirito
4003_18_a
I'd offer to go get it for you
all you'd have to do is pay for
the trip.
Kirito
4003_17_a
Floor 47, huh?
That's way too hard for me...
Silica
4003_16_a
I heard somewhere that the flower
growing at the top can revive
familiars.
Kirito
4003_15_a
Uh huh. On the south side of
Floor 47, there's a field dungeon
called the Hill of Memories.
Kirito
4003_14_a
No way, really?!

Hey, don't cry. That means Pina's

But some day, if we get strong
enough, we'll join the elites in

I like to think we have that same

still need their protection.

I guess they have the will to
stick up for their friends, or any

Keita

Yeah, you're probably right.
But I think what really sets them
apart is willpower.
Keita

With that, they can find out the
easiest ways to get EXP, and they
don't share that info.

Listen up, everyone. I've only
got one thing to say to you!
Diavel
2005_1_a
Urk...
Kirito
2004_9_a
Uh huh.
Asuna
2004_8_a
Okay, level with me.
Is this the first time you've ever
been in a party?
Kirito
2004_7_a
What's a switch?
Asuna
2004_6_a
When I do, switch and jump in.
Kirito
2004_5_a
I'll use a parry to knock their
weapons up and out of the way.
Kirito
2004_4_a
I know.
Asuna
2004_3_a
We're the backup, so our target's
gonna be the boss's minions:
the Ruin Kobold Sentinels.
Kirito
2004_2_a
bg_02_forest
Let's go over it again.
Kirito
2004_1_a
So try not to die tomorrow.
Kirito
2003_18_a
I wouldn't want a party member
dying on me.
Kirito
2003_17_a
Even if a monster beats me and I
die...I won't lose to this game,
or this world. No matter what.
Asuna
2003_16_a
I'd rather stay the way I am till
the last moment.
Asuna
2003_15_a
I don't want to lock myself in a
room in the Town of Beginnings
and slowly rot away.
Asuna
2003_14_a
So I don't lose sight of who I am.
Asuna
2003_13_a
Okay, why are you here?
Kirito
2003_12_a
No. I appreciate the offer, but...
I didn't come to this town to eat
good food.
Asuna
2003_11_a
You wanna know how I did it?
Kirito
2003_10_a
I got it from "The Heifer Strikes
Back." That's a quest in the
village before this one.
Kirito
2003_9_a
...!
Asuna
2003_8_a
still_02_asuna_cream
Cream...?
Asuna
2003_7_a
Huh...?
Asuna
2003_6_a
item_02_cream
Try it with some of that.
Kirito
2003_5_a
Uh huh. 'Course, I got a trick to
make it taste better.
Kirito
2003_4_a
You really think these taste good?
Asuna
2003_3_a
Those are pretty good,
aren't they?
Kirito
2003_2_a
item_02_bread
bg_02_alley
...
Asuna
2003_1_a
That's it for the briefing.
We leave tomorrow at ten in the
morning. Meeting adjourned!
Diavel
2002_50_a
Illfang carries an axe and a
buckler. When his last health bar
turns red, he switches to a talwar.
Diavel
2002_49_a
Also, he'll be surrounded by his
minions, the Ruin Kobold Sentinels.
Diavel
2002_48_a
According to the book, the boss's
name is "Illfang the Kobold Lord."
Diavel
2002_47_a
For info on the boss, it's all in
here. The latest issue of the
guidebook you just heard about.
Diavel
2002_46_a
Okay. Can we get back to the
meeting now?
Diavel
2002_45_a
...Hmph.
Kibaou
2002_44_a
Agil
2002_43_a
I'm here 'cause I want to find out
how we're gonna beat that boss.
Agil
2002_42_a
I didn't come here to point
fingers at anyone. I'm here 'cause
I want to learn from their deaths.
Agil
2002_41_a
Everyone had equal access to this
information. Even so, lots of
players still died.
Agil
2002_40_a
...
Kibaou
2002_39_a
The ex-beta testers were the ones
handing these out for free at the
item shop.
Agil
2002_38_a
item_02_guidebook
Kibaou, you got this guidebook
too, right?
Agil
2002_37_a
still_02_agil_introduction
The name's Agil.
Agil
2002_36_a
still_02_agil_introduction
Can I say something?
Agil
2002_35_a
...
Kirito
2002_34_a
They can't expect the party to
trust them when they don't trust
us! Why should we?!
Kibaou
2002_33_a
We should make 'em apologize!
And make 'em give up all their
money and the items they got too!
Kibaou
2002_32_a
They were the only ones getting
stronger in here.
Kibaou
2002_31_a
They snagged all the good hunting
spots, and they grabbed all the
easy quests too.
Kibaou
2002_30_a
The day this stupid-ass game
started, the beta guys just up and
vanished, right? They ditched us!
Kibaou
2002_29_a
...?!
Kirito
2002_28_a
We all know about the people who
died so far, yeah?! Some of you
gotta apologize to them right now!
Kibaou
2002_27_a
Before we take on the boss, I want
to get something off my chest.
Kibaou
2002_26_a
My name's Kibaou, got that?
Kibaou
2002_25_a
Hold on a sec!
Kibaou
2002_24_a
Alright, looks like everyone's
teamed up. Now then...
Diavel
2002_23_a
(Her name's...Asuna. A girl?)
Kirito
2002_22_a
...
Asuna
2002_21_a
still_02_party_accept
...Fine.
???
2002_20_a
It would only be for this fight...
Kirito
2002_19_a
So you're solo too.
You want to form a party with me?
Kirito
2002_18_a
...Not even. I wasn't left out.
It's just...everyone seems like
they're already friends.
???
2002_17_a
You got left out too, huh?
Kirito
2002_16_a
...
???
2002_15_a
This...is bad!
Kirito
2002_14_a
Wait, what...?!
Kirito
2002_13_a
First off, we'll team up into
parties of six.
Diavel
2002_12_a
Glad to hear you're all with me
on this. Now, let's figure out how
we're gonna beat this boss.
Diavel
2002_11_a
Wow...
Kirito
2002_10_a
Yeah!
Assault Team
2002_9_a
Do you agree, or not?!
Diavel
2002_8_a
Fact is, it's our duty as the most
capable players here.
Diavel
2002_7_a
The next step is to tell everyone
waiting at the Town of Beginnings
that we can beat this game!
Diavel
2002_6_a
We need to defeat the boss and
make it to Floor 2.
Diavel
2002_5_a
Here's the deal: our party found
the boss room at the top of the
tower today.
Diavel
2002_4_a
still_02_diabel_introduction
Hahaha! Dude, there's no job
system in this game!
Assault Team Member
2002_3_a
still_02_diabel_introduction
My name is Diavel, and in this
game, the job I rolled is knight!
Diavel
2002_2_a
bg_02_colloseo
Okay, people!
Now that everyone's here,
let's get this meeting started!
Diavel
2002_1_a
And today, finally, we're having a
meeting to figure out how to find
and defeat the Floor 1 boss.
Kirito
2001_5_a
I used to be a beta tester,
and even I haven't found out where
the boss's lair is.
Kirito
2001_4_a
After all of this time, none of
the players have been able to
clear Floor 1.
Kirito
2001_3_a
Since the game began, a whole month
has gone by, and two thousand
people have died so far.
Kirito
2001_2_a
bg_02_fountain
December 2nd, 2022
Floor 1: Tolbana
2001_1_a
...And we still haven't beaten
Floor 1.
Kirito
1002_2_a
bg_11_starting_city
A month after the game started,
two thousand players were
already dead.
Kirito
1002_1_a
bg_01_field
I can do this! This world can't
beat me... I will survive!!
Kirito
1001_15_a
Klein
1001_14_a
I'll be seeing you, Klein.
Take care.
Kirito
1001_13_a
Sure!
Klein
1001_12_a
But if you're in a jam, you
message me. Okay?
Kirito
1001_11_a
Okay...
Kirito
1001_10_a
And with all the stuff you taught
me, I'll get by. No sweat!
Klein
1001_9_a
I'll be fine. Last game I played,
I ran a guild. I'm more than
prepared.
Klein
1001_8_a
...
Kirito
1001_7_a
I can't leave them.
Klein
1001_6_a
Well...thanks... But I stood in
line all night with my friends to
buy SAO.
Klein
1001_5_a
We'll have an easier time
collecting cash and points if we
operate out of the next village.
Kirito
1001_4_a
If what he said is true, the only
way we'll survive is by making
ourselves as strong as possible.
Kirito
1001_3_a
Huh...?
Klein
1001_2_a
bg_01_town_alley
Okay, listen. I'm heading out
right now for the next village.
I want you to come.
Kirito
1001_1_a
still_01_tutorial_end
I grabbed Klein and ducked into
a quiet alley.
Kirito
4_25_a
still_01_tutorial_end
I was different. Glancing around
at the other players, I made my
decision.
Kirito
4_24_a
still_01_tutorial_end
Some listened to his declaration
in shocked silence. Some screamed.
Some broke down in tears.
Kirito
4_23_a
still_01_red_robe
and beat the game.
Kirito
4_22_a
still_01_red_robe
The only way for us to escape SAO
was to climb to the top of
Aincrad, to Floor 100...
Kirito
4_21_a
still_01_red_robe
He told us that death in SAO
meant death in the real world.
Kirito
4_20_a
still_01_red_robe
Akihiko Kayaba: the development
director of SAO and the inventor
of the NerveGear.
Kirito
4_19_a
still_01_red_robe
This is how Sword Art Online was
designed to be.
Akihiko Kayaba
4_18_a
still_01_red_robe
I repeat. This is not a defect.
Akihiko Kayaba
4_17_a
still_01_red_robe
Let me assure you,
this is not a defect in the game.
Akihiko Kayaba
4_16_a
still_01_red_robe
I'm sure most of you have already
noticed an item missing from your
main menus. The logout button.
Akihiko Kayaba
4_15_a
still_01_red_robe
My name is Akihiko Kayaba.
And as of this moment,
I am in control of this world.
???
4_14_a
still_01_red_robe
Attention, players.
I welcome you to my world.
???
4_13_a
still_01_red_robe
As fear and uncertainty washed
over us, an avatar in a red robe
appeared in the sky.
Kirito
4_12_a
still_01_no_logout
Suddenly and without warning,
every last SAO player was warped
to the plaza in the starting town.
Kirito
4_11_a
still_01_accident
The logout button that was
supposed to be in the game menu
was gone.
Kirito
4_10_a
still_01_first_battle
We first noticed that something
was wrong right after we beat our
first mob.
Kirito
4_9_a
still_01_first_battle
On that fateful day, I was teaching
Klein, a guy I met in the Town of
Beginnings, the basics of combat.
Kirito
4_8_a
still_01_player
It was an inescapable trap:
a death game.
Kirito
4_7_a
still_01_player
However, when SAO officially
launched, 10,000 players were
unaware of its terrifying secret.
Kirito
4_6_a
still_01_player
giving them the ability to freely
move about a virtual environment.
The ultimate in VR tech.
Kirito
4_5_a
still_01_nervegear
By sending signals directly to the
brain, it can access the user's
senses,
Kirito
4_4_a
still_01_nervegear
The NerveGear is a sleek helmet
that covers the head and face.
Kirito
4_3_a
still_01_aincrad
SAO ran on hardware fundamentally
differently from previous
generation tech. NerveGear.
Kirito
4_2_a
still_01_aincrad
bg_black
Sword Art Online. SAO. That was
the name of the game that became
my world.
Kirito
4_1_a
At that moment, my life ended,
and a new life began.
Kirito
3_6_a
It was two years ago.
Kirito
3_5_a
My thoughts were dim, hazy...
and I thought back to the past...
Kirito
3_4_a
The red line only had a few pixels
left.
Kirito
3_3_a
I nearly collapsed from exhaustion
when the battle ended.
I glanced down at my HP bar.
Kirito
3_2_a
bg_09_dungeon_boss
Is it...over...?
Kirito
3_1_a
Oh, what the hell!
Klein
1_22_a

Corvatz

The Aincrad Liberation Army
doesn't know the word "retreat"!
Come on! Keep fighting!
Corvatz
1_7_a
No way! No boss room's ever had
a trap like this before!
Asuna

I tried!
It... It didn't work!!!
