orders to attack them came from the upper

watched, Leafa replies that there could be a
tracer following them. They decide to pick
up the pace.

adventuring with Kirito. On returning to ALO,

decide to rotate out so they both can rest.

he saw Kirito in real life in her hospital
room. Knowing that Kirito is alive gives

the Fairy King, plans to perform twisted
experiments on Asuna, whom he has

can now match Leafa's top speed. Sylvain
comes into view as the pair soar through
the sky.
To Sylvain: 2
Kirito opens up to Leafa and sets out for
Sylvain. Leafa attempts to teach him how
to navigate the game's flight controls...with
limited success.

dispatch enemies and send the remaining
Salamanders running for cover with only
the game's starting equipment at his disposal.

Once inside ALO, Kirito is miraculously
reunited with Yui! Kirito begins telling Yui
about the Asuna sighting, but both kick into
high alert upon sensing other players.

fiancee. Dazed, Kirito learns Asuna was seen
in a game called ALO, and dives in after her.

been completed. Kirito and Asuna share their
real names as they watch it collapse. Kirito
wakes in a hospital calling Asuna's name.

Asuna sacrifices herself to save Kirito from a
killing blow, and then dies in his arms. With
nothing left to lose, Kirito confronts
Heathcliff, rage coursing through his veins!

the death. Kirito steels himself, prepared to
use nothing but his own wits to kill Kayaba,
the chief architect of the game itself!
Heathcliff
Kirito unmasks Heathcliff, who rewards his
deductive reasoning by challenging him
to a duel. If he wins, everyone completes
the game and is set free.

reality of losing 14 members with 25 floors
still remaining. Meanwhile, pieces of a long-

Skull Reaper's scythes at bay and order
the panic-stricken Assault Team members

as he and Asuna set out for the front lines.
Making a Life Here
Asuna and Kirito defeat the King Of Lakes
only to get a message from Heathcliff
calling them to the front lines. They make
their way to the Knights' HQ to hear him out.
The King of Lakes
Asuna hesitantly draws her sword amid the
crowd of spectators fleeing in terror.
The King of Lakes
Kirito arranges to fish for the King Of
Lakes with Nishida. He uses "Switch" on
the rod, only to actually land the terrifying
King Of Lakes itself.
The King's Lake
Kirito meets a fisherman named Nishida who
lands a fish too large to cook by himself,
so Kirito offers to help and invites him back
to the house.
Gone Fishing
Yui tells Kirito and Asuna she is an AI that
has longed to meet them both. Kirito
manages to save Yui's heart before the
system deletes her for good.
Yui's Heart
Yui proves to be immune to the Reaper's
attacks and thus the only one capable of
destroying it. She turns to a stunned Kirito
and Asuna and claims her memory has returned.
The Fatal Scythe
The crew finally reaches Thinker, only to find
a Reaper strong enough to appear on Floor 90
blocking the path. Kirito distracts it while
the others get to safety.
Reaper of Blackiron Palace
Kirito leaves a trail of enemies in his wake
as they progress deeper into the dungeon
toward the safe area where they believe
Thinker is being held.

En route to rescue Thinker, the trio are
shocked to learn that a massive dungeon
lies beneath the Town of Beginnings.

Yui insists that she go with Kirito and Asuna
to the dungeon where Thinker is being
held. Feeling as though they have no other
choice, Kirito and Asuna agree to take her.

The next day, a soldier from the army named
Yulier visits Kirito and Asuna, asking for
their assistance in saving Thinker, who
has been deceived by Kibaou.
The Army's Internal Conflict
Asuna and Kirito free the children from the
army, but Yui begins acting very strangely...
Battle in the Safe Zone
Kirito and Asuna find the children the army
have captured and run to their rescue.
The Army
Asuna asks Yui if she recognizes any of the
buildings in town, but Yui simply shakes her
head. Asuna and Kirito begin to notice that
the town is far too quiet...
To Floor 1: Town of Beginnings
Asuna and Kirito agree to care for Yui until
her memories return, but decide to look
for her parents in the Town of Beginnings
just in case.
